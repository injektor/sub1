00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,080
<font color="yellow">and not asking about it.</font>

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,640
<font color="yellow">It's about being by the person's side in quiet support.</font>

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,510
<font color="yellow">First, the scar must be identified.</font>

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,540
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,910
<font color="yellow">It's you, Doctor!</font>

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,390
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Thank you for coming.</font>

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,320
<font color="yellow">I missed Ms Kang's soup.</font>

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,910
<font color="yellow">I can't care less about the reason.</font>

14
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,540
<font color="yellow">Anyone close to Hye Jung is most welcome here.</font>

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,110
<font color="yellow">I won't be eating here, but I'll take out three servings.</font>

16
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,610
<font color="yellow">Please wait a moment. I will prepare it right away.</font>

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,140
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,810
<font color="yellow">are you familiar with Dr Jung Yoon Do?</font>

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,380
<font color="yellow">He's here right now.</font>

21
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,680
<font color="yellow">- A lot of hot sauce, please.
-  Sure thing.</font>

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,850
<font color="yellow">Were you the operating surgeon?</font>

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,850
<font color="yellow">Yes. I earned some points with that.</font>

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,240
<font color="yellow">You haven't given up yet?</font>

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,680
<font color="yellow">I hope I had a zipper on my heart...</font>

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,010
<font color="yellow">so I can open and shut it as I please.</font>

27
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,680
<font color="yellow">I know why you got rejected.</font>

28
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,540
<font color="yellow">Don't say such cheesy things.</font>

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,380
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for getting rejected.</font>

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,880
<font color="yellow">It's only because I was denied the first goal.</font>

31
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,480
<font color="yellow">Your takeout is ready!</font>

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,930
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

33
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,840
<font color="yellow">I have one for you too, Doctor.</font>

34
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,910
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
-  No problem.</font>

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,450
<font color="yellow">You visited my father?</font>

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,310
<font color="yellow">I went to Grandma's Diner.</font>

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,430
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing.</font>

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,960
<font color="yellow">It's not the same thing. I had a different purpose.</font>

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,100
<font color="yellow">I went to buy soup. You said that was okay.</font>

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,780
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,460
<font color="yellow">But hearing that you met my father again...</font>

42
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,700
<font color="yellow">upsets me.</font>

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,710
<font color="yellow">The fact that it upsets you upsets me.</font>

44
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,080
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

45
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,340
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Why don't you lose to me?</font>

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
<font color="yellow">I lost to you before.</font>

47
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,510
<font color="yellow">It seemed to me that you didn't know the value of losing.</font>

48
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,750
<font color="yellow">Do you know that you sound like a teacher right now?</font>

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,710
<font color="yellow">That's my job. Of course I sound like a teacher.</font>

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,930
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong!</font>

51
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,370
<font color="yellow">You should experience it too.</font>

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,230
<font color="yellow">You should experience the feeling I had...</font>

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,510
<font color="yellow">when I had a meltdown because of you.</font>

54
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,180
<font color="yellow">You're very stubborn.</font>

55
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,960
<font color="yellow">You still hold grudges like you used to.</font>

56
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,240
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking. You're just the same.</font>

57
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,080
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

58
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,190
<font color="yellow">I told you to taper the doses of steroid. Why didn't you do it?</font>

59
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,910
<font color="yellow">I was going to make Kang Soo do it, but the emergency happened.</font>

60
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,960
<font color="yellow">Is Kang Soo the only person at the Department of Neurosurgery?</font>

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,190
<font color="yellow">If Kang Soo's busy, you should've come and done it yourself.</font>

62
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,470
<font color="yellow">You're still a resident.</font>

63
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,880
<font color="yellow">Are you already used to giving orders?</font>

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,030
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

65
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,340
<font color="yellow">Do you have to mess things up...</font>

66
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,980
<font color="yellow">and ruin my morning?</font>

67
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,980
<font color="yellow">It won't affect Hae's radiation therapy. Let it slide.</font>

68
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:30,640
<font color="yellow">Go find Joong Dae, or make sure things run smoothly without him.</font>

69
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,010
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,910
<font color="yellow">Darn it! Where is Joong Dae?</font>

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,710
<font color="yellow">Tonight tomorrow night I can't stop thinking about him</font>

72
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,740
<font color="yellow">Oh gosh!</font>

73
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,040
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
-  I'm cleaning.</font>

74
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,880
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to go back to the hospital?</font>

75
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,380
<font color="yellow">- It's already been two days.
-  I won't go.</font>

76
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,820
<font color="yellow">They don't even care about me.</font>

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,580
<font color="yellow">I will recuperate here for a week and return home.</font>

78
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,590
<font color="yellow">You're going to recuperate here?</font>

79
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. I feel comfortable here.</font>

80
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,010
<font color="yellow">What should I do after cleaning?</font>

81
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,340
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten?
-  I ate the food in the fridge.</font>

82
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,440
<font color="yellow">Why would you eat my food?</font>

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,100
<font color="yellow">You locked the door on the way out, so I couldn't leave.</font>

84
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,500
<font color="yellow">Should I have just starved to death?</font>

85
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,530
<font color="yellow">When did I tell you to die? You should've called me!</font>

86
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,610
<font color="yellow">But what if Dr Yoo finds me? I'll be sent back to the hospital.</font>

87
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,420
<font color="yellow">I can tell Hye Jung myself.</font>

88
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,580
<font color="yellow">But you won't tell her.</font>

89
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,140
<font color="yellow">I believe you to be a loyal...</font>

90
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,910
<font color="yellow">with a good conscience.</font>

91
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,230
<font color="yellow">Then put your back into it.</font>

92
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,810
<font color="yellow">Think of it as your lodging fee.</font>

93
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
<font color="yellow">- It's your lodging fee.
-  Let's make it shine!</font>

94
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,510
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,910
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

96
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,450
<font color="yellow">- I'm going mad without Joong Dae.
-  That's how it is.</font>

97
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,410
<font color="yellow">How can he not come in without notice?</font>

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,380
<font color="yellow">- He did contact me.
-  Did he really?</font>

99
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,710
<font color="yellow">I can't put up with the insults any more.</font>

100
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,360
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything you've done. I'm never going back.</font>

101
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,710
<font color="yellow">What? Who insulted him?</font>

102
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,110
<font color="yellow">Was it me?</font>

103
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,700
<font color="yellow">Yes. You're so old-fashioned.</font>

104
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,630
<font color="yellow">- I am?
-  Why would you beat him?</font>

105
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,070
<font color="yellow">I do what I do to ensure you become great doctors.</font>

106
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,810
<font color="yellow">You can't beat someone who will be great.</font>

107
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,690
<font color="yellow">You should buy him jokbal like Yeong Gook.</font>

108
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,740
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

109
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,350
<font color="yellow">How can the second-year resident run away?</font>

110
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,670
<font color="yellow">You should've been nicer to him. Why would you beat him up?</font>

111
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,790
<font color="yellow">What? It's so easy to make a person seem devilish.</font>

112
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,680
<font color="yellow">The one who ran away is at fault. I want to run away too!</font>

113
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what in the world?</font>

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,040
<font color="yellow">Call Joong Dae.</font>

115
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,580
<font color="yellow">(My lovely Dad)</font>

116
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,380
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello.</font>

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,910
<font color="yellow">Surprise!</font>

118
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,410
<font color="yellow">It's all yours.</font>

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,010
<font color="yellow">- Hae, are you feeling good today?
-  Yes, I feel great.</font>

120
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,380
<font color="yellow">You're getting the radiation therapy with me today, right?</font>

121
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,740
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,690
<font color="yellow">Just like the robot you love, you'll be wearing a helmet.</font>

123
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,740
<font color="yellow">It will last for 40 to 50 minutes. You can handle it, right?</font>

124
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,000
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,640
<font color="yellow">Today's the first day, so let's cheer up.</font>

126
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,080
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,480
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Hae and Dal's guardian by any chance?</font>

128
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,450
<font color="yellow">I have to settle the medical fees, but I can't find him.</font>

129
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,820
<font color="yellow">I think he comes in at night.</font>

130
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,310
<font color="yellow">If you see him, please call the Administrative Office.</font>

131
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,380
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

132
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
<font color="yellow">I feel really bad for Hae and Dal's father.</font>

133
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,180
<font color="yellow">His wife passed away from cancer, so he accumulated a lot of debt.</font>

134
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,540
<font color="yellow">How will he afford the boys' medical fees?</font>

135
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,810
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

136
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,910
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,630
<font color="yellow">I prescribed a small dose of pain killers to Nam Dal...</font>

138
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,280
<font color="yellow">to ease the pain on the wound. He's not vomiting.</font>

139
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,310
<font color="yellow">- Did he have any seizures?
-  None.</font>

140
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in the evening?</font>

141
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,600
<font color="yellow">I have to meet Dr Kim. We have to plan a project together.</font>

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
<font color="yellow">What project?</font>

143
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,710
<font color="yellow">It's a project that develops dopamine sensors for DBS.</font>

144
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,180
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

145
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,040
<font color="yellow">If it goes well, I can overturn the hospital's political climate.</font>

146
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,310
<font color="yellow">Hae, Dal, I'm here.</font>

147
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,880
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo!</font>

148
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,510
<font color="yellow">Walk slowly.</font>

149
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,780
<font color="yellow">Dal, what have you been doing?</font>

150
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,860
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting for Dad.</font>

151
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,380
<font color="yellow">Are you all right, Dal?</font>

152
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,980
<font color="yellow">- It hurts here.

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,710
<font color="yellow">It's not because I'm ashamed.</font>

308
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,380
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm not yet sure if you're someone...</font>

309
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,510
<font color="yellow">I can speak openly to.</font>

310
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,810
<font color="yellow">I saw you at Gukil Medical Center.</font>

311
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,910
<font color="yellow">It was a passing glance,</font>

312
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,140
<font color="yellow">but I think it was you.</font>

313
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,480
<font color="yellow">Why do you suddenly care who I am?</font>

314
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,820
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you.</font>

315
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,910
<font color="yellow">I think I stand a better chance with you than with Prof. Hong.</font>

316
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,040
<font color="yellow">I'm a fellow at Gukil Medical Center.</font>

317
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,510
<font color="yellow">A fellow?</font>

318
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,510
<font color="yellow">You're fully qualified.</font>

319
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,480
<font color="yellow">Yet you're doing this to a fellow doctor?</font>

320
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,410
<font color="yellow">Yes. To a fellow doctor.</font>

321
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,980
<font color="yellow">How nice and simple.</font>

322
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,410
<font color="yellow">My hospital...</font>

323
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,080
<font color="yellow">botched my wife's C-section,</font>

324
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,310
<font color="yellow">and she suffered for months.</font>

325
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,350
<font color="yellow">I let it slide because I'm a doctor.</font>

326
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,010
<font color="yellow">I understand mistakes.</font>

327
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,710
<font color="yellow">I don't have to accept your view of medical practices.</font>

328
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,910
<font color="yellow">Just tell me what happened in the OR that day.</font>

329
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,350
<font color="yellow">I'll decide what happens next.</font>

330
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,880
<font color="yellow">Nothing much happened.</font>

332
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,850
<font color="yellow">The tumour's bigger than I thought.</font>

333
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,080
<font color="yellow">Keep it still.</font>

334
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,410
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

335
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,410
<font color="yellow">President Jin did his best.</font>

336
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,480
<font color="yellow">That's the truth.</font>

337
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,280
<font color="yellow">The nurses didn't bring the blood bags into our OR.</font>

338
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,460
<font color="yellow">That was a different surgery.</font>

339
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,910
<font color="yellow">My grandmother's surgery was the only one at the time.</font>

340
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,380
<font color="yellow">- How did you know that?
-  You're admitting it.</font>

341
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,910
<font color="yellow">I just threw it out there.</font>

342
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,540
<font color="yellow">Well, this is encouraging...</font>

343
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,310
<font color="yellow">since I got to peek into the operating room.</font>

344
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,610
<font color="yellow">Let's make more progress next time.</font>

345
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,380
<font color="yellow">Hae, how are you feeling today?</font>

346
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,810
<font color="yellow">- Is Hae going to die?
-  No, he'll be fine.</font>

347
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,210
<font color="yellow">How is he doing?</font>

348
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,480
<font color="yellow">He keeps vomiting. He feels weak too.</font>

349
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,110
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at him.</font>

350
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,780
<font color="yellow">Let's see, Hae.</font>

351
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,910
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look, okay?</font>

352
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,610
<font color="yellow">Can you hold my finger?</font>

353
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,680
<font color="yellow">Try to hold it tightly.</font>

354
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,540
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

355
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,780
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the thing you wore on your head earlier?</font>

356
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,770
<font color="yellow">Only brave, cool kids get to wear that.</font>

357
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,710
<font color="yellow">But since you're so amazing, it might be a bit difficult.</font>

358
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,210
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can do it?</font>

359
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,640
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  You're an amazing boy.</font>

360
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,910
<font color="yellow">Then get some sleep. You should sleep it off. Got it?</font>

361
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,380
<font color="yellow">Give him IV drips with vitamins.</font>

362
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,010
<font color="yellow">Since he can't eat, he'll at least need the nutrients to get by.</font>

363
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

364
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,210
<font color="yellow">Dal, where's your dad?</font>

365
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,010
<font color="yellow">He went out to earn money.</font>

366
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,300
<font color="yellow">Are you two going to be okay by yourselves?</font>

367
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,580
<font color="yellow">We're always by ourselves, so it's okay.</font>

368
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,740
<font color="yellow">Dad will be here later.

<font color="yellow">Let's go to bed.</font>

370
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,610
<font color="yellow">I'll bring you a new blanket.</font>

371
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,110
<font color="yellow">Making money is important, but how can he just leave the kids alone...</font>

372
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,940
<font color="yellow">even without a caregiver?</font>

373
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,010
<font color="yellow">I just realised why I don't feel a spark with you.</font>

374
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,210
<font color="yellow">I know why I subconsciously reject you.</font>

375
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,840
<font color="yellow">When I heard you asking Dal where his father is,</font>

376
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,580
<font color="yellow">my heart sank.</font>

377
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,760
<font color="yellow">- Why?
-  What I used to fear the most...</font>

378
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,210
<font color="yellow">when I was a child was, "Where did your mum go?"</font>

379
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,610
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with this?</font>

380
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,010
<font color="yellow">Who do you think those boys need the most right now?</font>

381
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,580
<font color="yellow">It's their dad.</font>

382
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,680
<font color="yellow">They need him a lot more than you do.</font>

383
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,540
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I'm attracting to strong women with emotional wounds?</font>

384
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,110
<font color="yellow">Those who know how to take care of their pain...</font>

385
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,610
<font color="yellow">also know how to be considerate.</font>

386
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,910
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

387
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,040
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

388
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,110
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Are you busy?</font>

389
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,000
<font color="yellow">- What's up?
-  Can I do something bad to you?</font>

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,040
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can.</font>

391
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,910
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm here for.</font>

392
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,810
<font color="yellow">Hearing you say that makes me hesitate.</font>

393
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,280
<font color="yellow">Then can I do it?</font>

394
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,810
<font color="yellow">Sure, whatever it is.</font>

395
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,580
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to return?</font>

396
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,010
<font color="yellow">I won't. I just make everyone's life difficult.</font>

397
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,680
<font color="yellow">Becoming a doctor is so hard. Why would you give that up?</font>

398
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,640
<font color="yellow">Go back.</font>

399
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's very hard.</font>

400
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,280
<font color="yellow">I gave up my personal life to become a doctor.</font>

401
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,910
<font color="yellow">But what is this?</font>

402
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,380
<font color="yellow">Then just go home. Don't hide here like this.</font>

403
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,180
<font color="yellow">How can I go home?</font>

404
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,380
<font color="yellow">My parents fully supported me for all my schooling.</font>

405
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much money they've spent on me?</font>

406
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,560
<font color="yellow">If they find out about me running away, my father will kill me.</font>

407
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,680
<font color="yellow">- Are you scared of your father?
-  Yes, I am.</font>

408
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,610
<font color="yellow">I'm scared of my father too.</font>

409
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:37,810
<font color="yellow">But sleeping here must be so uncomfortable.</font>

410
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,940
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit of a germaphobe,</font>

411
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,410
<font color="yellow">so I don't want to sleep at a motel.</font>

412
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,380
<font color="yellow">You're seriously a handful.</font>

413
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,280
<font color="yellow">- We're here.
-  Thank you.</font>

414
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,500
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come in for a cup of tea?</font>

415
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,260
<font color="yellow">Sure. I would've been upset if you didn't mention it.</font>

416
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,350
<font color="yellow">I've been wanting to visit your place.</font>

417
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,310
<font color="yellow">I'm very tender-hearted,</font>

418
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,510
<font color="yellow">so I'm only letting you stay for a few days since you're a vagrant.</font>

419
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,730
<font color="yellow">I can sleep with Hye Jung for a few days...</font>

420
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,300
<font color="yellow">Neither Soon Hee or myself have brought men home before.</font>

421
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,480
<font color="yellow">- Hye Jung is home!
-  What should we do?</font>

422
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,940
<font color="yellow">Hide. Hurry up!</font>

423
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,680
<font color="yellow">Come on! You have to hide!</font>

424
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,610
<font color="yellow">I've never been to a house shared amongst women.</font>

425
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,030
<font color="yellow">It looks like Soon Hee is home.</font>

426
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,410
<font color="yellow">- Whose shoes are these?
-  They look like men's shoes.</font>

427
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,830
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat.</font>

428
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,180
<font color="yellow">- Shall I sit over there?
-  Sure.</font>

429
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,480
<font color="yellow">- What are we going to do?
-  I don't know.</font>

430
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,270
<font color="yellow">Go away! Gosh, that was too loud.</font>

431
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,030
<font color="yellow">Soon Hee, are you home?</font>

432
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am! I'm coming out now!</font>

433
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,510
<font color="yellow">Stay right here.</font>

434
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,640
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung! You're home so early! I'm so happy to see you.</font>

435
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,840
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung!</font>

436
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,670
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you home so early?</font>

437
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,540
<font color="yellow">I just came to pick up something.</font>

438
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,110
<font color="yellow">Whose shoes are those?</font>

439
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,510
<font color="yellow">Oh, those.</font>

440
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,110
<font color="yellow">I'm collecting them.</font>

441
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

442
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,410
<font color="yellow">Wearing men's shoes is the trend these days.</font>

443
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,100
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong! When did you get here?</font>

444
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,410
<font color="yellow">I've been here for a while, but you didn't even notice me.</font>

445
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,410
<font color="yellow">- Is that what happened?
-  Yes.</font>

446
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,520
<font color="yellow">Girls, is there anything that needs to be repaired?</font>

447
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,580
<font color="yellow">Not at all, Mr Hong!</font>

448
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,540
<font color="yellow">Nothing needs to be repaired.</font>

449
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, you asked me to replace the burnt light bulb in your room.</font>

450
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,410
<font color="yellow">- Really? I'll do it for you.
-  It's okay, Mr Hong!</font>

451
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,910
<font color="yellow">I'll do it. I want to start doing everything on my own.</font>

452
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,890
<font color="yellow">- I can change the light bulb.
-  You're acting strange today.</font>

453
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:09,350
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

454
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:13,540
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong is here to officially meet me as your boyfriend.</font>

455
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,380

632
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,350
