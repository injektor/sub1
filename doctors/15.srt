93
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,570

94
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,770
<font color="yellow">I wondered why he's in neurosurgery.</font>

95
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,440
<font color="yellow">Turns out he's the typical psycho.</font>

96
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,730
<font color="yellow">He might actually become a surgeon.</font>

97

<font color="yellow">Is that a compliment?</font>

98
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,440

<font color="yellow">We believe that we should use the profit...</font>

269
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,180
<font color="yellow">to examine and improve the hospital's welfare systems.</font>

270
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,010
<font color="yellow">A hospital must be a place where doctors and patients can coexist.</font>

271

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,570
<font color="yellow">I'm your dad who loves you and supports you more than anyone else.</font>

305
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,710
<font color="yellow">I love you too.</font>

306
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,760
<font color="yellow">- That's why I've endured this much.
-  What have you endured?</font>

307
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,310
<font color="yellow">What did you say in front of Hye Jung?</font>

308
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,140
<font color="yellow">"Seo Woo is too unbending and straightforward,"</font>

309
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,040
<font color="yellow">- "so she's not good with people."
-  It's true.</font>

310
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,280
<font color="yellow">Then can I also tell you the truth?</font>

311
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,210
<font color="yellow">I got into the university you failed to get in.</font>

312
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,460
<font color="yellow">I also have good looks which you don't have.</font>

313
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,750
<font color="yellow">- I also have...
-  That's all I gave you!</font>

314
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,240
<font color="yellow">If you grew up in the environment that Hye Jung was raised in,</font>

315
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,040
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't be where you are now!</font>

316
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,180
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't be here without all of Grandpa's help either!</font>

317
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,970
<font color="yellow">I was a good student at least.</font>

318
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,770
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

319
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:58,640
<font color="yellow">So why did you...</font>

320
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,140
<font color="yellow">(Department of Neurosurgery, Professor Hong Ji Hong)</font>

321
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,340
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you surprised me.</font>

322
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,340
<font color="yellow">Did I surprise you?</font>

323
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,840
<font color="yellow">A little. You didn't tell me you were coming.</font>

324
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,180
<font color="yellow">Do I have to tell you I am coming?</font>

325
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,140
<font color="yellow">I think I need to answer carefully to that.</font>

326
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

327
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,530
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me that you're attending the board meeting?</font>

328
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,740
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to hear that from Kyung Joon?</font>

329
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,140
<font color="yellow">- I'm scary, aren't I?
-  A little.</font>

330
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,540
<font color="yellow">You have to make sure to take vitamin D.</font>

331
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,340
<font color="yellow">It's important for people like us who don't see any sunlight.</font>

332
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,670
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

333
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,740
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that you're going to get sick.</font>

334
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,410
<font color="yellow">Can we get off work together today?</font>

335
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,340
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment today.</font>

336
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,510
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

337
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,480
<font color="yellow">I am eating dinner with Dr Kim to discuss about the investment.</font>

338
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,540
<font color="yellow">Did I pass?</font>

339
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,940
<font color="yellow">Yes. You pass.</font>

340
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?</font>

341
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,410
<font color="yellow">I want to check on you all the time.</font>

342
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,140
<font color="yellow">You're going to get tired of me, right?</font>

343
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,840
<font color="yellow">I won't. It's okay if you check on me all the time.</font>

344
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,010
<font color="yellow">What's this now?</font>

345
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,840
<font color="yellow">Drink up. It's vitamin C.</font>

346
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,010
<font color="yellow">I don't like this. It makes me feel like a child.</font>

347
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,540
<font color="yellow">No, you don't get to say no. This is for your health.</font>

348
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,870
<font color="yellow">It tastes just fine. Gosh.</font>

349
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,290
<font color="yellow">Finish it.</font>

350
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,310
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

351
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,150
<font color="yellow">Am I right? Dr Pi...</font>

352
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,240
<font color="yellow">Dr Pi's coming too? Is he?</font>

353
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,010
<font color="yellow">No, I'm here alone today. Give me some drinks.</font>

354
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,970
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

355
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,860
<font color="yellow">By the way, is Dr Ahn Joong Dae at the hospital?</font>

356
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,970
<font color="yellow">I guess he is.</font>

357
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,600
<font color="yellow">He's probably going to get punished for a month.</font>

358
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,470
<font color="yellow">He ran away, and he got caught just today.</font>

359
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,610
<font color="yellow">I heard Hye Jung caught him.</font>

360
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,570
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

361
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,070
<font color="yellow">But she wouldn't say where he caught him.</font>

362
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,940
<font color="yellow">Did she tell you?</font>

363
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about it.</font>

364
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,640
<font color="yellow">You two have secrets too?</font>

365
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,300
<font color="yellow">We don't have secrets.</font>

366
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,610
<font color="yellow">Then do you know why Hye Jung came to our hospital?</font>

367
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,030
<font color="yellow">She must've gone there because it's a big hospital!</font>

368
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,970
<font color="yellow">Your hospital's cafeteria has the best food.</font>

369
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
<font color="yellow">You two have secrets.</font>

370
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,570
<font color="yellow">She didn't tell you about it.</font>

371
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is she saying?</font>

372
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,240
<font color="yellow">You look happy. Are you in love?</font>

373
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,140
<font color="yellow">I will tell you later.</font>

374
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,630
<font color="yellow">You are in love.</font>

375
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,740
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

376
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,110
<font color="yellow">What's that? What was that sound?</font>

377
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,240
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

378
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,140
<font color="yellow">I feel good to see you happy.</font>

379
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,370
<font color="yellow">Ever since your father passed, we haven't done this.</font>

380
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,220
<font color="yellow">I miss him a lot today.</font>

381
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,670
<font color="yellow">You were his most beloved student.</font>

382
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,610
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong,</font>

383
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,970
<font color="yellow">you understand the part of me...</font>

384
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,170
<font color="yellow">that neither my wife...</font>

385
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,610
<font color="yellow">nor my friends understand.</font>

386
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,540
<font color="yellow">It's hard to understand for people who are not us.</font>

387
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,110
<font color="yellow">They won't understand the life of a neurosurgeon.</font>

388
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,870
<font color="yellow">So you should treat me well.</font>

389
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,470
<font color="yellow">I am older than you, and I'm dying earlier than you.</font>

390
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,670
<font color="yellow">Thank you for what you did that time.</font>

391
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,140
<font color="yellow">You went against my father's wishes for me.</font>

392
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,970
<font color="yellow">Later...</font>

393
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,570
<font color="yellow">Later when I meet him again,</font>

394
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,170
<font color="yellow">I will ask for his forgiveness.</font>

395
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,560
<font color="yellow">Then he will probably say this.</font>

396
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,870
<font color="yellow">"You never listened to me. I knew this would happen."</font>

397
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh,</font>

398
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,740
<font color="yellow">why do I have to be worried about entering my own house?</font>

399
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, those beagles are driving me crazy.</font>

400
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,110
<font color="yellow">No. I will kick them out if they are there.</font>

401
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,710
<font color="yellow">I will show them how serious I am.</font>

402
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,240
<font color="yellow">They are not here.</font>

403
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,170
<font color="yellow">They aren't here.</font>

404
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

405
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,370
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

406
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,810
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

407
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,490
<font color="yellow">But they know the password.</font>

408
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,240
<font color="yellow">Beagles would never press the bell.</font>

409
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

410
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,970
<font color="yellow">You said you still love me like a sister. I'm not going home.</font>

411
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,540
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

412
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,740
<font color="yellow">I already feel like this isn't my home! This is...</font>

413
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,540
<font color="yellow">You're home early.</font>

414
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,740
<font color="yellow">We came late today to give you some alone time.</font>

415
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,710
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Seo Woo.
-  Hello.</font>

416
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,500
<font color="yellow">I've come to be a nuisance tonight.</font>

417
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're no nuisance.</font>

418
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,040
<font color="yellow">This is the haven for homeless people.</font>

419
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,120
<font color="yellow">Welcome to the haven, Seo Woo.</font>

420
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,140
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Uncle Pa Ran. Thank you, In Joo.</font>

421
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,940
<font color="yellow">Isn't this too much?</font>

422
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,890
<font color="yellow">I have this thing called privacy too.</font>

423
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,240
<font color="yellow">Uncle Pa Ran, let's not do this. Please take them with you.</font>

424
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,350
<font color="yellow">- You should leave.
-  Right.</font>

425
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,410
<font color="yellow">We will be comfortable here if you leave.</font>

426
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,330
<font color="yellow">What? But this is my place.</font>

427
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,110
<font color="yellow">Stop bragging that you own a house.</font>

428
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,510
<font color="yellow">I am not so sad since I own a house of my own too.</font>

429
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,210
<font color="yellow">I will leave.</font>

430
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,740
<font color="yellow">I hope you live happily.</font>

431
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,140
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know Ji Hong's door lock password?</font>

432
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,610
<font color="yellow">Do you have it?</font>

433
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,710
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

434
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,970
<font color="yellow">You're here. I got kicked out from my place.</font>

435
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:02,500
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that your place though? – Fist came first before law.</font>

436
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,240
<font color="yellow">Still, how can you break into my place? Gosh!</font>

437
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,140
<font color="yellow">Do you think that will make me go up again?</font>

438
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,240
<font color="yellow">I rather be beaten to death here...</font>

439
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,770
<font color="yellow">than sleep in the same house with those beagles.</font>

440
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't try opening your fridge.</font>

441
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,640
<font color="yellow">I thought we weren't that close yet.</font>

442
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,340
<font color="yellow">We're not close enough,</font>

443
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,870
<font color="yellow">and yet you're trying to sleep in my place.</font>

444
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,300
<font color="yellow">We can get close now.</font>

445
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,610
<font color="yellow">You are the only human in this building.</font>

446
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,710
<font color="yellow">We humans should get along well.</font>

447
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,370
<font color="yellow">I will open the fridge then.</font>

448
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,010
<font color="yellow">Would you like anything?</font>

449
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,340
<font color="yellow">Bring out some beers.</font>

450
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,770
<font color="yellow">What are you? A teenager? Why did you leave home?</font>

451
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,910
<font color="yellow">- How is it for you?
-  What do you mean?</font>

452
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,010
<font color="yellow">Living in general.</font>

453
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,740
<font color="yellow">Do you ask how to live before you live life?</font>

454
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,710

<font color="yellow">I'll sleep a little later.</font>

-  This is too much.</font>

486

497
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,410

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,240

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,210
<font color="yellow">- Did you take an X-ray?
-  Yes.</font>

521
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,240
<font color="yellow">But the patient is pregnant.</font>

522
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,010
<font color="yellow">- Did you call Gynaecology?
-  They'll be here soon.</font>

-  I don't think you should do it.</font>

00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,640
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

606
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,910
<font color="yellow">It's the same result whether you operate on her or not.</font>

607
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,410
<font color="yellow">It isn't the same.</font>

608
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,960
<font color="yellow">She has to fight through surgery. Why would put her through that?</font>

609
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,810
<font color="yellow">What if we decompress her brain so it isn't damaged any further?</font>

610
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,500
<font color="yellow">We can extend her life.</font>

611
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,300
<font color="yellow">She can't even breathe on her own.</font>

612
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,640
<font color="yellow">She might die during surgery along with the baby.</font>

613
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,870
<font color="yellow">But you never know.</font>

614
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,240
<font color="yellow">She might miraculously recover.</font>

615
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,870
<font color="yellow">You're getting rid of the chance...</font>

616
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,920
<font color="yellow">for that miracle to happen if you don't operate on her.</font>

617
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,220
<font color="yellow">Whom is this for?</font>

618
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,610
<font color="yellow">Give her guardian some time.</font>

619
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,710
<font color="yellow">The possibility of his wife and baby's death must be a big shock.</font>

620
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,080
<font color="yellow">If you're hesitant about this surgery,</font>

621
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,740
<font color="yellow">may I do it?</font>

622
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,770
<font color="yellow">- Hye Jung.
-  I'll do it.</font>

623
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,460
<font color="yellow">I can do this.</font>

624
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,580
<font color="yellow">You're overstepping your bounds as a fellow.</font>

625
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,810
<font color="yellow">If you're doing this because of our relationship...</font>

626
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,210
<font color="yellow">Had it been the case, I wouldn't have been able to do this.</font>

627
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,010
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you that I think...</font>

628
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,890
<font color="yellow">as a doctor.</font>

629
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,110
<font color="yellow">Then go strengthen your argument before you try to persuade me.</font>

630
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,510
<font color="yellow">What if I'm the patient?</font>

631
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,670
<font color="yellow">Will you give up?</font>

632
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,470
<font color="yellow">That's not fair.</font>

633
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,940
<font color="yellow">You're not persuading me as a doctor.</font>

634
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my back.</font>

635
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,140
<font color="yellow">Hello, President Jin.</font>

636
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,340
<font color="yellow">Mr Congressman, what happened?</font>

637
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,080
<font color="yellow">I hurt my back while playing golf.</font>

638
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,440
<font color="yellow">So it happened because you're still full of energy.</font>

639
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,110
<font color="yellow">It proves that you're still youthful.</font>

640
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh, not at all.</font>

641
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,040
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of me.</font>

642
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,240
<font color="yellow">Of course. I can do anything for you.</font>

643
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,230
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

644
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,110
<font color="yellow">Who will look after me during my stay here?</font>

645
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,680
<font color="yellow">Let's go in first.</font>

646
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,370
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's go. Gosh.</font>

647
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,010
<font color="yellow">Hello, Prof. Hong.</font>

648
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,640
<font color="yellow">I called you because Congressman Nam here wants you to be his doctor.</font>

649
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,190
<font color="yellow">I'm Prof. Hong Ji Hong of Neurosurgery.</font>

650
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,240
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong, don't you remember me?</font>

651
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,870
<font color="yellow">I couldn't make it to your father's funeral,</font>

652
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,510
<font color="yellow">but I paid my condolences.</font>

653
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,930
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

654
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,310
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. I watched the video clip about the archer, Lee Soo Jeong.</font>

655
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I was so fascinated and impressed by it.</font>

656
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,540
<font color="yellow">He's the most famous surgeon at our hospital.</font>

657
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,510
<font color="yellow">Please come in!</font>

658
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,410
<font color="yellow">I finally get to meet you in person.</font>

659
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,140
<font color="yellow">I'm a fan of yours.</font>

660
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

661
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,850
<font color="yellow">I called you because Congressman Nam wanted to meet you in person.</font>

662
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,580
<font color="yellow">I like people who appear on television.</font>

663
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,110
<font color="yellow">I heard you can fight like a gangster.</font>

664
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:35,170
<font color="yellow">I heard that you hurt your lower back.</font>

665
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:38,170
<font color="yellow">Yes, while playing golf. I'm in so much pain.</font>

666
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,340
<font color="yellow">I'll take a look and see exactly where the pain is coming from.</font>

667
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,840
<font color="yellow">- All right.
-  Please lie down.</font>

668
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,810
<font color="yellow">- Please lie on your side.
-  Okay.</font>

669
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,670
<font color="yellow">Please raise your left leg.</font>

670
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,180
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't do it.</font>

671
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,730
<font color="yellow">I'll try lifting it for you.</font>

672
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,210
<font color="yellow">- Please let me know if it hurts.
-  Okay.</font>

673
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,540
<font color="yellow">All right. We'll stop there.</font>

674
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,210
<font color="yellow">The ligaments seem to have been injured,</font>

675
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:04,810
<font color="yellow">and you might have a herniated disc.</font>

676
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,810
<font color="yellow">We'll do a MRI scan and find out exactly what's going on.</font>

677
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,710
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo, let me know when his MRI scan is done.</font>

678
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,340
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

679
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,310
<font color="yellow">Do you still think that you're right about the surgery?</font>

680
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,940
<font color="yellow">Yes. What about you?</font>

681
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,940
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

682
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,070
<font color="yellow">Doors are opening.</font>

683
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,040
<font color="yellow">Doors are closing.</font>

684
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,510
<font color="yellow">Kyung Joon.</font>

685
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,110
<font color="yellow">Is Patient Lee Hye Young in the intensive care unit now?</font>

686
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,340
<font color="yellow">That patient who arrived in her wedding dress, right?</font>

687
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:13,340
<font color="yellow">She's still in the emergency room as the ICU is full.</font>

688
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,910
<font color="yellow">We'll move her there as soon as we can.</font>

689
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:18,470
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

690
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,210
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

691
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,970
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to live...</font>

692
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,970
<font color="yellow">if I have to send her without being able to do anything for her.</font>

693
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,240
<font color="yellow">If we could...</font>

694
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,340
<font color="yellow">extend her life by just 10 minutes...</font>

695
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,040
<font color="yellow">If she can live for another 10 minutes...</font>

696
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,310
<font color="yellow">to spend more time with our baby inside her...</font>

697
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,910
<font color="yellow">I want to do anything and everything for her.</font>

698
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,040
<font color="yellow">Bring the defibrillator.</font>

699
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,210
<font color="yellow">Chairman Hong has signed the DNR confirmation form.</font>

700
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,410
<font color="yellow">Bring it!</font>

701
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,970
<font color="yellow">That's not what Chairman Hong wants.</font>

702
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,910
<font color="yellow">I might not be able to wake up because of my age.</font>

703
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,870
<font color="yellow">I do not want to be forced into being resuscitated.</font>

704
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,040
<font color="yellow">It's arrest.</font>

705
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,110
<font color="yellow">Please bring the defibrillator.</font>

706
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,640
<font color="yellow">(Restricted Zone)</font>

707
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,810
<font color="yellow">Please give me the gown.</font>

708
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,470
<font color="yellow">I opened the dura mater for you.</font>

709
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,540
<font color="yellow">Gynaecology, keep monitoring the foetus.</font>

710
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Professor.
-  The microscope, please.</font>

711
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,410
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

712
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:29,740
<font color="yellow">Cottonoid.</font>

713
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,310
<font color="yellow">The foetus' heart rate is dropping.</font>

714
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,740
<font color="yellow">We're almost there. I just need to cut the draining vein.</font>

715
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,240
<font color="yellow">Microsurgical scissors.</font>

716
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,040
<font color="yellow">Bipolar forceps.</font>

717
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,310
<font color="yellow">It keeps dropping. We have to close it up as soon as possible.</font>

718
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,810
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it so late?</font>

719
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:16,440
<font color="yellow">I did?</font>

720
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,170
<font color="yellow">No, you did a good job.</font>

721
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:20,970
<font color="yellow">Did you check Patient Lee Change Je's mental status?</font>

722
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,870
<font color="yellow">That's Kang Soo's job.</font>

723
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,300
<font color="yellow">I'm in my second year, you know.</font>

724
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,740
<font color="yellow">There's no need to divide tasks amongst you two.</font>

725
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,370
<font color="yellow">We should divide the tasks. You're right.</font>

726
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,610
<font color="yellow">Yes. Thank you.</font>

727
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,310
<font color="yellow">Are you two chatting away again?</font>

728
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,230
<font color="yellow">He thinks we're slacking off whenever he sees us talking.</font>

729
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:41,700
<font color="yellow">What are you grumbling about now?</font>

730
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,000
<font color="yellow">- Nothing.
-  Nothing.</font>

731
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,500
<font color="yellow">- Ahn Joong Dae.
-  Yes.</font>

732
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,040
<font color="yellow">How can you run away when you're in your second year?</font>

733
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,370
<font color="yellow">You must set an example for first-year residents.</font>

734
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,440
<font color="yellow">- Kyung Joon.
-  Yes.</font>

735
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,690
<font color="yellow">You must pick on him a lot.</font>

736
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,370
<font color="yellow">What will you do if he runs away again because of you?</font>

737
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,870
<font color="yellow">Even if I bully him, it's nothing compared to...</font>

738
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:55,940
<font color="yellow">how you bully me.</font>

739
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,540
<font color="yellow">- What?
-  Doctor.</font>

740
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,640
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong once bought us a night snack.</font>

741
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that to me?</font>

742
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,220
<font color="yellow">I know. Why did I suddenly think of that?</font>

743
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,370
<font color="yellow">I don't understand myself either.</font>

744
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,970
<font color="yellow">He ordered steamed seafood dish, and we really enjoyed it.</font>

745
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,010
<font color="yellow">Right? I love you at times like this, Joong Dae.</font>

746
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,050
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come into my heart?</font>

747
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,370
<font color="yellow">You brats.</font>

748
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,340
<font color="yellow">Express yourself clearly. What are you trying to say?</font>

749
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,280
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong has his own rules, and I have my own.</font>

750
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,010
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go check on Mr Lee Chang Je?</font>

751
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,040
<font color="yellow">- Would you like to?
-  Let's go.</font>

752
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,170
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

753
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,810
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

754
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,670
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

755
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,640

764
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,370
<font color="yellow">But the damage was too big from the start.</font>

765
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,310
<font color="yellow">And she's not responding at all.</font>

766

<font color="yellow">- But the surgery went well, right?
-  Yes.</font>

767
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,310
<font color="yellow">Then she can wake up later. She can get better, right?</font>

768
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,310
<font color="yellow">We can't promise anything.</font>

769

<font color="yellow">How about the baby? Is he all right?</font>

770
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,210
<font color="yellow">The baby is healthy.</font>

771

<font color="yellow">His heart beats well,</font>

772
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,370

00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:38,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

778
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

779
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,210
<font color="yellow">Why did you suddenly decide to have the operation?</font>

780
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,970
<font color="yellow">I realised that I might stop the chance of a miracle happening.</font>

781
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,010

782
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,040

<font color="yellow">nearly in coma.</font>

793
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,610
<font color="yellow">Soon, her other organs will slowly stop working.</font>

794

<font color="yellow">What choice?</font>

00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,640
<font color="yellow">What choice am I to make?</font>

799
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,770
<font color="yellow">Your wife won't be waking up.</font>
