<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

4
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:25,878
<font color="yellow">Yeah, what is it?
I need to get back inside quickly.</font>

5
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,544
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

6
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:30,710
<font color="yellow">It's not under my name,
but another person's name.</font>

7
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:32,952
<font color="yellow">Did you sell the house?</font>

8
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:34,325
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

9
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,690
<font color="yellow">You're pretty quick for a young kid.</font>

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,983
<font color="yellow">Have you been looking at that
this whole time?</font>

11
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,212
<font color="yellow">It's my house.</font>

12
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,401
<font color="yellow">The house I lived in
with my mom and dad.</font>

13
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:45,221
<font color="yellow">I'm your guardian.</font>

14
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:47,127
<font color="yellow">You should repay your debts now.</font>

15
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:51,345
<font color="yellow">I took care of you for a year
after your mom and dad died.</font>

16
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:54,121
<font color="yellow">I've taken better care of you
than my own children.</font>

17
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,678
<font color="yellow">I've done more than enough for you.</font>

18
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,323
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

19
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:16,591
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong!</font>

20
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:25,243
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about you lately,
so I asked around at the orphanage.</font>

21
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:28,809
<font color="yellow">You became a doctor.</font>

22
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,785
<font color="yellow">Se Joon, who's in heaven,
would have been happy to hear it too.</font>

23
00:01:33,486 --> 00:01:35,088
<font color="yellow">What brings you by?</font>

24
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,505
<font color="yellow">I'm getting dialysis for my kidneys.</font>

25
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:42,416
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

26
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,085
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

27
00:01:45,966 --> 00:01:48,172
<font color="yellow">I feel better now that I've seen you.</font>

28
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:52,799
<font color="yellow">I knew that you'd be blessed like this.</font>

29
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:06,555
<font color="yellow"><i>I had dreamed of getting revenge.</i></font>

30
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:09,458
<font color="yellow"><i>I had wanted everyone to die
and I wanted to die too.</i></font>

31
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:13,325
<font color="yellow"><i>Karma exists in this world.</i></font>

32
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:17,534
<font color="yellow"><i>I am not the center of karma.
It's the world that is.</i></font>

33
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,522
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

34
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,399
<font color="yellow">There was some time between when your
father passed out and when he was found.</font>

35
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,702
<font color="yellow">Isn't is strange to you? I think it is.</font>

36
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,013
<font color="yellow">There's something there.</font>

37
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,113
<font color="yellow">Have you looked into it?</font>

38
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,792
<font color="yellow">I did. It wasn't much.</font>

39
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:43,226
<font color="yellow">It was nagging at me too.</font>

40
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:44,935
<font color="yellow">But I'm not going to fall into that.</font>

41
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:50,349
<font color="yellow">I'm not giving up on eating,
being with you, or being with patients.</font>

42
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:53,210
<font color="yellow">I know that's what my dad wants too.</font>

43
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,791
<font color="yellow">How do you know what he wants?</font>

44
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,325
<font color="yellow">Except for the odd cases</font>

45
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:58,768
<font color="yellow">all parents want
happiness for their kids.</font>

46
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:02,899
<font color="yellow">Revenge, destruction, punishment...
I don't get caught up in that stuff.</font>

47
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,434
<font color="yellow">Time is precious just doing
the things I love doing today.</font>

48
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:10,502
<font color="yellow">To me, there is no tomorrow.</font>

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,363
<font color="yellow">Please just leave.</font>

50
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,263
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about
these things with you again.</font>

51
00:03:23,714 --> 00:03:26,583
<font color="yellow">We're only seeing things
from our own points of view.</font>

52
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,385
<font color="yellow">I think we should stop that.</font>

53
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,087
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he getting up?</font>

54
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:03,942
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

55
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,207
<font color="yellow">Is he up?</font>

56
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,613
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

57
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,911
<font color="yellow">He must be catching up on
all the sleep he was lacking.</font>

58
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:13,447
<font color="yellow">He's awake!</font>

59
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:16,884
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo! Can you see us?</font>

60
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,339
<font color="yellow">That sounds like the chief's voice.</font>

61
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,635
<font color="yellow">Can you not see us?</font>

62
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,236
<font color="yellow">Section Chief.</font>

63
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,091
<font color="yellow">Your tie color looks great.</font>

64
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:36,575
<font color="yellow">You punk! You really scared me.</font>

65
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,476
<font color="yellow">Your yelling is what's scary.</font>

66
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:40,750
<font color="yellow">Does your head hurt?</font>

67
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,009
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

68
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,178
<font color="yellow">Good, then.</font>

69
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,445
<font color="yellow">- Let Professor Hong Ji Hong know.
- Okay.</font>

70
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:51,327
<font color="yellow">Section Chief is so cool.</font>

71
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,798
<font color="yellow">"Good, then."</font>

72
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,584
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo is sleeping again.</font>

73
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,860
<font color="yellow">Let's get going.</font>

74
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:31,283
<font color="yellow">Even if you pursue this case,
the statute of limitations has passed.</font>

75
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:32,789
<font color="yellow">I made a mistake.</font>

76
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:35,426
<font color="yellow">However, I did my best.</font>

77
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:38,464
<font color="yellow">So, I have no reason
to be punished by you.</font>

78
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:40,685
<font color="yellow">But I will apologize.</font>

79
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,995
<font color="yellow">Mistakes are wrong too.</font>

80
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:46,695
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you falling
into this and ruining your life.</font>

81
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:27,041
<font color="yellow">Director Jin.</font>

82
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:31,031
<font color="yellow">You finished golfing already?</font>

83
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:32,110
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

84
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,825
<font color="yellow">You can all stay here.</font>

85
00:06:42,606 --> 00:06:45,087
<font color="yellow">I've been contacting
all of the board members.</font>

86
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,978
<font color="yellow">Half of them are on our side.</font>

87
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:50,194
<font color="yellow">Half is not enough.
I've been contacting them too.</font>

88
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,582
<font color="yellow">I have to get the Senior Health Center
passed at the next board meeting.</font>

89
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,521
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about Ji Hong?</font>

90
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:58,551
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep him around?</font>

91
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,252
<font color="yellow">I suppose you have to keep him.</font>

92
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,622
<font color="yellow">People have a lot of trust in
Ji Hong because of Doo Shik.</font>

93
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,993
<font color="yellow">Also, he's done nothing problematic.</font>

94
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,440
<font color="yellow">I can always come up with
a reason to get rid of him.</font>

95
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,452
<font color="yellow">Like what?</font>

96
00:07:10,452 --> 00:07:12,221
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

97
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:14,781
<font color="yellow">I just need you to persuade
all of the board members.</font>

98
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,180
<font color="yellow">We need two-thirds of them
to be on our side.</font>

99
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,200
<font color="yellow">Who has Professor Kim Tae Ho
been meeting with lately?</font>

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
<font color="yellow">He's been in touch with
the people from MH Meditech.</font>

101
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,200
<font color="yellow">What's Professor Hong Ji Hong up to?</font>

102
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,726
<font color="yellow">The hospital, dating,
and meeting Professor Kim Tae Ho.</font>

103
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,979
<font color="yellow"><i>[Yoo Hye Jung]</i></font>

104
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:39,986
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

105
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:41,664
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

106
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:42,846
<font color="yellow">What can I do for you?</font>

107
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,257
<font color="yellow">I would like to meet with you.</font>

108
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:46,098
<font color="yellow">I thought we had finished talking.</font>

109
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,217
<font color="yellow">I have something new to discuss.</font>

110
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:50,587
<font color="yellow">When are you free?</font>

111
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,341
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's that you're wearing?
Get changed so that we can go.</font>

112
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,027
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. Go with Doctor Hong.</font>

113
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,887
<font color="yellow">Just give me some coffee.</font>

114
00:08:09,116 --> 00:08:12,166
<font color="yellow">I haven't been bothering Ji Hong.
Doctor Yoo is going through a lot.</font>

115
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,163
<font color="yellow">He's focused on her right now.</font>

116
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,428
<font color="yellow">What's going on with her?</font>

117
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,217
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo had been looking into
her grandma's medical accident.</font>

118
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:19,719
<font color="yellow">I guess she found something.</font>

119
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,351
<font color="yellow">She brought the anesthesiology records
and asked me about it.</font>

120
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:26,705
<font color="yellow">Then, was that the thing you guys
had to talk about in secret before?</font>

121
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:28,140
<font color="yellow">You still remember that?</font>

122
00:08:28,142 --> 00:08:31,604
<font color="yellow">Of course I do.
All of my thoughts are on her.</font>

123
00:08:32,853 --> 00:08:35,422
<font color="yellow">You can think, but don't act.</font>

124
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:37,304
<font color="yellow">What if I say I can't do that?</font>

125
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:40,502
<font color="yellow">I can't stop you,
but I can't be on your side.</font>

126
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:43,123
<font color="yellow">So, who made the surgical error?</font>

127
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,838
<font color="yellow">Director Jin Myung Hoon.</font>

128
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,482
<font color="yellow">It's something very close to our family.</font>

129
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,542
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved.</font>

130
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:54,963
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

131
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:58,825
<font color="yellow">Professor Jung Yoon Do is here.</font>

132
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,732
<font color="yellow">Oh, come in. Sit down.</font>

133
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:09,232
<font color="yellow">What brings you to my office?</font>

134
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,944
<font color="yellow">Is your offer for me to become a
board member still good?</font>

135
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:14,795
<font color="yellow">You are always welcome.</font>

136
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,632
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Okay.</font>

137
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:18,175
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at the board meeting.</font>

138
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,612
<font color="yellow">We'll be voting on the
Senior Health Center.</font>

139
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,432
<font color="yellow">You just need to vote yes.</font>

140
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:35,619
<font color="yellow"><i>Do not come again regarding this issue.</i></font>

141
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:38,575
<font color="yellow">It would be even better if you didn't
come back to the hospital at all.</font>

142
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,454
<font color="yellow"><i>[Jung Yoon Do]</i></font>

143
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:54,741
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

144
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,932
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
No, let me take a guess.</font>

145
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,302
<font color="yellow">You're exercising, right?</font>

146
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:02,694
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I have to talk to you.</font>

147
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:06,089
<font color="yellow">Let's meet. I'll go where you are.
Where do you want to meet?</font>

148
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:08,671
<font color="yellow">There's no need for you to come.
I'm going to the hospital later.</font>

149
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:09,925
<font color="yellow">I want to visit Kang Soo too.</font>

150
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,177
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

151
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,002
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, how are you?</font>

152
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,374
<font color="yellow">My head hurts a bit but it's manageable.</font>

153
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:31,124
<font color="yellow">- You can present.
- Okay.</font>

154
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,800
<font color="yellow">27-year-old male
in an alert mental state.</font>

155
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,949
<font color="yellow">Besides the pain in the surgery location</font>

156
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,717
<font color="yellow">my right lower limbs,
sensation of touch, movement...</font>

157
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,041
<font color="yellow">everything is okay.</font>

158
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:51,805
<font color="yellow">I think the fine motor function of
my right hand is slightly affected.</font>

159
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,513
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

160
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:55,531
<font color="yellow">Lift it up.</font>

161
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,911
<font color="yellow">Put it down and lift it again.</font>

162
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,451
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let me see the other side.</font>

163
00:11:04,352 --> 00:11:05,492
<font color="yellow">Lift up.</font>

164
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:09,369
<font color="yellow">Relax and lift up again.</font>

165
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:13,393
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let me see your pupils.</font>

166
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:21,637
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong.</font>

167
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,158
<font color="yellow">Can I be a surgeon again?</font>

168
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,964
<font color="yellow">You can.</font>

169
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,112
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

170
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,348
<font color="yellow">Your face looked so happy
when he said that.</font>

171
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,419
<font color="yellow">Not right away.</font>

172
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:38,593
<font color="yellow">We need to keep an eye on you
and make sure nothing goes wrong.</font>

173
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:40,307
<font color="yellow">You'll need to take some time off.</font>

174
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:42,652
<font color="yellow">- Take time off?
- Yes.</font>

175
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,291
<font color="yellow">Let's get him into a room.</font>

176
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,512
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Use Ceftriaxone for one more day.</font>

177
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:50,892
<font color="yellow">Give him 500 milligrams of
painkillers twice a day.</font>

178
00:11:50,892 --> 00:11:52,222
<font color="yellow">Rest up.</font>

179
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,296
<font color="yellow">- See you in a bit.
- Okay.</font>

180
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,862
<font color="yellow">About Kang Soo...</font>

181
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,400
<font color="yellow">- What about Kang Soo?
- He has nowhere to go.</font>

182
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,484
<font color="yellow">He didn't get a place when
he became a resident here.</font>

183
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,753
<font color="yellow">His brother is in the army,
so he didn't need a place.</font>

184
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,911
<font color="yellow">Good thing I ran into you.
I was about to go find you.</font>

185
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:26,152
<font color="yellow">I found out who it was that leaked
the news about your father's stocks.</font>

186
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:35,393
<font color="yellow">I had a feeling it was him,
but I was hoping it wasn't.</font>

187
00:12:35,393 --> 00:12:39,369
<font color="yellow">How could he hurt the hospital
just so he could be better off?</font>

188
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:42,410
<font color="yellow">He would do anything to put
himself in a better position.</font>

189
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:48,060
<font color="yellow">The reporter told me that he obviously
leaked it to make the public upset.</font>

190
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,616
<font color="yellow">About Dad and Director Jin Sung Jong...</font>

191
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:54,451
<font color="yellow">I think something happened
between them before he died.</font>

192
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:57,708
<font color="yellow">I felt like something was off
and I had been looking into it.</font>

193
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,315
<font color="yellow">Take a look at this.</font>

194
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:14,651
<font color="yellow">Director Jin was in the VIP room
for about 20 minutes.</font>

195
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:15,761
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

196
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,892
<font color="yellow">If you consider the time my dad
passed out and was alone</font>

197
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:23,708
<font color="yellow">I think he passed out
right after Director Jin left.</font>

198
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,959
<font color="yellow">Director Jin Myung Hoon
had agreed to step down.</font>

199
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:28,730
<font color="yellow">He isn't someone who
would agree to do that.</font>

200
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,232
<font color="yellow">I think your father
had something on them.</font>

201
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,374
<font color="yellow">What could that be?</font>

202
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,142
<font color="yellow">They have plenty of weaknesses.</font>

203
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,369
<font color="yellow">Which one is the most fatal?</font>

204
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:43,129
<font color="yellow">What do you think it is, Doctor?</font>

205
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,920
<font color="yellow">The off-site facilities for the hospital
are operated by Director Jin Myung Hoon.</font>

206
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,924
<font color="yellow">What about them?</font>

207
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:51,789
<font color="yellow">Does all the revenue from those
facilities go back into the hospital?</font>

208
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,969
<font color="yellow">I'm sure some goes back
into the director's pockets</font>

209
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:56,290
<font color="yellow">and that's embezzlement.</font>

210
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,636
<font color="yellow">That's not something
to be so scared about.</font>

211
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,186
<font color="yellow">Is that really a fatal weakness?</font>

212
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:04,824
<font color="yellow">I'll focus on that for now
and look into it.</font>

213
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,387
<font color="yellow">Okay. Oh, and Kang Soo...</font>

214
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:08,522
<font color="yellow">What about Kang Soo?</font>

215
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,581
<font color="yellow">Apparently he has nowhere to go.</font>

216
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:15,127
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

217
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:18,464
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

218
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:21,777
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't do that now. It's gross.</font>

219
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,454
<font color="yellow">- Let me hug you.
- Seriously?</font>

220
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:28,513
<font color="yellow">What kind of guy are you?</font>

221
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:30,874
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die earlier.</font>

222
00:14:30,874 --> 00:14:33,735
<font color="yellow">They only let you visit
twice a day in the ICU.</font>

223
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,480
<font color="yellow">And only 30 minutes at a time.</font>

224
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,584
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

225
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:39,494
<font color="yellow">Did you eat?</font>

226
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,244
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't. I wanted to eat with you.</font>

227
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,012
<font color="yellow">I'm going to steal all your food.</font>

228
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,700
<font color="yellow">All right. You can eat it all, you pig.</font>

229
00:14:58,892 --> 00:14:59,943
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes?</i></font>

230
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,018
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

231
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,140
<font color="yellow">Let's hear what you have to say.</font>

232
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,469
<font color="yellow">I looked into some things after we spoke.</font>

233
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:20,220
<font color="yellow">I looked into legal action I could take
regarding my grandmother.</font>

234
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,392
<font color="yellow">You found something?</font>

235
00:15:21,392 --> 00:15:22,628
<font color="yellow">There was nothing.</font>

236
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,705
<font color="yellow">So, I found another way.</font>

237
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:32,259
<font color="yellow">I'm... going to kill you.</font>

238
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:37,746
<font color="yellow">Even if I can't kill you myself,
I'll make you wither away and die.</font>

239
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,265
<font color="yellow">I won't ever leave your side.</font>

240
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,488
<font color="yellow">I'll keep my eye on you
to see what happens to you.</font>

241
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,459
<font color="yellow">Keep watching.
You'll only get angrier.</font>

242
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,522
<font color="yellow">I'll be there to get at you
whenever an opportunity arises.</font>

243
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,435
<font color="yellow">You want to know why
I'm telling you in advance?</font>

244
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:55,845
<font color="yellow">I don't usually hide when I take action.
I do it in the open.</font>

245
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,320
<font color="yellow">It's all over if I fire you.</font>

246
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
<font color="yellow">Fire me.</font>

247
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,241
<font color="yellow">Then I'll use the law
that you like so much.</font>

248
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:03,708
<font color="yellow">I'll sue you for unfair dismissal.</font>

249
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:07,485
<font color="yellow">I became kind of famous, thanks to you.</font>

250
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,124
<font color="yellow">People think we're on good terms.</font>

251
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:12,363
<font color="yellow">That's what regular people think.</font>

252
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:16,802
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't firing me
cause a problem for you?</font>

253
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:21,358
<font color="yellow">I'll be back once my suspension is over
and I'll stay here until the very end.</font>

254
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:24,968
<font color="yellow">When you're destroyed...</font>

255
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:27,748
<font color="yellow">I'll be here to watch it.</font>

256
00:16:29,026 --> 00:16:30,773
<font color="yellow">Are you threatening me?</font>

257
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,757
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

258
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:34,006
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

259
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,478
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

260
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:37,508
<font color="yellow">I want to scare you even more.</font>

261
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,055
<font color="yellow">Look forward to it.</font>

262
00:17:25,594 --> 00:17:28,805
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director Choi Tae Hyun]</i></font>

263
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:30,782
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director.</font>

264
00:17:30,782 --> 00:17:33,034
<font color="yellow">Why does Doctor Yoo have to punished?</font>

265
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:34,640
<font color="yellow">It was Doctor Jin
who didn't take the call.</font>

266
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,235
<font color="yellow">She's the director's daughter.</font>

267
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:40,075
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.
We low-born people should cry.</font>

268
00:17:43,183 --> 00:17:45,544
<font color="yellow">- You were here, Doctor?
- Yes.</font>

269
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,731
<font color="yellow">I don't think she heard us.</font>

270
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:54,594
<font color="yellow">Yeah, she would say something
if she heard us.</font>

271
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,382
<font color="yellow">Young Gook!</font>

272
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:12,430
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

273
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:14,971
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

274
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,638
<font color="yellow">I have something to ask.</font>

275
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,317
<font color="yellow">Are people talking behind my back?</font>

276
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:21,621
<font color="yellow">Why? Did someone say something?</font>

277
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:22,621
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

278
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:25,984
<font color="yellow">It's because of the discipline thing.
People aren't happy about that.</font>

279
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:27,814
<font color="yellow">You are the director's daughter.</font>

280
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:32,350
<font color="yellow">By the way, I thought the
director liked Doctor Yoo.</font>

281
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,341
<font color="yellow">Why did he suddenly change his stance?</font>

282
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,672
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

283
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:45,360
<font color="yellow">My daughter is here?
I didn't even call for you.</font>

284
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,950
<font color="yellow">I was curious about something.</font>

285
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,081
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

286
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,299
<font color="yellow">Why did you punish Hye Jung?
You liked her, didn't you?</font>

287
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,141
<font color="yellow">I'm just following the hospital rules.
Personal feelings have no place in it.</font>

288
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:02,350
<font color="yellow">You said I should take part
in hospital management.</font>

289
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,780
<font color="yellow">You leave me out of
simple matters like this.</font>

290
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,190
<font color="yellow">How are you going tell me about
important things in the future?</font>

291
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,895
<font color="yellow">This is a complex matter.</font>

292
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,068
<font color="yellow">It isn't simple.</font>

293
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,198
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

294
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,919
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm just glad to see you
taking an interest in the hospital.</font>

295
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,302
<font color="yellow">This is a good start.</font>

296
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,442
<font color="yellow"><i>[Mom]</i></font>

297
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:24,635
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mom.</font>

298
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,646
<font color="yellow">You're meeting a
potential suitor this Saturday.</font>

299
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,043

300
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:30,912
<font color="yellow">- Mom!
- Don't talk like that.</font>

00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:34,634
<font color="yellow">You only manage to get anywhere
if I help you out.</font>

302
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,082
<font color="yellow">Since when?</font>

303
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:38,021
<font color="yellow"><i>Who made you who you are today?</i></font>

304
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:39,190
<font color="yellow">It was me.</font>

305
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,904
<font color="yellow">If I left it up to you</font>

306
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,131
<font color="yellow">you wouldn't get married
until you were 40.</font>

307
00:19:45,796 --> 00:19:47,690
<font color="yellow">You're going on a date
with a potential suitor?</font>

308
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,622
<font color="yellow">She should have done this earlier.</font>

309
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,940
<font color="yellow">Now, she's finally doing her part.</font>

310
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,600
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

311
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,283
<font color="yellow">I met Director Jin and I dropped by.</font>

312
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:06,642
<font color="yellow">It's my room too.</font>

313
00:20:06,642 --> 00:20:08,892
<font color="yellow">You met my dad? Why?</font>

314
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,373
<font color="yellow">- I had to discuss something.
- What was it?</font>

315
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,400
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to
explain it all to you.</font>

316
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:26,680
<font color="yellow">- Kang Soo's in his room, right?
- Yes.</font>

317
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,755
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

318
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,305
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo!</font>

319
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:33,018
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Doctor Yoo.
- Yes.</font>

320
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:34,986
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

321
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:36,834
<font color="yellow">What's with you? You're happy to see me?</font>

322
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,472
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I'd live to see the day.</font>

323
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,384
<font color="yellow">- Did you come to see Kang Soo?
- Yes.</font>

324
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,869
<font color="yellow">We're going to see him now. Let's go.</font>

325
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,038
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Let's go.</font>

326
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:46,282
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

327
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,401
<font color="yellow">He's sleeping.</font>

328
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:56,729
<font color="yellow">He is.</font>

329
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,390
<font color="yellow">Gosh! You scared me.</font>

330
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,582
<font color="yellow">I'm not sleeping.</font>

331
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,473
<font color="yellow">Did you hear us?</font>

332
00:21:03,264 --> 00:21:05,299
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

333
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,604
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

334
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:09,373
<font color="yellow">You rejected me and got surgery
from Professor Hong Ji Hong.</font>

335
00:21:09,373 --> 00:21:10,946
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

336
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:14,834
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry to you too, Doctor Yoo.</font>

337
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,543
<font color="yellow">You got suspended because of me.</font>

338
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,153
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better?</font>

339
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:21,165
<font color="yellow">I'm in as much pain as
someone who's had surgery.</font>

340
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,642
<font color="yellow">You still speak well.</font>

341
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:25,720
<font color="yellow">I have to. I'm unemployed now.</font>

342
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,144
<font color="yellow">I can't use my strength.
Maybe I'll look into a teaching academy.</font>

343
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:31,774
<font color="yellow">I can talk pretty well.</font>

344
00:21:32,473 --> 00:21:34,023
<font color="yellow">You got much better.</font>

345
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:35,351
<font color="yellow">So much that you're surprised?</font>

346
00:21:41,777 --> 00:21:42,979
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo!</font>

347
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,779
<font color="yellow">Do you have some time?</font>

348
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:57,351
<font color="yellow">What did you want to talk about?</font>

349
00:22:00,784 --> 00:22:02,643
<font color="yellow">I met Director Jin earlier today.</font>

350
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:06,734
<font color="yellow">He offered me a board member position
and I took up the offer.</font>

351
00:22:07,373 --> 00:22:08,526
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

352
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,434
<font color="yellow">To help you, Doctor Yoo.</font>

353
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,006
<font color="yellow">Help me with what?</font>

354
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:16,073
<font color="yellow">I found out why you gave up
being a staff surgeon</font>

355
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:18,913
<font color="yellow">to come to this hospital instead.</font>

356
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:23,033
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'm behaving recklessly?</font>

357
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:24,649
<font color="yellow">It's not realistic.</font>

358
00:22:26,082 --> 00:22:27,928
<font color="yellow">That's your charm, Doctor Yoo.</font>

359
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:29,394
<font color="yellow">You're doing well with it.</font>

360
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,444
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat.</font>

361
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:35,180
<font color="yellow">I have to go in and see patients.</font>

362
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:48,894
<font color="yellow">Sir, please vote yes to the expansion
of the social welfare program.</font>

363
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,603
<font color="yellow">You're being so straight-forward
about asking me.</font>

364
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:54,278
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can say no.</font>

365
00:22:55,671 --> 00:22:57,052
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

366
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,312
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director Jin Myung Hoon]</i></font>

367
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,911
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director.</font>

368
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:10,231
<font color="yellow">Let's meet.</font>

369
00:23:10,819 --> 00:23:12,414
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit busy right now.</font>

370
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:15,890
<font color="yellow">Never mind, then.
It's regarding Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

371
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:32,392
<font color="yellow">You must be very busy.</font>

372
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:35,516
<font color="yellow">Being a doctor, boyfriend,
and a board member.</font>

373
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,979
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to you.</font>

374
00:23:37,979 --> 00:23:40,096
<font color="yellow">Regarding Doctor Yoo Hye Jung...</font>

375
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:42,419
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- She came to see me.</font>

376
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,289
<font color="yellow">She said she would kill me.</font>

377
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:49,227
<font color="yellow">With the way you acted,
it's no surprise she would get so angry.</font>

378
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,393
<font color="yellow">How could she be so ungrateful?</font>

379
00:23:51,393 --> 00:23:54,616
<font color="yellow">Who is she making a living off of?
Who helped make her famous?</font>

380
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:56,265
<font color="yellow">Yet, she wields a knife at me?</font>

381
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:58,225
<font color="yellow">Your words are a bit severe.</font>

382
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:05,612
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm... going to kill you.</i></font>

383
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:08,950
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you threatening me?</i></font>

384
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,564
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes.</i></font>

385
00:24:10,564 --> 00:24:11,623
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

386
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:12,981
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved.</font>

387
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:15,392
<font color="yellow">I want to scare you even more.</font>

388
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:16,847
<font color="yellow"><i>Look forward to it.</i></font>

389
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,853
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue her for threatening me.</font>

390
00:24:20,853 --> 00:24:22,931
<font color="yellow">That doesn't amount to a threat.</font>

391
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,578
<font color="yellow">There were no actions.
They were words said in anger.</font>

392
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:29,827
<font color="yellow">Professor Hong, this is why
people's pasts are important.</font>

393
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,837
<font color="yellow">A person's threats become something
more depending on who utters them.</font>

394
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:34,841
<font color="yellow">Get straight to the point.</font>

395
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:37,365
<font color="yellow">She had quite the life in high school.</font>

396
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,565
<font color="yellow">She got expelled by hurting
someone in a fire.</font>

397
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,787
<font color="yellow">She was transferred
many times for fighting.</font>

398
00:24:41,787 --> 00:24:45,816
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that is cool!
I really like people like that.</font>

399
00:24:47,136 --> 00:24:49,161
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want from me?</font>

400
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:51,499
<font color="yellow">You've been busy lately, so rest.</font>

401
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:54,372
<font color="yellow">Focus on the DBS dopamine sensor.</font>

402
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:57,034
<font color="yellow">Don't be a doctor. Live as a researcher.</font>

403
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:04,444
<font color="yellow">What if I say I can't do that?</font>

404
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:08,326
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung won't be able to
work in this field again.</font>

405
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:11,757
<font color="yellow">A neurosurgeon can't exactly
start her own business.</font>

406
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,911
<font color="yellow">Oh... Doctor.</font>

407
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:36,036
<font color="yellow">Were you at Soon Hee's restaurant?</font>

408
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,941
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was helping her with work.</font>

409
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,875
<font color="yellow">What brings you by?</font>

410
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,572
<font color="yellow">It's upsetting to hear you say that.</font>

411
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:43,822
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

412
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,988
<font color="yellow">We're allowed to drop by and
visit each other unannounced.</font>

413
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:49,200
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

414
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,989
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry at me?</font>

415
00:25:51,989 --> 00:25:53,337
<font color="yellow">Aren't you angry?</font>

416
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:55,930
<font color="yellow">I am. I'm not over it yet.</font>

417
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,941
<font color="yellow">I like your honesty.</font>

418
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:01,958
<font color="yellow">I was angry, but not anymore.</font>

419
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,631
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

420
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,860
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

421
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,674
<font color="yellow">"Just because" means that there's
a lot more meaning behind those words.</font>

422
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:11,534
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

423
00:26:13,111 --> 00:26:14,901
<font color="yellow">You saw Director Jin today, right?</font>

424
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,587
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

425
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:20,447
<font color="yellow">Are you going to lecture me again?</font>

426
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:22,757
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not. You did well.</font>

427
00:26:36,784 --> 00:26:38,574
<font color="yellow">Are you still angry?</font>

428
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:42,950
<font color="yellow">Yes... my feelings were so hurt.</font>

429
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:47,037
<font color="yellow">- Hye Jung.
- Yes?</font>

430
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:49,030
<font color="yellow">When did you wash your hair?</font>

431
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,068
<font color="yellow">- Does it smell?
- Yes.</font>

432
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,648
<font color="yellow">Oh no! I washed it today.</font>

433
00:26:54,366 --> 00:26:56,779
<font color="yellow">That's why it must smell so nice.</font>

434
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:59,918
<font color="yellow">Hey! What is that?
Why are you making fun of me?</font>

435
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:03,128
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to make you laugh.
I haven't seen you laugh in ages.</font>

436
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:07,620
<font color="yellow">Something is definitely strange.
I feel like something happened.</font>

437
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,996
<font color="yellow">It did.</font>

438
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:12,077
<font color="yellow">I'll be going to the DBS Research Center.</font>

439
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,271
<font color="yellow">What's going to change, then?</font>

440
00:27:14,271 --> 00:27:16,111
<font color="yellow">I won't be seeing patients.</font>

441
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:19,476
<font color="yellow">- I don't like that.
- Me neither.</font>

442
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:21,872
<font color="yellow">So why are you doing it?</font>

443
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,796
<font color="yellow">- By any chance--
- Do you know?</font>

444
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:29,215
<font color="yellow">Do you know what it's like to hate
something but also really want to do it?</font>

445
00:27:30,613 --> 00:27:33,551
<font color="yellow">I don't like complicated
things like that.</font>

446
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,403
<font color="yellow">I'll either do it or not.</font>

447
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,761
<font color="yellow">I'm going inside now.</font>

448
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,971
<font color="yellow">You're still angry.
You're still holding a grudge.</font>

449
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:03,760
<font color="yellow">If I didn't come to you today...</font>

450
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:08,519
<font color="yellow">I felt like you'd never
look at me again.</font>

451
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:22,947
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

452
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:26,149
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

453
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,477
<font color="yellow">Because I'm not good to you.</font>

454
00:28:28,477 --> 00:28:31,556
<font color="yellow">That's not true. You're very good to me.</font>

455
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,178
<font color="yellow">How am I?</font>

456
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:37,933
<font color="yellow">Remember what my dad said?
You're doing good just by sitting by me.</font>

457
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,274
<font color="yellow">You're sitting right here.</font>

458
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:44,114
<font color="yellow">I wish I could see
the board director now.</font>

459
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,334
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

460
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:50,893
<font color="yellow">But isn't it weird to call him
the board director?</font>

461
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:56,373
<font color="yellow">- Father?
- Yes.</font>

462
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:58,126
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

463
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:03,355
<font color="yellow">It would've been nice to call him that
when he was alive.</font>

464
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:06,744
<font color="yellow">You were good at everything,
but not that.</font>

465
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:11,692
<font color="yellow">Hey, you still refer to
my grandma as "Granny."</font>

466
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:15,882
<font color="yellow">Look, you just said sorry,
but you never want to lose.</font>

467
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:18,649
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

468
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,491
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, too.</font>

469
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:27,013
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

470
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:29,841
<font color="yellow">Because you're not happy.</font>

471
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:32,343
<font color="yellow">I say that I love you,
but I can't make you happy.</font>

472
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,499
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

473
00:29:35,884 --> 00:29:38,505
<font color="yellow">I've just never been happy before.</font>

474
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:42,354
<font color="yellow">I look for reasons to be unhappy
because I feel anxious when I'm happy.</font>

475
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:47,177
<font color="yellow">Can we overcome that somehow?</font>

476
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:50,190
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

477
00:29:51,144 --> 00:29:55,646
<font color="yellow">Maybe if we just keep going,
we will find out the answer.</font>

478
00:29:58,065 --> 00:30:00,515
<font color="yellow">Just don't forget that I'm by your side.</font>

479
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:05,556
<font color="yellow">How can I forget that?
You're my rock.</font>

480
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:54,686
<font color="yellow">Doctor, she has a fever.
Her whole body is hot.</font>

481
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,480
<font color="yellow">- Chart, please.
- Yes.</font>

482
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,711
<font color="yellow">- It's 39 degrees Celsius.
- That's very high.</font>

483
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,710
<font color="yellow">It's not good for the fetus.
Get cold saline and cooling pads.</font>

484
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

485
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,101
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.
We can lower her body temperature.</font>

486
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,712
<font color="yellow">Can I do the cooling pads for her?</font>

487
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,419
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

488
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:41,113
<font color="yellow"><i>[Kang Kyung Joon]</i></font>

489
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:42,736
<font color="yellow">Yes, what is it?</font>

490
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:46,183
<font color="yellow">Lee Hae Young's guardian
wants to speak to you.</font>

491
00:31:46,924 --> 00:31:48,555
<font color="yellow">- Put him on.
- Okay.</font>

492
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:53,745
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

493
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,853
<font color="yellow">Hello, this is Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

494
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:59,284
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I could not be there
due to personal matters.</font>

495
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,028
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stay and take responsibility.</font>

496
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:06,374
<font color="yellow">I want to take my wife off life support.</font>

497
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,222
<font color="yellow">Kim Woo Jin.</font>

498
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:28,917
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

499
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:34,128
<font color="yellow">I said I loved my wife more than anyone.</font>

500
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,836
<font color="yellow">Yet, I'm putting her
through so much pain.</font>

501
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:46,535
<font color="yellow">She's so swollen and hurt.
I can't even recognize her anymore.</font>

502
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:50,085
<font color="yellow">I think I'm being too selfish.</font>

503
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:52,956
<font color="yellow">If you were being selfish,
you wouldn't have come this far.</font>

504
00:32:53,535 --> 00:32:55,264
<font color="yellow">I want to give up.</font>

505
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,476
<font color="yellow">I want to let everything go.</font>

506
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:02,164
<font color="yellow">I want to let her rest.</font>

507
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,201
<font color="yellow">If you give up now...</font>

508
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,632
<font color="yellow">everything she did to protect
that child will be all for nothing.</font>

509
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,673
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't she resent me?</font>

510
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,984
<font color="yellow">Your wife is still holding on.</font>

511
00:33:14,984 --> 00:33:16,426
<font color="yellow">It's for the both of you.</font>

512
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,995
<font color="yellow">Because she loves you and the baby.</font>

513
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,710
<font color="yellow">You need to hold on too.</font>

514
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,191
<font color="yellow">If you're going to hang on,
then so will I.</font>

515
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,288
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

516
00:34:05,896 --> 00:34:07,140
<font color="yellow">Brother.</font>

517
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,440
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

518
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:14,160
<font color="yellow">It's to help with your hospital fees.</font>

519
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,652
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy, kid?</font>

520
00:34:16,652 --> 00:34:20,368
<font color="yellow">Why not? I never even went to
the store and I saved it all.</font>

521
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:22,049
<font color="yellow">Is it too little?</font>

522
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:23,631
<font color="yellow">You use it.</font>

523
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,430
<font color="yellow">I gave you allowance and this is
what you've been doing?</font>

524
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,718
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this?
I want to help too.</font>

525
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,468
<font color="yellow">Young Soo.</font>

526
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:36,794
<font color="yellow">If you want to do something,
can't you do something more productive?</font>

527
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:42,209
<font color="yellow">Take this and go to the store.
Eat whatever you want.</font>

528
00:34:42,978 --> 00:34:44,451
<font color="yellow">Don't act like you have nothing.</font>

529
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:49,748
<font color="yellow">Your brother is a doctor.
I only have to pay half of the fees.</font>

530
00:34:49,748 --> 00:34:51,989
<font color="yellow">I make 40 million won a year.</font>

531
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,475
<font color="yellow">I do pretty well.</font>

532
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:54,728
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

533
00:34:55,728 --> 00:34:57,768
<font color="yellow">But don't you need a place?</font>

534
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:59,430
<font color="yellow">You can't even work for a while.</font>

535
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,417
<font color="yellow">Stop worrying about useless things
and just eat what you want!</font>

536
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:03,872
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay!</font>

537
00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:05,848
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I can use it, then.</font>

538
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,118
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

539
00:35:16,928 --> 00:35:18,103
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

540
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:19,968
<font color="yellow">Don't be sick.</font>

541
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,109
<font color="yellow">I was really scared.</font>

542
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:26,149
<font color="yellow">Hey... why would you be scared?</font>

543
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,674
<font color="yellow">Does your brother ever lose?</font>

544
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:32,978
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

545
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,665
<font color="yellow">Salute!</font>

546
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,372
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

547
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:46,015
<font color="yellow">- I'll be going, then.
- I'll walk you out.</font>

548
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,989
<font color="yellow">Section Chief.</font>

549
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:56,431
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, I was about to leave
because you weren't there.</font>

550
00:35:56,431 --> 00:35:58,823
<font color="yellow">I was just saying bye to my brother.</font>

551
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,993
<font color="yellow">What do you plan to do
after you get discharged?</font>

552
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,127
<font color="yellow">I haven't really thought about it.</font>

553
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:07,207
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to work in our department?
- What?</font>

554
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:10,335
<font color="yellow">- As what?
- Department secretary.</font>

555
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,544
<font color="yellow">Our current one is quitting
for personal reasons.</font>

556
00:36:13,544 --> 00:36:15,924
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to start working
as a doctor right away.</font>

557
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,853
<font color="yellow">You can get better for about six months
or a year while doing this job.</font>

558
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:21,993
<font color="yellow">Then start working as a doctor again.</font>

559
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,752
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

560
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,127
<font color="yellow">No need for thanks.</font>

561
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,616
<font color="yellow">Do a good job.</font>

562
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,194
<font color="yellow">Section Chief.</font>

563
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,395
<font color="yellow">Take good care of yourself.</font>

564
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,902
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- All right.</font>

565
00:36:57,062 --> 00:36:58,352
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji Hong.</font>

566
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:03,881
<font color="yellow">I heard. What happened?</font>

567
00:37:03,881 --> 00:37:05,705
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Doctor.</font>

568
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:07,495
<font color="yellow">Tell me the reason why.</font>

569
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:11,596
<font color="yellow">Does it make any sense that you would be
a researcher and not a surgeon?</font>

570
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,556
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as taking a short break.</font>

571
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:17,627
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can be away
from patients even for a bit?</font>

572
00:37:17,627 --> 00:37:19,375
<font color="yellow">It's only a short break, Doctor.</font>

573
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:24,848
<font color="yellow">Have you looked into
Director Jin's embezzlement?</font>

574
00:37:24,848 --> 00:37:27,218
<font color="yellow">Director Jin did misappropriate funds.</font>

575
00:37:27,218 --> 00:37:28,767
<font color="yellow">There is lots of evidence to be found.</font>

576
00:37:28,767 --> 00:37:30,846
<font color="yellow">His property and assets should be public.</font>

577
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:33,511
<font color="yellow">We can look into those records in detail.</font>

578
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:35,254
<font color="yellow">I think we can figure out
what he's been doing</font>

579
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:36,998
<font color="yellow">with the money from those businesses.</font>

580
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:40,701
<font color="yellow">If it's money from over 10 years,
that's a lot of money in the slush fund.</font>

581
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:45,022
<font color="yellow">I can see why Board Director Jin
was afraid of it getting out.</font>

582
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,426
<font color="yellow">That is, if this is what
your father had on him.</font>

583
00:37:47,426 --> 00:37:50,325
<font color="yellow">I think the probability of this is high.
We need to investigate.</font>

584
00:37:50,325 --> 00:37:51,506
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

585
00:37:52,174 --> 00:37:54,453
<font color="yellow">Are you not planning on
attending the board meeting?</font>

586
00:37:54,453 --> 00:37:56,132
<font color="yellow">No, I should go.</font>

587
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:58,879
<font color="yellow">I should go see the
Senior Health Center voted down.</font>

588
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:01,942
<font color="yellow">All right, then. Let's go.</font>

589
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:06,509
<font color="yellow">You're sure we have the votes?</font>

590
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,172
<font color="yellow">I am the board director.</font>

591
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,259
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

592
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,748
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

593
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,062
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

594
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,116
<font color="yellow">Oh, Yoon Do.</font>

595
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:24,855
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

596
00:38:24,855 --> 00:38:26,895
<font color="yellow">- I'm glad you're here. Let's go.
- Yes.</font>

597
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:34,087
<font color="yellow">I will be leading this meeting
in place of the director.</font>

598
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:35,835
<font color="yellow">We have two matters to vote on today.</font>

599
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:38,419
<font color="yellow">First, it is the construction of the
Senior Health Center.</font>

600
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:41,285
<font color="yellow">Second is the expansion of the
foundation's social welfare program.</font>

601
00:38:41,948 --> 00:38:47,219
<font color="yellow">We presented these issues at the
last meeting, so we'll skip that today.</font>

602
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,178
<font color="yellow">You can go over the report
in front of you.</font>

603
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,658
<font color="yellow">Let's go straight to the voting.</font>

604
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,848
<font color="yellow">All right. We will vote.</font>

605
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:19,285
<font color="yellow"><i>[Three weeks later]</i></font>

606
00:39:22,381 --> 00:39:24,859
<font color="yellow">She passed out on her way back
from morning prayer at church.</font>

607
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,171
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll take a look.</font>

608
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:27,788
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?
Was she unconscious from the start?</font>

609
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:28,788
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

610
00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:37,011
<font color="yellow">- Did you take a CT?
- Yes, she has a brain hemorrhage.</font>

611
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:40,341
<font color="yellow">What about a guardian?</font>

612
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:42,750
<font color="yellow">I called and he is coming now.</font>

613
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,397
<font color="yellow">Contact Anesthesiology and book an OR.</font>

614
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:46,524
<font color="yellow">Which professor should I call?</font>

615
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:49,468
<font color="yellow">Professor Hong isn't doing surgeries.
Call Professor Jung Yoon Do.</font>

616
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:50,696
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

617
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:58,344
<font color="yellow">How is the construction of the
Senior Health Center going?</font>

618
00:39:58,344 --> 00:40:01,306
<font color="yellow">The management team is coming up
with a budget now.</font>

619
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,975
<font color="yellow">Oh! Professor Hong.</font>

620
00:40:06,565 --> 00:40:09,314
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Is your research going well?</font>

621
00:40:09,314 --> 00:40:11,647
<font color="yellow">It's going all right. Bye, now.</font>

622
00:40:15,707 --> 00:40:17,745
<font color="yellow">You have enough funds to build it, right?</font>

623
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:20,234
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get quotes from
construction companies.</font>

624
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:23,323
<font color="yellow">We'll get it done as soon as possible.</font>

625
00:40:23,323 --> 00:40:24,377
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

626
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:26,890
<font color="yellow">They're very jubilant.</font>

627
00:40:27,442 --> 00:40:28,654
<font color="yellow">Because they won.</font>

628
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:32,799
<font color="yellow">I have evidence.</font>

629
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:36,703
<font color="yellow">These are funds that
those facilities earned</font>

630
00:40:36,703 --> 00:40:38,471
<font color="yellow">that did not come into the hospital.</font>

631
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:41,158
<font color="yellow">These businesses say they worked
with these off-site facilities.</font>

632
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:43,921
<font color="yellow">But these facilities never transferred
their payment to the hospital.</font>

633
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,335
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

634
00:40:45,335 --> 00:40:47,658
<font color="yellow">500 million won in the last year.</font>

635
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:49,299
<font color="yellow">500 million won...</font>

636
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:52,105
<font color="yellow">That's a small amount for charging
Board Director Jin with embezzlement.</font>

637
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,328
<font color="yellow">It's small enough
to get out of it easily.</font>

638
00:40:55,504 --> 00:40:57,777
<font color="yellow">- How much is it?
- 10 billion won.</font>

639
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:00,540
<font color="yellow">That's a lot.</font>

640
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,410
<font color="yellow">Is Ji Hong's DBS sensor
that big of a deal?</font>

641
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,234
<font color="yellow">If he can make it, it will be.</font>

642
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,535
<font color="yellow">So, why aren't you
having him do surgeries?</font>

643
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:09,582
<font color="yellow">Just strip him of his board member title.</font>

644
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:11,142
<font color="yellow">Don't you know surgeons, Dad?</font>

645
00:41:11,698 --> 00:41:14,768
<font color="yellow">They want to be out in the field.
They don't like office work.</font>

646
00:41:15,207 --> 00:41:17,372
<font color="yellow">Watch him keep accepting
and treating patients.</font>

647
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:19,745
<font color="yellow">A few years from now,
we won't even survive.</font>

648
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,562
<font color="yellow">About the budget for the
Senior Health Center...</font>

649
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:30,392
<font color="yellow">can't we take some money from the
investment funds that Ji Hong brought in?</font>

650
00:41:30,392 --> 00:41:33,616
<font color="yellow"><i>I think they're taking money out
from the off-site facility profits.</i></font>

651
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,453
<font color="yellow">When did those facilities
start making notable profits?</font>

652
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:37,964
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

653
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:42,576
<font color="yellow">We've held funerals here
at the hospital for the past 20 years.</font>

654
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:49,564
<font color="yellow">I just can't stop thinking that my dad
had a record of the slush fund.</font>

655
00:41:50,194 --> 00:41:51,736
<font color="yellow">Let's organize this.</font>

656
00:41:51,736 --> 00:41:54,274
<font color="yellow">Director Jin attacked your father first.</font>

657
00:41:54,274 --> 00:41:56,792
<font color="yellow"><i>With the stocks and the investigation
by the National Tax Administration.</i></font>

658
00:41:56,792 --> 00:42:00,573
<font color="yellow"><i>Then your father fought back
by refusing to retire.</i></font>

659
00:42:00,573 --> 00:42:03,611
<font color="yellow"><i>Then Director Jin quit on his own.
Your father's attack worked.</i></font>

660
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:08,234
<font color="yellow">Yes, I don't think anything would
make him quit on his own, except this.</font>

661
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:12,004
<font color="yellow">So, what were they arguing about
for 20 minutes?</font>

662
00:42:12,004 --> 00:42:14,297
<font color="yellow">Did he get his
slush fund file taken away?</font>

663
00:42:14,297 --> 00:42:16,933
<font color="yellow">He was going to use that
against Director Jin.</font>

664
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:20,174
<font color="yellow">Did Board Director Jin find it
and use it against your father?</font>

665
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,732
<font color="yellow">That theory makes the most sense.</font>

666
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:24,855
<font color="yellow">But, Ji Hong...</font>

667
00:42:25,772 --> 00:42:28,993
<font color="yellow">We know your father very well.</font>

668
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:30,754
<font color="yellow">We do.</font>

669
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:35,955
<font color="yellow">- There's another copy.
- There's another copy.</font>

670
00:42:35,955 --> 00:42:37,652
<font color="yellow">There's definitely another copy.</font>

671
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:42,524
<font color="yellow">There's no way he would
only make one. Would you?</font>

672
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:45,913
<font color="yellow">I would make multiple copies
and leave them hidden.</font>

673
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:47,071
<font color="yellow">Look for it.</font>

674
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:49,404
<font color="yellow">- It's around you somewhere.
- Okay.</font>

675
00:42:49,404 --> 00:42:51,442
<font color="yellow">You look for it too, Doctor.</font>

676
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:58,042
<font color="yellow">If we can find that slush fund file,
this long fight can end.</font>

677
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:10,422
<font color="yellow">I told you to come to my office.
Why did you want to meet here?</font>

678
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,261
<font color="yellow">You were with the board director.</font>

679
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,870
<font color="yellow">I only wanted to meet you.</font>

680
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,027
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you want to apologize?</font>

681
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:20,192
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to support me and
you voted for Professor Hong?</font>

682
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:23,723
<font color="yellow">It's my belief that I should vote for
what I truly believe in.</font>

683
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:26,837
<font color="yellow">I am sorry if that bothered you.</font>

684
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,538
<font color="yellow">It's okay. He still only got
one-third of the votes.</font>

685
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:34,756
<font color="yellow">Do you enjoy being on the losing side?
Your father isn't like that.</font>

686
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:36,426
<font color="yellow">I like winning too.</font>

687
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:39,379
<font color="yellow">So... I looked into it a bit.</font>

688
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:40,421
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

689
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:43,759
<font color="yellow">The records of our
hospital's off-site facilities.</font>

690
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,216
<font color="yellow">They're a little different.</font>

691
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:47,219
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

692
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:49,308
<font color="yellow">I don't think this will be anything big.</font>

693
00:43:49,308 --> 00:43:51,031
<font color="yellow">But it will still be a threat to you.</font>

694
00:43:51,031 --> 00:43:52,239
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Yoon Do!</font>

695
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,839
<font color="yellow">Leave Doctor Yoo Hye Jung alone.</font>

696
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,529
<font color="yellow">Then I will also back off.</font>

697
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:12,238
<font color="yellow">Hong Sang Tae has been
moved into a room, right?</font>

698
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:14,277
<font color="yellow">Yes, he was moved up.</font>

699
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,522
<font color="yellow">He'll need to be checked often,
and he needs to be in rehab.</font>

700
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:20,056
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Doctor! Did you buy ours too?</font>

701
00:44:20,056 --> 00:44:22,306
<font color="yellow">Of course I bought it.</font>

702
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:24,395
<font color="yellow">You should've bought snacks
while you were out.</font>

703
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:28,421
<font color="yellow">Of course I bought snacks too.</font>

704
00:44:28,421 --> 00:44:30,578
<font color="yellow">Wow! You are great at this.</font>

705
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:33,084
<font color="yellow">You are a natural
at this secretary thing.</font>

706
00:44:33,084 --> 00:44:34,118
<font color="yellow">Have some, Doctor.</font>

707
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:36,018
<font color="yellow">You're lucky to be so talented.</font>

708
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:38,837
<font color="yellow">- Doctor!
- You're back.</font>

709
00:44:38,837 --> 00:44:40,334
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't she eat some tofu?</font>

710
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:41,602
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

711
00:44:41,602 --> 00:44:43,107
<font color="yellow">Did I go to jail or something?</font>

712
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:44,386
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

713
00:44:44,386 --> 00:44:46,596
<font color="yellow">How is that patient with
the epidural hemorrhage?</font>

714
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:48,632
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. That patient is okay.</font>

715
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,062
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

716
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,221
<font color="yellow">Your hair grew a lot.</font>

717
00:44:52,221 --> 00:44:53,991
<font color="yellow">I can get a perm.</font>

718
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,370
<font color="yellow">You look like a little chestnut.</font>

719
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:58,743
<font color="yellow">No, don't get a perm. I hate that.</font>

720
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
<font color="yellow">You look cute.</font>

721
00:45:05,651 --> 00:45:07,098
<font color="yellow">Have you been doing well?</font>

722
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,578
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

723
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,439
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dad.</font>

724
00:45:44,357 --> 00:45:46,908
<font color="yellow">I'm getting lunch with your grandpa.
Let's go together.</font>

725
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,098
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have surgery to prepare for.</font>

726
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:58,913
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

727
00:45:58,913 --> 00:46:01,335
<font color="yellow">did something happen between
you and my father?</font>

728
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:02,402
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

729
00:46:02,402 --> 00:46:03,431
<font color="yellow">It's just strange.</font>

730
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,794
<font color="yellow">My dad liked you a lot.</font>

731
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:09,326
<font color="yellow">His attitude changed and the
punishment was very harsh.</font>

732
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:11,022
<font color="yellow">You should ask your dad about it.</font>

733
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:13,212
<font color="yellow">I asked him and he's avoiding it.</font>

734
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,511
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

735
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:21,582
<font color="yellow">Will it hurt your dad if I hurt you?</font>

736
00:46:22,136 --> 00:46:24,343
<font color="yellow">Do you want to hurt my dad?</font>

737
00:46:28,053 --> 00:46:30,714
<font color="yellow">Sorry. It has nothing to do with you.</font>

738
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:34,143
<font color="yellow">If you hurt me, it will hurt my parents.</font>

739
00:46:34,143 --> 00:46:36,951
<font color="yellow">Tell me what happened
between the two of you.</font>

740
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,531
<font color="yellow">When I look at you...</font>

741
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,964
<font color="yellow">I'm always reminded of the time
we hung out after our midterms.</font>

742
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:53,614
<font color="yellow">I never imagined I'd become
a doctor back then.</font>

743
00:47:19,777 --> 00:47:21,877
<font color="yellow">This flower is so pretty.</font>

744
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:23,513
<font color="yellow">- So pretty.
- Be careful.</font>

745
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:26,243
<font color="yellow">Did you do well on the test?</font>

746
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,147
<font color="yellow">I don't know because I've
never done well on a test before.</font>

747
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:31,283
<font color="yellow">I've given up.</font>

748
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,103
<font color="yellow">Given up on math.</font>

749

<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, how can you be so good at math?</font>

751
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:41,372
<font color="yellow">I work hard at it.</font>

752
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:42,922
<font color="yellow">You don't.</font>

753
00:47:42,922 --> 00:47:45,102
<font color="yellow">You have to put in the effort
to get the results.</font>

754
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:47,828
<font color="yellow">You sound just like my dad.</font>

755
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:53,042
<font color="yellow">I really want to graduate
high school quickly.</font>

756
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:55,198
<font color="yellow">Then I want to get married.</font>

757
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,290
<font color="yellow">I'm only going to have one child.</font>

758
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:01,178
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to have a kid
when I'm really old.</font>

759
00:48:02,477 --> 00:48:07,381
<font color="yellow">But out of the three of us,
I think Seo Woo will get married first.</font>

760
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:11,468
<font color="yellow">No way! I'm going to become
a doctor like my dad.</font>

761
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:14,051
<font color="yellow">Even if I do get married,
I have to graduate medical school.</font>

762
00:48:14,629 --> 00:48:16,120
<font color="yellow">That's going to be six years.</font>

763
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,098
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do, Hye Jung?</font>

764
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:23,908
<font color="yellow">I'm going to run the rice soup
restaurant with my grandma.</font>

765
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:25,997
<font color="yellow">One location of Granny's Rice Soup,
and then a second location.</font>

766
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:29,007
<font color="yellow">I'm going to earn lots of money and
let my grandma live in comfort.</font>

767
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:30,406
<font color="yellow">I want the third location.</font>

768
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:34,228
<font color="yellow">Me too, me too! I'll put in my money too.</font>

769
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:35,551
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

770
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:37,000
<font color="yellow">I'll do the fourth and fifth location.</font>

771
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,922
<font color="yellow">Let's just do it together, then.</font>

772
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:42,250
<font color="yellow">I'll count all the money.
What do you think?</font>

773
00:48:53,821 --> 00:48:57,571
<font color="yellow">Young Gook, do people not like my dad?</font>

774
00:48:58,288 --> 00:49:01,009
<font color="yellow">Well, not everyone likes him.</font>

775
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:04,151
<font color="yellow">But, lots of people like him too.</font>

776
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,732
<font color="yellow">I don't want to know about that.</font>

777
00:49:08,924 --> 00:49:10,683
<font color="yellow">I'm going to stop everything here.</font>

779
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:30,667

780
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,995
<font color="yellow">- I should.
- Let's eat together.</font>

781
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:34,991
<font color="yellow">- Ah...
- Ah.</font>

782
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,542
<font color="yellow">Think about what I did for you.</font>

783
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,466
<font color="yellow">I went into the board meeting.</font>

784
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:41,732
<font color="yellow">Can't friends even eat together?</font>

785
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:45,312
<font color="yellow">We're friends now, right?</font>

786
00:49:45,953 --> 00:49:47,042
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

787
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,267
<font color="yellow">How is your revenge going?</font>

788
00:49:50,982 --> 00:49:52,584
<font color="yellow">There's no progress.</font>

789
00:49:52,584 --> 00:49:56,216
<font color="yellow">The only thing I can do is
keep working at the hospital.</font>

790
00:49:57,065 --> 00:49:59,696
<font color="yellow">That's good. Let's go eat.</font>

791
00:50:05,676 --> 00:50:07,886

794
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:17,310

795
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,529
<font color="yellow">- How about you?
- So are we.</font>

796
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,748
<font color="yellow">How is it that you're together?</font>

797
00:50:24,748 --> 00:50:26,651

798
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:28,649
<font color="yellow">We'll get going now.</font>

799

800
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:38,529
<font color="yellow">I like her because she's tough.</font>

801
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:41,819
<font color="yellow">I just hate that Yoon Do.
I ought to get rid of him too.</font>

802
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,730

he'd be gone already.</font>

Why are you so worried?</font>

There's no need for it.</font>
