It's just local dialect.</font>

35

41

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,360
<font color="yellow">I don't know how much you really know
about my granddaughter.</font>

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,380
<font color="yellow">Erase it all.</font>

151
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,360
<font color="yellow">Please take care of my granddaughter.</font>

152
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,850
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung is very bright.</font>

153
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,720
<font color="yellow">She needs motivation rather than praise.</font>

154
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,540
<font color="yellow">That's why she's acting out,
so don't worry too much.</font>

155
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,200
<font color="yellow">When her mother was alive</font>

156
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,850
<font color="yellow">the whole neighborhood talked about
how smart she was.</font>

157
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,840
<font color="yellow">She would read all the signs
even though no one taught her.</font>

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,020
<font color="yellow">What is this now, seriously?</font>

159
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,290
<font color="yellow">You're already in a good mood.
You're a simple person.</font>

160
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,680
<font color="yellow">Don't tell her we had this talk.</font>

161
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, my legs are cramping.</font>

162
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,480
<font color="yellow">She should be home soon.</font>

163
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,260
<font color="yellow">Oh, it fits you well.</font>

164
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,790
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy another one?
I think this would still fit you.</font>

165
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,520
<font color="yellow">To show you my affection.</font>

166
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,270
<font color="yellow">I'm deficient in affection.</font>

167
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,040
<font color="yellow">Look. Ta-da!</font>

168
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,700
<font color="yellow">You look so pretty.</font>

169
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,140
<font color="yellow">You have big breasts.</font>

170
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,220
<font color="yellow">I envy you!</font>

171
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,830
<font color="yellow">- Should I tell you a secret?
- Yes, please.</font>

172
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
<font color="yellow">They're different in size.</font>

173
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,000
<font color="yellow">What the heck!</font>

174
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,120
<font color="yellow">- I think I should confirm.
- Are you insane?</font>

175
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,350
<font color="yellow">- Sorry, but I want to see.
- No way!</font>

176
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,080
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

177
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,100
<font color="yellow">We're here!</font>

178
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,240
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

179
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,160
<font color="yellow">Wait for your mom.</font>

180
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,650
<font color="yellow">Hello, kid.</font>

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,190
<font color="yellow">You bought a uniform?</font>

182
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,500
<font color="yellow">You're not even going to answer me now?</font>

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,520
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

184
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,120
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you sick?</font>

185
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,950
<font color="yellow">Mom, are you sick?</font>

186
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,510
<font color="yellow">Sis, please do something.</font>

187
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,670
<font color="yellow">Ma'am? Ma'am?</font>

188
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,750
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

189
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,620
<font color="yellow">Patient, are you all right?</font>

190
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,420
<font color="yellow">- Call an ambulance.
- Okay.</font>

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,260
<font color="yellow">Hello, someone has passed out here.
She's pregnant.</font>

192
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,470
<font color="yellow">We're at the Geumgok-dong bus stop.</font>

193
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,570
<font color="yellow">Teacher... Teacher, there's water.</font>

194
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,200
<font color="yellow">Her water broke.
She's going to have the baby.</font>

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,300
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do?</font>

196
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,440
<font color="yellow">You had a minor surgery.
Why are you still in bed?</font>

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,930
<font color="yellow">We have lots of work to do.</font>

198
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,360
<font color="yellow">I might resign from being director
and go to the US.</font>

199
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,730
<font color="yellow">Why would you go to the US?</font>

200
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,100
<font color="yellow">I want to study business
and social welfare.</font>

201
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,620
<font color="yellow">You're a surgeon to the bone,
so why would you study that?</font>

202
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,330
<font color="yellow">You and I both need to change now.</font>

203
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,090
<font color="yellow"><i>[SON]</i></font>

204
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,680
<font color="yellow">I have an emergency patient.</font>

205
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,430
<font color="yellow">Call Doctor Kim Tae Ho for me.</font>

206
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,680
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

207
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,840
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Your mom will be okay.</font>

208
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,040
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

209
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,890
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Both of you, be quiet.</font>

210
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,050
<font color="yellow">A pregnant woman in her mid-thirties.</font>

211
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,670
<font color="yellow">Both her pupillary reflex</font>

212
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,190
<font color="yellow">and her pupil dilation in the right eye
are five millimeters.</font>

213
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,950
<font color="yellow">She's experiencing paralysis in the left.</font>

214
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,720
<font color="yellow">It has to be a hemorrhage or
cerebral infarction in the right brain.</font>

215
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,600
<font color="yellow">It could be a
cerebral arterial hemorrhage.</font>

216
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
<font color="yellow">How can I confirm?</font>

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,480
<font color="yellow">You won't know with the naked eye.
Did you call an ambulance?</font>

218
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,940
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

219
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,910
<font color="yellow">But, her water broke three minutes ago.</font>

220
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,910
<font color="yellow">There is no hospital here with
both neurology and obstetrics.</font>

221
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,890
<font color="yellow">Get us in your hospital, Dad.</font>

222
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,050
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

223
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,950
<font color="yellow">Teacher, Teacher!</font>

224
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,380
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello? Hello?</i></font>

225
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,240
<font color="yellow"><i>What's going on?</i></font>

226
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,400
<font color="yellow">She just threw up.</font>

227
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,070
<font color="yellow">She's having trouble breathing.</font>

228
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,700
<font color="yellow">I think we need to intubate her.</font>

229
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,160
<font color="yellow">If the ambulance doesn't come on time,
I'll have to make do a trachea incision.</font>

230
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,410
<font color="yellow">Don't do it.</font>

231
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,390
<font color="yellow">How can you do it without
any proper surgical tools?</font>

232
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:06,030
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong,
you really can't be a doctor again.</font>

233
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,810
<font color="yellow"><i>If this goes wrong...</i></font>

234
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,900
<font color="yellow"><i>you can harm the artery, cause bleeding,
and damage the thyroid gland.</i></font>

235
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,720
<font color="yellow">Hold your mom's hand
and give her strength.</font>

236
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,270
<font color="yellow">Why would we do that?</font>

237
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,460
<font color="yellow">You hold on too.</font>

238
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,500
<font color="yellow">You don't love with the heart.
You love with the brain.</font>

239
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,240
<font color="yellow">It's what lets you decide
whether you like or dislike a person.</font>

240
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,880
<font color="yellow">The brain can feel too.</font>

241
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,430
<font color="yellow">Are you really a doctor?</font>

242
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,800
<font color="yellow">Do you have a knife?</font>

243
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,060
<font color="yellow">Do you need it for the trachea incision?</font>

244
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,460
<font color="yellow">You pick things up fast.</font>

245
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,540
<font color="yellow">I'll go get one.</font>

246
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,600
<font color="yellow">What if things go wrong?</font>

247
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,230
<font color="yellow">Can things get worse than this?</font>

248
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,320
<font color="yellow">- They can.
- But you still have to do it.</font>

249
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,480
<font color="yellow">We need to intubate her.
Give me an an tube for her trachea.</font>

250
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,160
<font color="yellow">- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.</font>

251
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,850
<font color="yellow">Give me the laryngoscope.</font>

252
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,350
<font color="yellow">Please hold on a little longer.</font>

253
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,310
<font color="yellow">Tube, please.</font>

254
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,150
<font color="yellow">Please take that out.</font>

255
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,000
<font color="yellow">Gookil Hospital in Seoul. Hurry, please.</font>

256
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,390
<font color="yellow">- Get off.
- No, I can't.</font>

257
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,060
<font color="yellow">Hold your mom's hand.</font>

258
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,710
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

259
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,030
<font color="yellow">You must have been in quite a rush
to come to this hospital.</font>

260
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,560
<font color="yellow">How did you get in?</font>

261
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,450
<font color="yellow">Connections, of course.</font>

262
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,360
<font color="yellow">How did it feel to watch a patient dying
and not be able to do anything?</font>

263
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,960
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that it was only a
hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage.</font>

264
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,140
<font color="yellow">The real relief is that
she met a doctor like you.</font>

265
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,470
<font color="yellow">It's also a relief that
she didn't have an aneurysm.</font>

266
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,970
<font color="yellow">If that were the case...</font>

267
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,800
<font color="yellow">that patient would have died while
you were debating intubation.</font>

268
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,270
<font color="yellow">Then you would have spent your whole life
blaming yourself again.</font>

269
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,480
<font color="yellow">Because you blame yourself for the death
of every patient who doesn't make it.</font>

270
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,400
<font color="yellow">You've become very harsh lately.</font>

271
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,550
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

272
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,560
<font color="yellow">You need to see the real dangers
of a real neurosurgeon now.</font>

273
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,960
<font color="yellow">I am going to save that patient.</font>

274
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,570
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

275
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,650
<font color="yellow">Because it's me.</font>

276
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,890
<font color="yellow">Because I am Kim Tae Ho.</font>

277
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,410
<font color="yellow">Defibrillator.</font>

278
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,800
<font color="yellow">I'll go contact someone.</font>

279
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
<font color="yellow">Did you check that patient for a fever
before the surgery or not?</font>

280
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,800
<font color="yellow">The intern probably did that.</font>

281
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,880
<font color="yellow">Probably did?</font>

282
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,380
<font color="yellow">"Probably did"? You punk!
What were you doing?</font>

283
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,930
<font color="yellow">If this becomes a problem,
you take responsibility for it, okay?</font>

284
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,830
<font color="yellow">Hey! Why do I have to
hear this crap because of you?</font>

285
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:06,320
<font color="yellow">You don't even
deserve to sleep, you punk.</font>

286
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,990
<font color="yellow">Don't even eat.</font>

287
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,090
<font color="yellow">The surgery went very well.
Don't worry.</font>

288
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,960
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.</font>

289
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,990
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,380
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.
She'll be moved to a room soon.</font>

291
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,450
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

292
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,630
<font color="yellow">Go on in.</font>

293
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,770
<font color="yellow"><i>You don't love with the heart.</i></font>

294
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,170
<font color="yellow"><i>You love with the brain.</i></font>

295
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,840
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you, young lady. Thank you so much.</i></font>

296
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,350
<font color="yellow">No, it was my teacher who did everything.</font>

297
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,010
<font color="yellow">- What is your name?
- What?</font>

298
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,450
<font color="yellow">I want to name my daughter after you.</font>

299
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:14,130
<font color="yellow">I want her to grow up
and help others like you.</font>

300
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,840
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

301
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,800
<font color="yellow">Welcome...</font>

302
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. This is 10,000 won for the CD.</font>

303
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,620
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to live differently now.</font>

304
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,670
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I could
until I paid you back.</font>

305
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,120
<font color="yellow">I can't accept this.</font>

306
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,690
<font color="yellow">Is it not enough?</font>

307
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,390
<font color="yellow">Give it to Teacher Hong Ji Hong at
South Yangju Girls High School.</font>

308
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,240
<font color="yellow">He came back that day
with the CD and the money.</font>

309
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,580
<font color="yellow">He said he found it on the street.</font>

310
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,640
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

311
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,430
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

312
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,740
<font color="yellow">- I have something to say.
- Say it.</font>

313
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,210
<font color="yellow">Can't I come in?</font>

314
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,740
<font color="yellow">No, it's too messy.</font>

315
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's a total mess.</font>

316
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,880
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

317
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,940
<font color="yellow">I'm cleaning.</font>

318
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,300
<font color="yellow">Put that back down!</font>

319
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,040
<font color="yellow">It may look like a mess to you,
but there is an order to it all.</font>

320
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,230
<font color="yellow">I hate it when people
touch my belongings.</font>

321
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,120
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

322
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,130
<font color="yellow">So, what brings you to my room?</font>

323
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,750
<font color="yellow">Do you want to become friendly with me?</font>

324
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think you are kind of cool.</font>

325
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,210
<font color="yellow">You tend to say things suddenly
without any warning.</font>

326
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,410
<font color="yellow">Doctors make more money than teachers
and get more recognition.</font>

327
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,580
<font color="yellow">Yet, you gave up on being a doctor
and became a teacher.</font>

328
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,020
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

329
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,490
<font color="yellow">"Why did you do that?"</font>

330
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,860
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I did that?</font>

331
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,090
<font color="yellow">I thought about it
and I can't figure it out.</font>

332
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,930
<font color="yellow">All the books on your floor
are all medical books.</font>

333
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,740
<font color="yellow">It seems like you still have an
attachment to being a doctor.</font>

334
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,660
<font color="yellow">Ah! Were you kicked out?</font>

335
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,050
<font color="yellow">I left on my own.</font>

336
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,370
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

337
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,930
<font color="yellow">I didn't give up on being a doctor.</font>

338
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,710
<font color="yellow">I consider being a teacher
an extension of being a doctor.</font>

339
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,150
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand that,
but let's say that's true.</font>

340
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,010
<font color="yellow">That saying about
brains having feelings...</font>

341
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,750
<font color="yellow">Where did you hear that?</font>

342
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,850
<font color="yellow">I thought that up.</font>

343
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,060
<font color="yellow">Oh, that is great.</font>

344
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,860
<font color="yellow">You were talking about
all that other stuff.</font>

345
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,920
<font color="yellow">You sounded very smart.</font>

346
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,250
<font color="yellow">I see you have completely fallen for me.</font>

347
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,220
<font color="yellow">You'll end writing
a biography on my great life.</font>

348
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,580
<font color="yellow">I'm 18 years old.</font>

349
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,980
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this forever.</font>

350
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,520
<font color="yellow">I'm tired of it.</font>

351
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,900
<font color="yellow">Even I wanted to change before,
I had no reason to change.</font>

352
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,670
<font color="yellow">Now, I have a reason.</font>

353
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,060
<font color="yellow">What's that reason?</font>

354
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,210
<font color="yellow">I want my grandma to live in comfort.</font>

355
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, live in comfort.</font>

356
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,640
<font color="yellow">That's a very old word
for such a young girl to use.</font>

357
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,880
<font color="yellow">Be serious, please.
This is about my life.</font>

358
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,940
<font color="yellow">So, why are you telling me about this?</font>

359
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,600
<font color="yellow">I want to start living differently,
but I don't know how to.</font>

360
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,080
<font color="yellow">Sorry to say this from the beginning,
but you can't live a different way.</font>

361
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,280
<font color="yellow">You know how people say that
you have to fail in order to succeed?</font>

362
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,920
<font color="yellow">That's all a big lie.</font>

363
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,390
<font color="yellow">If you continue to fail,
you will never succeed.</font>

364
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,670
<font color="yellow">Only people who succeed will succeed.</font>

365
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,590
<font color="yellow">The only thing you learn from failure is</font>

366
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,990
<font color="yellow">how to feel bad about yourself
and feel small.</font>

367
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,850
<font color="yellow">I can succeed if I put my mind to it.</font>

368
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,030
<font color="yellow">Try it. We'll talk after you succeed.</font>

369
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,040
<font color="yellow">What can I succeed with right now?</font>

370
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,980
<font color="yellow">What can a student succeed with?
Do you really not know?</font>

371
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,670
<font color="yellow">Studying... how do I do it?</font>

372
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,970
<font color="yellow">I'm a teacher.
Your homeroom teacher, at that.</font>

373
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,760
<font color="yellow">I can't teach you how to study.
Go on, now.</font>

374
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

375
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,020
<font color="yellow">I went to the CD store.</font>

376
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,120
<font color="yellow"><i>Ji Hong!</i></font>

377
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,070
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

378
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,730
<font color="yellow">Who was that?</font>

379
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,700
<font color="yellow">Landlady's granddaughter.</font>

380
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'm glad you called.</font>

381
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,090
<font color="yellow">What? What's going on?</font>

382
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,500
<font color="yellow">Who's the smartest kid in our class?</font>

383
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,130
<font color="yellow">Over here! Seo Woo, here!</font>

384
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,360
<font color="yellow">Hurry, hurry.</font>

385
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,910
<font color="yellow">Sit, sit, sit.</font>

386
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,090
<font color="yellow">You know Hye Jung, right?</font>

387
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,510
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

388
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,530
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung, this is Seo Woo.</font>

389
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,220
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me to come?</font>

390
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,940
<font color="yellow">Here. This is the fish burger
that you like.</font>

391
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,050
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you wanted
instead of dragging it out.</font>

392
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,200
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung wants to start studying.</font>

393
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,810
<font color="yellow">She has no knowledge of the basics,
so she needs a teacher.</font>

394
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,620
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a mouth?</font>

395
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,490
<font color="yellow">Why is Soon Hee asking for your favor?</font>

396
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,760
<font color="yellow">Can you help me with my studies?</font>

397
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,870
<font color="yellow">I'm busy with my own studies.
You can go to an academy.</font>

398
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,930
<font color="yellow">We have our midterms in one week.</font>

399
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,410
<font color="yellow">I have to show our
homeroom teacher my report card.</font>

400
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,010
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to show it to him?</font>

401
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,050
<font color="yellow">Are you going to teach me?</font>

402
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,690
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to tell you
if you're not going to help me.</font>

403
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,020
<font color="yellow">You're kind of testy for someone
asking for a favor.</font>

404
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,790
<font color="yellow">We're seeing each other often.</font>

405
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,140
<font color="yellow">It must be fate.</font>

406
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,720
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's a new face.</font>

407
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,420
<font color="yellow">Nice atmosphere here.</font>

408
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,810
<font color="yellow">Oh! You're Jin Seo Woo, right?</font>

409
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,050
<font color="yellow">Best face at
South Yangju Girls High School.</font>

410
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,480
<font color="yellow">She's really smart
and her dad's a doctor.</font>

411
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,640
<font color="yellow">She's on a different level than us.</font>

412
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,040
<font color="yellow">She doesn't seem that great. Right?</font>

413
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me.</font>

414
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,430
<font color="yellow">I told you she's on a different level.</font>

415
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,920
<font color="yellow">"Don't touch me!"</font>

416
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,180
<font color="yellow">She told you not to touch her.
Don't you understand Korean?</font>

417
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,210
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you girls...</font>

418
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,010
<font color="yellow">Get over here.</font>

419
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,650
<font color="yellow">Enough.</font>

420
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,440
<font color="yellow">She's mine, so don't touch her.</font>

421
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,000
<font color="yellow">You must be kidding me.</font>

422
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,440
<font color="yellow">Why am I yours? I belong to me.</font>

423
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,030
<font color="yellow">No one can own me.</font>

424
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,510
<font color="yellow">These girls are with me.
Don't mess with them.</font>

425
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,550
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

426
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,040
<font color="yellow">Look at that rude arrogant thing.</font>

427
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,340
<font color="yellow">Hey, does that girl
have something on you?</font>

428
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,250
<font color="yellow">Why can't you take any action?</font>

429
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,950
<font color="yellow">Are they following us?</font>

430
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,950
<font color="yellow">They're following us!</font>

431
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,990
<font color="yellow">Run!</font>

432
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,040
<font color="yellow">Ah! Run!</font>

433
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,210
<font color="yellow">Get them!</font>

434
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,020
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

435
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,550
<font color="yellow">Run faster!</font>

436
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,550
<font color="yellow">That way.</font>

437
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,150
<font color="yellow">They're not coming anymore!</font>

438
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,330
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, seriously!</font>

439
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,250
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys so fast?</font>

440
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,910
<font color="yellow">I thought you were only good at studying.</font>

441
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,540
<font color="yellow">Really...</font>

442
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,060
<font color="yellow">- I'll help you study.
- Really?</font>

443
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,430
<font color="yellow">I want to check something with the
homeroom teacher first.</font>

444
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,570
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

445
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,590
<font color="yellow">Are those medical papers?</font>

446
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,590
<font color="yellow">Academic journal. I was bored.</font>

447
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,600
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

448
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,560
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tutor Hye Jung.</font>

449
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,800
<font color="yellow">I know it won't really do much good,
but I'll do it for you.</font>

450
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,980
<font color="yellow">For me?</font>

451
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,160
<font color="yellow">You always make me do chores,
but never the other kids.</font>

452
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,900
<font color="yellow">I know you're doing it on my behalf.</font>

453
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,060
<font color="yellow">Because all I do is study and
don't get any exercise besides breathing.</font>

454
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,260
<font color="yellow">You think I won't understand
so you reply, "Just because."</font>

455
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,840
<font color="yellow">You tailor your teaching to the students
based on their home environments.</font>

456
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing now?</font>

457
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,790
<font color="yellow">I like you, like a woman and a man.</font>

458
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,500
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking to date you now.
Wait two years for me.</font>

459
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,570
<font color="yellow">Don't marry In Joo.</font>

460
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,260
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go to medical school
and I can marry once I graduate.</font>

461
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,510
<font color="yellow">I won't make you an old bachelor.</font>

462
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,040
<font color="yellow">Jin Seo Woo, you've gone too far.</font>

463
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,580
<font color="yellow">I've told you my feelings.</font>

464
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,230
<font color="yellow">You said confessing your feelings is
better than not saying anything at all.</font>

465
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,800
<font color="yellow">I take that back.</font>

466
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,690
<font color="yellow">It's not so great from this position.</font>

467
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,310
<font color="yellow">Teacher...</font>

468
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,040
<font color="yellow">Also, it's your choice whether
you teach Hye Jung or not.</font>

469
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,730
<font color="yellow">Are you making a deal with it?</font>

470
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,970
<font color="yellow">You like warm people.</font>

471
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to let you know that
I'm becoming someone you like.</font>

472
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,060
<font color="yellow">Don't try to become
someone that others want.</font>

473
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,230
<font color="yellow">Become someone that you can like.</font>

474
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,680
<font color="yellow">Also, how can you confess
without even bringing chocolates?</font>

475
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,760
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

476
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,120
<font color="yellow">Grandma, you should've come earlier.
You've been getting worse.</font>

477
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,630
<font color="yellow">Is it very bad?</font>

478
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,710
<font color="yellow">The only good news is that you're old.</font>

479
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,550
<font color="yellow">How is being old good news?</font>

480
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,650
<font color="yellow">The cancer will progress slowly too.
It matches the speed of your body.</font>

481
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,690
<font color="yellow">You have to let life
push you down sometimes.</font>

482
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,070
<font color="yellow">That way I can avoid a bigger calamity
and live another 10 years.</font>

483
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,370
<font color="yellow">I have enough for
the surgery in my account.</font>

484
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,710
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

485
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,190
<font color="yellow">Grandma, you need to stop
talking to yourself.</font>

486
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,290
<font color="yellow">What are you always saying?</font>

487
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,490
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

488
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,160
<font color="yellow">To study.</font>

489
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,070
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's not go around lying like that.</font>

490
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,290
<font color="yellow">- I really am.
- Really?</font>

491
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,800
<font color="yellow">If you really are,
I have nothing more to wish for.</font>

492
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,260
<font color="yellow">What would you want me
to become, Grandma?</font>

493
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,130
<font color="yellow">Will you do it if I say so?</font>

494
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,420
<font color="yellow">I could.</font>

495
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,910
<font color="yellow">Then, become a doctor.</font>

496
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,540
<font color="yellow">You could wear a white gown, be called
Doctor, and people would bow to you.</font>

497
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,680
<font color="yellow">You'd make good money. I like that.</font>

498
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,240
<font color="yellow">You have big dreams.
Can just anyone become a doctor?</font>

499
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,270
<font color="yellow">Tell me something more realistic.</font>

500
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,330
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You can't even dream big.</font>

501
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,760
<font color="yellow">You were born into this world,
so why not live a special life?</font>

502
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,380
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you show me
something like that before I die?</font>

503
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,210
<font color="yellow">People keep asking me
to show them something these days.</font>

504
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,410
<font color="yellow">What do you want to see, Grandma?</font>

505
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,680
<font color="yellow">Becoming a doctor? I'll do it, okay?</font>

506
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,930
<font color="yellow">That's fine.</font>

507
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,460
<font color="yellow">I'll be happy if you do chores
in the hospital.</font>

508
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,400
<font color="yellow">I'll be back.</font>

509
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,270
<font color="yellow">Transpose the next one.</font>

510
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,880
<font color="yellow">X plus 2y squared minus 5x plus 2y.</font>

511
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,370
<font color="yellow">What is transposing?</font>

512
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,480
<font color="yellow">To replace it.</font>

513
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,270
<font color="yellow">It's a basic in factorization.</font>

514
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,880
<font color="yellow">How do I do it?</font>

515
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,590
<font color="yellow">Oh, this is frustrating.</font>

516
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,880
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize you wouldn't know this.</font>

517
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,820
<font color="yellow">How long have you not been studying for?</font>

518
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,010
<font color="yellow">I can do well if you teach me...
just the beginning.</font>

519
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,720
<font color="yellow">Kids, have some snacks while you study.</font>

520
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,110
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much!</font>

521
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,350
<font color="yellow">Eat lots. Studying takes up
a lot of energy.</font>

522
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,020
<font color="yellow">Wow, you made this all yourself.
You're so lucky, Seo Woo.</font>

523
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,710
<font color="yellow">If I tell my mom that I'm hungry,
she orders take-out.</font>

524
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,630
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung, hurry up and eat.</font>

525
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:26,230
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, can I talk to you for a moment?</font>

526
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,370
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I am so upset!</font>

527
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you so upset
after taking up the snacks?</font>

528
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,360
<font color="yellow">There is nothing to be gained from
giving them snacks.</font>

529
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,690
<font color="yellow">They are still here. Let's talk later.</font>

530
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,660
<font color="yellow">What do you mean later?</font>

531
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,180
<font color="yellow">Are you protecting them because
you consider them friends?</font>

532
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,560
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with Soon Hee?</font>

533
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,310
<font color="yellow">Why is a principal's daughter like that?</font>

534
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,600
<font color="yellow">Her book is full of
nothing but scribbles.</font>

535
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,160
<font color="yellow">She's a nice girl.</font>

536
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,790
<font color="yellow">If she's nice, that's halfway there.</font>

537
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,260
<font color="yellow">As long as your friends don't betray you,
that's the most important thing.</font>

538
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,940
<font color="yellow">Your expectations of people are so low.</font>

539
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,650
<font color="yellow">You should tell her to meet people
she can benefit from.</font>

540
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,800
<font color="yellow">We are quite well-off.</font>

541
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,890
<font color="yellow">It's enough to meet people
who don't take from us.</font>

542
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,190
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, your dad trusts you.</font>

543
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,230
<font color="yellow">Stay healthy and study hard.</font>

544
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,120
<font color="yellow">You're always the good guy
in front of our daughter.</font>

545
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,160
<font color="yellow">Besides Soon Hee, who's the other girl?</font>

546
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,310
<font color="yellow">Just stop it. Don't you have any manners?</font>

547
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,540
<font color="yellow">We can talk about this once they leave.</font>

548
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,250
<font color="yellow">Why can't I even speak in my own home?</font>

549
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:26,160
<font color="yellow"><i>All your competitors
are in Gangnam right now.</i></font>

550
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,000
<font color="yellow"><i>If you end up at a bad college,
who will end up being blamed?</i></font>

551
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,520
<font color="yellow"><i>It's me.</i></font>

552
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,030
<font color="yellow"><i>So, this isn't for me.
It's all for you.</i></font>

553
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,190
<font color="yellow">The house is nice,
but it's not very soundproof.</font>

554
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,310
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we should go.</font>

555
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,920
<font color="yellow">- We should go.
- Let's.</font>

556
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,120
<font color="yellow">We'll get going.</font>

557
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,770
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

558
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:58,070
<font color="yellow">Just memorize it if you don't know it.
Math is memorization.</font>

559
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,690
<font color="yellow">These are questions my tutor gave me.</font>

560
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,120
<font color="yellow">How can you give me this?</font>

561
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,900
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's my only copy?
I have other copies.</font>

562
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,400
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

563
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,610
<font color="yellow">When it's meal time, just eat.</font>

564
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,540
<font color="yellow">- Hey, seriously?
- What?</font>

565
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,750
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello!</font>

566
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,630
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

567
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,950
<font color="yellow">You're doing all sorts of things now.</font>

568
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,450
<font color="yellow">What kind of grade is a success?</font>

569
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,200
<font color="yellow">If you're ranked within 30,
it's a success.</font>

570
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,430
<font color="yellow">It it going well?</font>

571
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,660
<font color="yellow">I will only beat up one person. Math.</font>

572
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,340
<font color="yellow">Oh... thank you.</font>

573
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,160
<font color="yellow">Do you have a straw?</font>

574
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,080
<font color="yellow">You don't have much sense.</font>

575
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,360
<font color="yellow">You can't take it back
after giving it to me.</font>

576
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,650
<font color="yellow">Teacher!</font>

577
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,320
<font color="yellow">Let's stop now.</font>

578
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,820
<font color="yellow">Collect it starting from the back.</font>

579
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,920
<font color="yellow">It's not that one.</font>

580
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,430
<font color="yellow">Our marks are coming out today.
I'm so dead!</font>

581
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,060
<font color="yellow">You scared me!</font>

582
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,630
<font color="yellow">You didn't scare me.</font>

583
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:59,140
<font color="yellow">I guess Seo Woo's in a good mood
because she did well on the test.</font>

584
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,950
<font color="yellow">You're probably in first place.</font>

585
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,190
<font color="yellow">It was so hard this time, right?</font>

586
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,820
<font color="yellow">You can't give up on studying
even if you didn't do well, okay?</font>

587
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,500
<font color="yellow">Studying is about keeping
your butt in the seat, not your brain.</font>

588
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,640
<font color="yellow">I will keep that in mind, Teacher.</font>

589
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:13,480
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Let's go!</font>

590
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,010
<font color="yellow">I was really shocked
after I saw the test results.</font>

591
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:24,110
<font color="yellow">- Yoo Hye Jung.
- Yes?</font>

592
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,680
<font color="yellow">Did you do anything wrong?</font>

593
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,480
<font color="yellow">You did something very wrong.
Think about it.</font>

594
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,730
<font color="yellow">I heard the math test was very hard.</font>

595
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:35,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was so hard!</font>

596
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,800
<font color="yellow">The number one for math is in our class.</font>

597
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:43,380
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

598
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,780
<font color="yellow">Do you still not know what you did wrong?</font>

599
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,620
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

600
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,950
<font color="yellow">You did too well, that's what.</font>

601
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,510
<font color="yellow">You are in first place.</font>

602
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,590
<font color="yellow">That's so awesome!</font>

603
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,560
<font color="yellow">At first, even I couldn't believe it.</font>

604
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,660
<font color="yellow">Everyone was suspicious, but not me.</font>

605
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,870
<font color="yellow">I saw how hard you studied.</font>

606
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,260
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

607
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,580
<font color="yellow">Studying is something
you have to be born with.</font>

608
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,060
<font color="yellow">I heard that Hye Jung from your class
placed first for this math test.</font>

609
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,500
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Didn't you tutor her in math?</font>

610
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,020
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- Looks like you raised a tiger.</font>

611
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,210
<font color="yellow">I heard that her IQ is 156.</font>

612
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,250
<font color="yellow">What did you get this time?</font>

613
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:49,950
<font color="yellow">You stay up all night
taking pills to study.</font>

614
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,890
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

615
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,980
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

616
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,100
<font color="yellow">What are you thanking me for?
It was your hard work that did it.</font>

617
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:13,030
<font color="yellow">So, you've succeeded now.</font>

618
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,700
<font color="yellow">Are you here to ask me how
you should live your life differently?</font>

619
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,480
<font color="yellow">No, I already am.</font>

620
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,040
<font color="yellow">I teach you one thing and you learn two.</font>

621
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:23,950
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

622
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,140
<font color="yellow">Preparing for the juniors' class.</font>

623
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,320
<font color="yellow">- Us?
- Yes.</font>

624
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,930
<font color="yellow">What's your blood type?</font>

625
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,630
<font color="yellow">It's probably O.</font>

626
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,000
<font color="yellow">What do you mean "probably"?
It either is or it isn't.</font>

627
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,210
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

628
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,180
<font color="yellow">Sterilize your fingertip.</font>

629
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,490
<font color="yellow">Then get a drop of blood.</font>

630
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,990
<font color="yellow">Put it on these two spots.</font>

631
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,710
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know
what your blood type is.</font>

632
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,400
<font color="yellow">It stings.</font>

633
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,010
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

634
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,880
<font color="yellow">You're type A.</font>

635
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:17,090
<font color="yellow">If your blood forms a cohesion with this
A antiserum, you're type A.</font>

636
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,130
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

637
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,230
<font color="yellow">It's not the same on this one.</font>

638
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,110
<font color="yellow">Wow, really.</font>

639
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,830
<font color="yellow">That's really simple.</font>

640
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,730
<font color="yellow">Do you want to see
your red blood cells too?</font>

641
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,800
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

642
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,230
<font color="yellow">What's your blood type?</font>

643
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,770
<font color="yellow">B.</font>

644
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,450
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

645
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,970
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

646
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,120
<font color="yellow">You have to put your eyes like this.</font>

647
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,200
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

648
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,310
<font color="yellow">Do you see it?</font>

649
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,990
<font color="yellow">Can you not see it?</font>

650
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,900
<font color="yellow">I can see it.</font>

651
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,260
<font color="yellow">Fun, right? You want to learn about it.</font>

652
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,630
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

653
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,670
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

654
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,650
<font color="yellow">- Grandma.
- What?</font>

655
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:11,370
<font color="yellow">- Grandma!
- What is it?</font>

656
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:13,950
<font color="yellow">I got first place in math.</font>

657
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,820
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

658
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,330
<font color="yellow">Really! Really, really.</font>

659
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

660
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,070
<font color="yellow">Oh, good job, my child.</font>

661
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,460
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you.</font>

662
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,750
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

663
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,060
<font color="yellow">I'm happy so why do I keep crying?</font>

664
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,550
<font color="yellow">You should laugh if you're happy.
Why are you crying?</font>

665
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,380
<font color="yellow">That's not good.
Don't do that. Don't.</font>

666
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying, Grandma?</font>

667
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,900
<font color="yellow">Because I'm happy.</font>

668
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,960
<font color="yellow">Oh, my child! Oh dear!</font>

669
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,070
<font color="yellow">My granddaughter is number one!</font>

670
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,960
<font color="yellow"><i>[HYE JUNG]</i></font>

671
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,530
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

672
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Teacher.</font>

673
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,110
<font color="yellow">- This...
- I don't need it.</font>

674
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,920
<font color="yellow">I don't need it anymore either.</font>

675
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,940
<font color="yellow">I memorized it all like you said.</font>

676
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,390
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

677
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,260
<font color="yellow">I won't forget the warmth
you showed me and I'll repay you.</font>

678
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,360
<font color="yellow">Do you like our homeroom teacher?</font>

679
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,060
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering?</font>

680
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,610
<font color="yellow">I'll put it another way.</font>

681
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:46,440
<font color="yellow">Does our homeroom teacher like you?</font>

682
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,690
<font color="yellow">I don't think Teacher and I can be
put into a category like that.</font>

683
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,560
<font color="yellow">Category?</font>

684
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,690
<font color="yellow">You know terms like that?</font>

685
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,440
<font color="yellow">You lied to me, right?</font>

686
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,880
<font color="yellow">- About what?
- Being bad at studying.</font>

687
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,100
<font color="yellow">You fooled me, right?</font>

688
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,480
<font color="yellow">There's no other way you'd
suddenly be so good at it.</font>

689
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,290
<font color="yellow">I never lied to you.</font>

690
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:10,190
<font color="yellow">I've never studied before.</font>

691
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,380
<font color="yellow">So, that means you're just really smart.</font>

692
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:18,520
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why
you're getting so angry.</font>

693
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,060
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I don't know why I'm
getting so angry either.</font>

694
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you know how to ride a bike?</font>

695
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,820
<font color="yellow">Ready, go!</font>

696
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,210
<font color="yellow">It's dangerous!</font>

697
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want to win?</font>

698
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:16,680
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Then, win.</font>

699
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,530
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung wins!</font>

700
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,020
<font color="yellow">It's raining.</font>

701
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,170
<font color="yellow">It's like a movie.</font>

702
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:10,770
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

703
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,750
<font color="yellow">How did you...</font>

704
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,250
<font color="yellow">I've become friendly with
the owner of the CD store.</font>

705
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,590
<font color="yellow">He got that for me.</font>

706
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,790
<font color="yellow">Grandma gave me money for getting
first place so I bought that.</font>

707
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,040
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

708
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,110
<font color="yellow">You have good sense.</font>

709
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:32,020
<font color="yellow">I was really envious of you that day.</font>

710
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,780
<font color="yellow">You should do it too if you're envious.</font>

711
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,230
<font color="yellow">I need to have really top grades
to become a doctor.</font>

712
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:40,580
<font color="yellow">How can I do that?
I was just lucky this time.</font>

713
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,220
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

714
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,880
<font color="yellow">Things don't always work out
just because you work hard.</font>

715
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,180
<font color="yellow">You were just lucky.</font>

716
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:57,620
<font color="yellow">I was by my mom's side
when she was dying.</font>

717
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,010
<font color="yellow">How nice would it have been
if I were a doctor back then?</font>

718
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,720
<font color="yellow">Then she could have lived
like that pregnant woman.</font>

719
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,600
<font color="yellow">Or it would have been really great
if you had been there.</font>

720
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:17,190
<font color="yellow">People who are meant to die will die
even if doctors are there.</font>

721
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,550
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, everyone would live
if they went to the hospital.</font>

722
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,040
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

723
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,640
<font color="yellow">It stopped raining.
Let's go to school. We'll be late.</font>

724
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,730
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

725
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,980
<font color="yellow">They're coming to school together again.</font>

726
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,740
<font color="yellow">Look at the chemistry between them.</font>

727
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,540
<font color="yellow">Are the two of them dating or something?</font>

728
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,060
<font color="yellow">No, why would you imagine such a thing?</font>

729
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,510
<font color="yellow">We're still just teenagers.
It's the most innocent time in our lives.</font>

730
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,510
<font color="yellow">Why are you denying something
right in front of our eyes?</font>

731
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:07,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, we are teenagers.</font>

732
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,790
<font color="yellow">Biologically, we are at
our peak physical state.</font>

733
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:17,040
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- I'm going to post it online.</font>

734
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,410
<font color="yellow">I'll take that temporarily.</font>

735
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,170
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

736
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing all the way here?</font>

737
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,580
<font color="yellow">It's been decided.</font>

738
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,790
<font color="yellow">Am I going up to Seoul? Starting when?</font>

739
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,360
<font color="yellow">- Next month.
- That soon?</font>

740
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,790
<font color="yellow">Meet with people before you come
and get in favor with them.</font>

741
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,910
<font color="yellow">I've set things up for you,
so it's up to you now.</font>

742
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:41,650
<font color="yellow">Father!</font>

743
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,360
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

744
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,440
<font color="yellow">I will get it done!
I won't let you down.</font>

745
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,010
<font color="yellow">Let's have a nice dinner tonight.</font>

746
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:52,500
<font color="yellow">- Bring Seo Woo and your wife.
- Yes.</font>

747
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:16,520
<font color="yellow">We're done for the day.

What do you want to confirm?</font>

754
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,150
<font color="yellow">Just tell me you're jealous of her.
Then I'll understand.</font>
