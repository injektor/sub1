<font color="yellow">at the other hospital, but it's different here.</font>

305
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,090
<font color="yellow">- You sound so sure of it.
-  It's because of the way you act!</font>

306
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,760
<font color="yellow">I don't really like people with showmanship.</font>

307
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,360
<font color="yellow">Let's find out at the conference.</font>

308
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,030
<font color="yellow">Whether the patient actually needed an emergency surgery...</font>

309
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,760
<font color="yellow">or you just jumped on it to show off.</font>

310
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,590
<font color="yellow">Please decide whether you'll use honorifics or not and stick to it.</font>

311
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,790
<font color="yellow">I guess you can't let things slide if they bother you even just a bit.</font>

312
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,830
<font color="yellow">That's like me.</font>

313
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,990
<font color="yellow">Honorifics or not.</font>

314
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,960
<font color="yellow">I'll be mixing it up.</font>

315
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,490
<font color="yellow">Let's stick to that.</font>

316
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,560
<font color="yellow">If you performed the surgery when there was enough time to wait,</font>

317
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,660
<font color="yellow">you'll have to take responsibility that comes with it.</font>

318
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

319
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,290
<font color="yellow">If it gets proven that the emergency surgery was necessary,</font>

320
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,770
<font color="yellow">you'll have to apologise to me.</font>

321
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,790
<font color="yellow">Are you making a deal with me now?</font>

322
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not under your guidance, and I also apologised to you.</font>

323
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,830
<font color="yellow">I think you're out of line.</font>

324
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,730
<font color="yellow">You said you hate people who do things they have to apologise for,</font>

325
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,520
<font color="yellow">but it looks like you'll have to apologise if that happens.</font>

326
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,440
<font color="yellow">The fact that you're behaving this way...</font>

327
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,990
<font color="yellow">shows that you're not interested in becoming a staff member here.</font>

328
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,100
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here if that is the case?</font>

329
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,630
<font color="yellow">You said that you don't want to know anything about my personal stuff.</font>

330
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,660
<font color="yellow">I did,</font>

331
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,330
<font color="yellow">but I changed my mind because I'm capricious.</font>

332
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,490
<font color="yellow">Let's hear it.</font>

333
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,320
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you're here if you don't want to become a staff member.</font>

334
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,490
<font color="yellow">I don't want to tell anyone who isn't close to me...</font>

335
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
<font color="yellow">about my personal stuff and the way I feel.</font>

336
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,460
<font color="yellow">Then I won't be able to find out for the rest of my life...</font>

337
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,660
<font color="yellow">because you and I will never become close.</font>

338
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,460
<font color="yellow">Your door is open. You didn't go the night duty room...</font>

339
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,630
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow then.</font>

340
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,890
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I didn't know you had a guest.</font>

341
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,330
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We're done now.</font>

342
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

343
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,490
<font color="yellow">We've met before, haven't we?</font>

344
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,290
<font color="yellow">You two should introduce yourselves.</font>

345
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,100
<font color="yellow">This is the new fellow, Dr Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

346
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,890
<font color="yellow">- This is...
-  Yoo Hye Jung?</font>

347
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,960
<font color="yellow">You're the Yoo Hye Jung I know?</font>

348
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,100
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's me, Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

349
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,360
<font color="yellow">You're a doctor now?</font>

350
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,490
<font color="yellow">Does seeing me still anger you?</font>

351
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,660
<font color="yellow">Do you know each other?</font>

352
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,260
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

353
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
<font color="yellow">What's your intention for coming here?</font>

354
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,940
<font color="yellow">Many doctors want to work at Gukil Medical Center.</font>

355
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,660
<font color="yellow">That fact alone is enough to explain why I'm here.</font>

356
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,100
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this. How can you be a doctor?</font>

357
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,190
<font color="yellow">How can you work at the same hospital as me? Well...</font>

358
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,130
<font color="yellow">How can someone like you be at the same level as me?</font>

359
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,650
<font color="yellow">So is the fact that I've become successful making you livid?</font>

360
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,100
<font color="yellow">Then did you expect me to congratulate you?</font>

361
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,230
<font color="yellow">Do people here know that you used to be a bully?</font>

362
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,790
<font color="yellow">Did your co-workers at the other hospital know?</font>

363
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,290
<font color="yellow">I neither advertise nor hide it.</font>

364
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,130
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you going to post about it on social media this time?</font>

365
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,020
<font color="yellow">That's your specialty.</font>

366
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,650
<font color="yellow">You excel in ruining people's lives by using the invisible majority.</font>

367
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,330
<font color="yellow">Hadn't I done what I did,</font>

368
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,460
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong's life would've been doomed because of you.</font>

369
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,560
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

370
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,860
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

371
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,230
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come this far if it weren't for you.</font>

372
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,760
<font color="yellow">Anger was my motivation for success.</font>

373
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,430
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me ask you one thing then.</font>

374
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,530
<font color="yellow">Do you still talk to Mr Hong?</font>

375
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,560
<font color="yellow">I've been too busy to be able to reminisce people in my past.</font>

376
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,600
<font color="yellow">You're lying again.</font>

377
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,640
<font color="yellow">You used to lie to me and fool me, telling me you didn't study at all.</font>

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,360
<font color="yellow">How can you believe whatever you're thinking as facts?</font>

379
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,890
<font color="yellow">Is everything a lie when you can't understand it?</font>

380
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,360
<font color="yellow">You know that Mr Hong will start working here next week, don't you?</font>

381
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,930
<font color="yellow">You must've come here knowing that.</font>

382
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,600
<font color="yellow">No matter what I tell you, you won't believe me.</font>

383
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,160
<font color="yellow">Leave this hospital.</font>

384
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,230
<font color="yellow">Then I'll believe you.</font>

385
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,290
<font color="yellow">I will walk out whenever I choose.</font>

386
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,060
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong married In Joo.</font>

387
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,490
<font color="yellow">He's a married man now. Don't even think about it.</font>

388
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my wrist?</font>

389
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,990
<font color="yellow">Have you been checked?</font>

390
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,330
<font color="yellow">Stop flirting.</font>

391
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,560
<font color="yellow">I'm aware that you've been staring for a while.</font>

392
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,410
<font color="yellow">You're both overly aggressive...</font>

393
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,930
<font color="yellow">and more defensive than necessary.</font>

394
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,140
<font color="yellow">How long has your hand shaken like that?</font>

395
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,460
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to know?</font>

396
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,900
<font color="yellow">Are you a doctor or something?</font>

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

398
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

399
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,570
<font color="yellow">Peripheral nerves can be temporarily stimulated...</font>

400
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,630
<font color="yellow">to cause the hands to tremble.</font>

401
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,830
<font color="yellow">But brain malfunctions can also be the cause.</font>

402
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,960
<font color="yellow">I am only 25 years old.</font>

403
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,160
<font color="yellow">I'm too young for brain malfunctions.</font>

404
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,270
<font color="yellow">I know you're a doctor, but aren't you overstepping your boundary?</font>

405
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,390
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

406
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,600
<font color="yellow">I think it's a basic trait that all doctors need to possess.</font>

407
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,190
<font color="yellow">You're a smooth talker, aren't you?</font>

408
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,660
<font color="yellow">I think you would've made a great news anchor too.</font>

409
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,830
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry if I offended you.</font>

410
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,090
<font color="yellow">Miss!</font>

411
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,890
<font color="yellow">I need a cushion.</font>

412
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,750
<font color="yellow">Are you a doctor?</font>

413
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,230
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm a licensed neurosurgeon.</font>

414
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,160
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a first-aid kit?
-  Yes.</font>

415
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,170
<font color="yellow">There should be Lorazepam inside. I need it quickly, please.</font>

416
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,190
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

417
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,530
<font color="yellow">Please hold her down.</font>

418
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,490
<font color="yellow">When will we be landing?</font>

419
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,630
<font color="yellow">She doesn't have much time.</font>

420
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,210
<font color="yellow">Have you contacted the emergency centre at Gukil Medical Center?</font>

421
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,600
<font color="yellow">Yes, emergency response will be waiting at arrival.</font>

422
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,630
<font color="yellow">She needs to be on the operating table within four and a half hours.</font>

423
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,030
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, she'll die.</font>

424
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

425
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,610
<font color="yellow">Please talk to me. How do you feel?</font>

426
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,090
<font color="yellow">Of course I don't feel good.</font>

427
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,130
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm here.</font>

428
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,830
<font color="yellow">Based on your statements, the surgery seems to be a success.</font>

429
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,630
<font color="yellow">How could "not feeling good" be a success?</font>

430
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,960
<font color="yellow">You are a whiner, aren't you?</font>

431
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,360
<font color="yellow">It's funny to hear someone who lives off bothering others whine.</font>

432
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,590
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to kill me by making my brain rupture with anger?</font>

433
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,330
<font color="yellow">Even if the surgery goes well, the surgical site can bleed out.</font>

434
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,930
<font color="yellow">You can fall unconscious, develop a speech impediment,</font>

435
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,030
<font color="yellow">become paralysed or have a seizure. Those are the risks.</font>

436
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,740
<font color="yellow">But since I can see you whining,</font>

437
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,930
<font color="yellow">I'm happy that you're okay.</font>

438
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,390
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me that from the get-go?</font>

439
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,110
<font color="yellow">Observe him a bit longer and get a CT scan if there are anomalies.</font>

440
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,730
<font color="yellow">If his status doesn't fluctuate, move him to a room.</font>

441
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
<font color="yellow">Will do.</font>

442
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,130
<font color="yellow">Get some rest, Boss. I have to run along.</font>

443
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,590
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

444
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,530
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

445
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,630
<font color="yellow">I said thank you.</font>

446
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,610
<font color="yellow">I couldn't hear him. What did he say?</font>

447
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,630
<font color="yellow">He said thank you.</font>

448
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,330
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

449
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,160
<font color="yellow">Thank you for waking up.</font>

450
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,160
<font color="yellow">You pretended not to hear what I said, didn't you?</font>

451
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,930
<font color="yellow">Of course, it took a lot of effort to earn that.</font>

<font color="yellow">I have to confirm your skills before I trust you completely.</font>

592
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,730

593
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,260
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing?</font>

594
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,860

<font color="yellow">Is asking for something the first thing you do after our reunion?</font>

602
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,540

<font color="yellow">You mentioned that he was young with a stable mental state.</font>

755
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,080
<font color="yellow">If he regained consciousness after his convulsions,</font>

756
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,230
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you have waited to observe his condition?</font>

757
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,290
<font color="yellow">Those moments of recovery were lucid intervals.</font>

758
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,190
<font color="yellow">I decided on surgery after the patient fell into stupor again.</font>

759
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,820
<font color="yellow">According to the CT scan,</font>

760
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,710
<font color="yellow">the haematoma shouldn't have affected his mental state.</font>

761
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,490
<font color="yellow">Maybe there was an error with his mental assessment.</font>

762
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,120
<font color="yellow">There was no mistake.</font>

763
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,640
<font color="yellow">Then the cause of the patient's stupor must be something else.</font>

764
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,560
<font color="yellow">The scans should've been consulted if his condition was worsening.</font>

765
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,820
<font color="yellow">The operating field revealed a continual haemorrhage...</font>

766
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,280
<font color="yellow">from a ruptured middle meningeal artery.</font>

767
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,360
<font color="yellow">The extracted haematoma exceeded 50cc.</font>

768
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,390
<font color="yellow">The operating field is a surgeon's discretionary domain.</font>

769
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:02,600
<font color="yellow">If your suspicions continue,</font>

770
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,430
<font color="yellow">I cannot no longer reveal the details behind my decision.</font>

771
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,460
<font color="yellow">That is correct, the operating field is under a surgeon's discretion.</font>

772
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,660
<font color="yellow">If we don't respect our professional boundaries,</font>

773
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,560
<font color="yellow">no one else will.</font>

774
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,290
<font color="yellow">Let's wrap it up now.</font>

775
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,530
<font color="yellow">I'd like to introduce someone to you.</font>

776
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,330
<font color="yellow">Professor Hong Ji Hong.</font>

777
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
<font color="yellow">Come on out.</font>

778
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,230
<font color="yellow">He's joining our department as a staff member.</font>

779
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,730
<font color="yellow">I'm sure all of you have heard about Prof. Hong.</font>

780
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,060
<font color="yellow">He's a world-renowned intracranial tumour expert.</font>

781
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,030
<font color="yellow">I went through hoops to bring him on board.</font>

782
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:56,360
<font color="yellow">I am Hong Ji Hong. It's very nice to meet you all.</font>

783
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,090
<font color="yellow">Dr Jin Seo Woo.</font>

784
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,570
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
-  Whose guidance are you under now?</font>

785
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,830
<font color="yellow">Dr Jung Yoon Do.</font>

786
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,490
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong and Dr Jung.</font>

787
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,130
<font color="yellow">Decide whom you'd like for your assistant...</font>

788
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:15,960
<font color="yellow">between the two fellows, Dr Yoo and Dr Jin, and let me know.</font>

789
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,990
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo and Dr Jin.</font>

790
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,030
<font color="yellow">If you'd like to be trained by a specific staff member,</font>

791
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,160
<font color="yellow">score some brownie points so that you can be chosen.</font>

792
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm hungry.</font>

793
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,480
<font color="yellow">- Is this usually on Mondays?
-  Yes, usually.</font>

794
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,990
<font color="yellow">- Unless anything special comes up.
-  I see.</font>

795
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,990
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong!</font>

796
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,830
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. It's been a long time.</font>

797
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,790
<font color="yellow">I saw Hye Jung too. What's going on?</font>

798
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,590
<font color="yellow">I was very impressed by your thesis on "Neurosurgery".</font>

799
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:04,860
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

800
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:10,230
<font color="yellow">Seeing you guys is making me reminisce the old days.</font>

801
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,030
<font color="yellow">Do you two know each other?</font>

802
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,290
<font color="yellow">She was my student. Dr Yoo too.</font>

803
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,290
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

804
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,190
<font color="yellow">So you taught two neurosurgeons?</font>

805
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:20,590
<font color="yellow">They're making me so proud as their teacher.</font>

806
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,540
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

807
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,560
<font color="yellow">Likewise.</font>

808
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:27,890
<font color="yellow">Dr Jin. Are you trying to lobby him...</font>

809
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,230
<font color="yellow">so that you can work under him?</font>

810
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,430
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even need to because I already know her.</font>

811
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,230
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you want to work under me.</font>

812
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,640
<font color="yellow">I still have a lot to learn from Dr Jung.</font>

813
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,660
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

814
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,490
<font color="yellow">Let's have fun working together.</font>

815
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,130
<font color="yellow">That'd be great.</font>

816
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,790
<font color="yellow">You have to maintain a good relationship with Prof. Hong.</font>

817
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,930
<font color="yellow">I know that you have good rapports with everyone,</font>

818
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:53,230
<font color="yellow">but there's something I'm planning that involves him.</font>

819
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:57,560
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

820
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,590
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

821
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,990
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

822
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,730
<font color="yellow">I'd like to talk to you about something.</font>

823
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,960
<font color="yellow">(Office of Vice President)</font>

824
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,230
<font color="yellow">I'd like to know why you recruited Dr Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

825
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,460
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be biased against her education,</font>

826
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,660
<font color="yellow">but she went to a third-rate university and...</font>

827
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,590
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't criticise her based on her education.</font>

828
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,830
<font color="yellow">As you know, your father Dr Jin Myung Hoon...</font>

829
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,660
<font color="yellow">is running Gukil Medical Center despite graduating...</font>

830
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,160
<font color="yellow">from a university outside of Seoul.</font>

831
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,720
<font color="yellow">When we hire fellows here, we strictly look at...</font>

832
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,790
<font color="yellow">their talent as doctors.</font>

833
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,930
<font color="yellow">And that makes Dr Yoo a good fit for the role.</font>

834
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,960
<font color="yellow">She was already working as a staff member at another hospital.</font>

835
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,660
<font color="yellow">She must have an ulterior motive for choosing to come here.</font>

836
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,890
<font color="yellow">I'm curious about it as well.</font>

837
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,630
<font color="yellow">Why did Dr Yoo follow me?</font>

838
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,390
<font color="yellow">Being a successful staff member at that age isn't an easy thing.</font>

839
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,390
<font color="yellow">She'll also make a lot less here.</font>

840
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,430
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo. You're not seeing any outpatients today, right?</font>

841
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:56,990
<font color="yellow">No, I just need to make rounds at the ICU.</font>

842
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,130
<font color="yellow">Whom would you like to be trained by first?</font>

843
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,390
<font color="yellow">I'll just let them choose. I don't want to think about it.</font>

844
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,790
<font color="yellow">You're cool.</font>

845
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,530
<font color="yellow">What's cool?</font>

846
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:10,390
<font color="yellow">Nothing. You're just cool.</font>

847
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:13,660
<font color="yellow">You're making me think of the old days.</font>

848
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,160
<font color="yellow">I think I treated my teacher in high school...</font>

849
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,730
<font color="yellow">like how you're treating me now.</font>

850
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,730
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not still thinking that I made a wrong decision.</font>

851
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,930
<font color="yellow">I didn't see the operation field with my own eyes.</font>

852
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:43,530
<font color="yellow">Hence, I can't really apologise.</font>

853
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,960
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be difficult, but you're actually not.</font>

854
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,890
<font color="yellow">Are you insulting me right now?</font>

855
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:50,960
<font color="yellow">Being persistent like that makes you look so childish.</font>

856
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,780
<font color="yellow">I was nervous thinking that you'd be difficult,</font>

857
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,360
<font color="yellow">but it looks like I can relax a little.</font>

858
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,290
<font color="yellow">- I beg your pardon?
-  Even if you didn't witness it,</font>

859
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:00,160
<font color="yellow">you should still trust people more.</font>

860
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:03,260
<font color="yellow">What you just did made you look so lame.</font>

861
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,660
<font color="yellow">She called him lame.</font>

862
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,130
<font color="yellow">Who are you really?</font>

863
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,130
<font color="yellow">You beat up that gangsters. Do you think you're one of them?</font>

864
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,560
<font color="yellow">Why are you speaking so harshly?</font>

865
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you so rude to me?</font>

866
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,430
<font color="yellow">You were rude to me first.</font>

867
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,560
<font color="yellow">I always give back what I get.</font>

868
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:29,860
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo.</font>

869
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,390
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about the extradural haemorrhage surgery.</font>

870
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:47,560
<font color="yellow">Now we're equal.</font>

871
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,130
<font color="yellow">For your information,</font>

872
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,360
<font color="yellow">I also always make sure to give back what I get.</font>

873
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,660
<font color="yellow">What if it's because of Prof. Hong?</font>

874
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,260
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong?</font>

875
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,510
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you any more because it concerns her privacy.</font>

876
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:11,420
<font color="yellow">However, I trust that letting Dr Yoo go...</font>

877
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,930
<font color="yellow">would be the best thing for the Department of Neurosurgery.</font>

878
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,490
<font color="yellow">Are you intimidated by Dr Yoo?</font>

879
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,030
<font color="yellow">Are you scared?</font>

880
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,330
<font color="yellow">Why would I be?</font>

881
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:20,860
<font color="yellow">The girl who comes from poor family and some unknown college...</font>

882
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,130
<font color="yellow">is now at the same position as you.</font>

883
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:29,200
<font color="yellow">You come from the family of three-generation-long doctors.</font>

884
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,290
<font color="yellow">So relax.</font>

885
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,760
<font color="yellow">People can't grow alone.</font>

886
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,630
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo will become a good competitor.</font>

887
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,230
<font color="yellow">You are aware that they are hiring professors next year, right?</font>

888
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,860
<font color="yellow">There's only one spot.</font>

889
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,130
<font color="yellow">You made Dr Yoo my rival.</font>

890
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,530
<font color="yellow">I will show you that you've made a mistake.</font>

891
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,130
<font color="yellow">Saying that you have private matters you can't talk about is...</font>

892
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,790
<font color="yellow">much more of a personal attack than saying that there are private...</font>

893
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,360
<font color="yellow">matters you can talk about.</font>

894
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,490
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had that side.</font>

900
