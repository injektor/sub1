it can change you.</i></font>

can change my life.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>It can be a source of hope
for a person... or despair.</i></font>

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,780
<font color="yellow">You asked me if I trust you?</font>

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,380
<font color="yellow">As a doctor, I trust you.</font>

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,190
<font color="yellow">Should I bow down in thanks?</font>

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,950
<font color="yellow">As a patient's guardian,
I don't trust you.</font>

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,490
<font color="yellow">If this surgery goes wrong...</font>

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,930
<font color="yellow">I will kill you.</font>

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,020
<font color="yellow">Even if you try,
I will live a long life.</font>

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="yellow">Until I grow very old.</font>

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,130
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,150
<font color="yellow">I really didn't like you before, Doctor.</font>

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:58,720
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit of a show off,
but you're pretty bad yourself.</font>

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,890
<font color="yellow">But I think I like you a bit more today.</font>

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,040
<font color="yellow">Is that a compliment?</font>

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
<font color="yellow">It is a compliment.</font>

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,920
<font color="yellow">We're rivals over one woman.</font>

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,260
<font color="yellow">Have you even had a meal in the cafeteria
with Hye Jung before saying this?</font>

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,780
<font color="yellow">Well, we're going to eat soon.</font>

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,010
<font color="yellow">Eat first before
calling yourself a rival.</font>

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is he poking my weak spot?</font>

25
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,340
<font color="yellow">You came out of nowhere, as usual.</font>

26
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,120
<font color="yellow">Doctor, your hand is really big.</font>

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah?</font>

28
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,140
<font color="yellow">I think I can absorb your entire head.</font>

29
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,370
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

30
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,020
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

31
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,340
<font color="yellow">Let's walk a bit.</font>

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,850
<font color="yellow">You're being very good to me today.</font>

33
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
<font color="yellow">What is all of this?</font>

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,000
<font color="yellow">Oh, give it to Teacher Hong.</font>

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,330
<font color="yellow">I prepared it with the heart
of a mother-in-law.</font>

36
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,210
<font color="yellow">It's chicken stew that's really healthy.</font>

37
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,520
<font color="yellow">You're really...</font>

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,720
<font color="yellow">I'm really great, right?</font>

39
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,570
<font color="yellow">However, this is not free.</font>

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,920
<font color="yellow">Correct!</font>

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,610
<font color="yellow">Hey, what do you expect me to do?</font>

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,770
<font color="yellow">You don't need to do anything.
Just send him to my store.</font>

44
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,180
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the rest.</font>

45
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,400
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,160
<font color="yellow">- Yum. It's so good.
- Right?</font>

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,400
<font color="yellow">Seriously, you make me do
the strangest things.</font>

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,430
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, my pretty child!</font>

50
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,500
<font color="yellow">How do you always know
exactly what I need?</font>

51
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,230
<font color="yellow">Teacher Hong wasn't only your teacher.</font>

52
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,690
<font color="yellow">He was my homeroom teacher.</font>

53
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,700
<font color="yellow">Once my teacher, always my teacher!</font>

54
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,710
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

55
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,820
<font color="yellow">I thought you were serious.</font>

56
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,390
<font color="yellow">- I was joking.
- Stop eating that.</font>

57
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,920
<font color="yellow">Bon appetit.</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[YOO HYE JUNG]</i></font>

59
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,200
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Hye Jung.</font>

60
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,890
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah?</font>

61
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,540
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you my pin,
so go in and wait for me.</font>

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,300
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

63
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,660
<font color="yellow">- When are we going to eat together?
- What?</font>

64
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,460
<font color="yellow">You don't even remember?</font>

65
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,540
<font color="yellow">We are supposed to eat
in the cafeteria together.</font>

66
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,850
<font color="yellow">That was so long ago and
we still haven't eaten yet.</font>

67
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,040
<font color="yellow">Then should we have lunch together today?</font>

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,950
<font color="yellow">Sounds good.</font>

69
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,270
<font color="yellow">What? Why are you laughing?</font>

70
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,140
<font color="yellow">You're just funny, Doctor.</font>

71
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,900
<font color="yellow">Don't get ahead of yourself, heart.</font>

72
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,590
<font color="yellow"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,410
<font color="yellow">Put that down!</font>

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,110
<font color="yellow">Don't touch a thing.</font>

75
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,550
<font color="yellow">It might look like a mess,
but there is an order to everything.</font>

76
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,450
<font color="yellow">Did you wait long?</font>

77
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,760
<font color="yellow">No. You haven't had
breakfast yet, right?</font>

78
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,610
<font color="yellow">Of course not. What is this?</font>

79
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,270
<font color="yellow">Soon Hee wanted me to give this to you.</font>

80
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,880
<font color="yellow">Soon Hee? Not you?</font>

81
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,680
<font color="yellow">I wanted to bring it for you too.</font>

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,120
<font color="yellow">But, we didn't make this for you.
We bought it and warmed it up.</font>

83
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,920
<font color="yellow">You had this side to you?</font>

84
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,300
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do have this side to me.</font>

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,690
<font color="yellow">You may not have known because
I don't show it very often.</font>

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,980
<font color="yellow">First, have some of the soup,
then have some of the meat.</font>

87
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,320
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

88
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,120
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

89
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,220
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be assisting
with your father's surgery.</font>

90
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,330
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

91
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,500
<font color="yellow">Did you find your grandma's
anesthesia records?</font>

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,170
<font color="yellow"><i>How can he worry about me
at a time like this?</i></font>

93
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,130
<font color="yellow">You're not answering me again.</font>

94
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,690
<font color="yellow">Records that are over
10 years old are destroyed.</font>

95
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,740
<font color="yellow">So, what happened?</font>

96
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,620
<font color="yellow">The doctor who filled out my grandma's
records is still at the branch hospital.</font>

97
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,140
<font color="yellow">He's a section chief there and
I'm going to hear it from him.</font>

98
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:56,690
<font color="yellow">Why are you so certain that
the doctors made a mistake?</font>

99
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,850
<font color="yellow">It was a cancer that had not spread.</font>

100
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,980
<font color="yellow">If the surgery was successful,
a chance for complete recovery was high.</font>

101
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,040
<font color="yellow">It was a table death, at that.</font>

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,540
<font color="yellow">I found out later that a table death
for stomach cancer is highly unlikely.</font>

103
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,680
<font color="yellow">What about your parents?</font>

104
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,090
<font color="yellow">I think they took a settlement.
They covered it up quickly.</font>

105
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,240
<font color="yellow">Can we work on that assignment together?</font>

106
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,060
<font color="yellow"><i>Take care of yourself first.</i></font>

107
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,770
<font color="yellow">- No, you can't.
- You're very resolute.</font>

108
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,960
<font color="yellow">How many hours a day do you sleep?</font>

109
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,150
<font color="yellow">I sleep a lot.</font>

110
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,560
<font color="yellow">Don't be vague.</font>

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
<font color="yellow">Give me an approximate answer
like I gave you.</font>

112
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,560
<font color="yellow">I sleep at least five hours.
Sometimes, I stay in bed all day.</font>

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,000
<font color="yellow">You're able to focus on
multiple things at once too?</font>

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can.</font>

115
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,580
<font color="yellow">I'm not like you who can
only go after one thing.</font>

116
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,100
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

117
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,100
<font color="yellow">Then, are you happy, Doctor?</font>

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,330
<font color="yellow">I'm happy.</font>

119
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,310
<font color="yellow">How can you be sure that you're happy?</font>

120
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,400
<font color="yellow">I'm alive and I have a person I like.</font>

121
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,870
<font color="yellow">We're eating together like this.
This is happiness.</font>

122
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,850
<font color="yellow">I think you're a really good man
and you're a strong person.</font>

123
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,320
<font color="yellow">What's with you suddenly?
Something's up, right?</font>

124
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,720
<font color="yellow"><i>[DOCTOR JUNG YOON DO]</i></font>

your father's surgery.</font>

127
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,760

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,330

who read it.</font>

131

- His code was used to open it.</font>

132
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,990

or someone connected to him.</font>

133
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,070
<font color="yellow">Look into it further.</font>

134
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,020
<font color="yellow">Also, he has not gone home yet.</font>

135
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,270

136
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,370

211
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,100
<font color="yellow">Are you going to visit him?</font>

212
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,400
<font color="yellow">No, I think he's getting surgery
in secret because of us.</font>

213
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,170
<font color="yellow">He knows that the board members will be
swayed if it's known that he's ill.</font>

214
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,750
<font color="yellow">Kim Tae Ho went too far.</font>

215
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,210
<font color="yellow">He should be penalized for that.
Deputy Director is too much for him.</font>

216
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,580
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should
keep this surgery a secret.</font>

217
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,140
<font color="yellow">It's too much of a burden for you.</font>

218
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,580
<font color="yellow">You'll have to face it
head-on eventually.</font>

219
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,140
<font color="yellow">Yes, I agree.</font>

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,390
<font color="yellow">I lived comfortably until now
being shielded by your father.</font>

221
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,180
<font color="yellow">I think we should let him fish
and do what he enjoys now.</font>

222
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,900
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

223
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,470
<font color="yellow">- I need to go to the ICU.
- Okay.</font>

224
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,010

229
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,380
<font color="yellow">Right. He hasn't had it in two weeks.</font>

230
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,950
<font color="yellow">Okay, it will be this afternoon.

240
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,700
<font color="yellow">Should I bring them to you?</font>

241
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,340
<font color="yellow">No, it's not a secret surgery anymore.</font>

242
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,500
<font color="yellow">Can I use that computer?</font>

243
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,560
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor. I'm done using it.</font>

249
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

250
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,420
<font color="yellow">You're making me feel awkward.
Why are you staring?</font>

251
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,950

The cavernous malformation removal.</font>

258
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,120

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,430

261
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,440

262
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,030

264
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,710
<font color="yellow">- He's getting surgery?
- Yes.</font>

265
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,760
<font color="yellow">The hospital is up in arms about it.</font>

266
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,800
<font color="yellow">Why would Hye Jung do an
important surgery like that?</font>

267
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,260
<font color="yellow">She didn't get it because it's important,
but because it was the right fit.</font>

268
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,700
<font color="yellow">Hey, am I really awful right now?</font>

269
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,130

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,250
<font color="yellow">Let's just pay half each.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why should I pay?</font>

273
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,420
<font color="yellow">You were in the car too, Nurse Hyun.</font>

274
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,470
<font color="yellow">You were the one driving, Doctor.
I thought you had a license.</font>

275
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,250
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo knows everything.</font>

276
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,640
<font color="yellow">She's not saying anything for now,
but we need to come up with a plan.</font>

277
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,670
<font color="yellow">What's going on that you're not even
acknowledging a person?</font>

278
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,950
<font color="yellow">I was just trying to become Cinderella.</font>

279
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,110
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even do that and now
I'm about to lose two months' pay.</font>

280
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,970
<font color="yellow">Just know that I can't pay it.</font>

281
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,220
<font color="yellow">- Hey...
- What's that about?</font>

282
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,290
<font color="yellow">The car that Doctor Yoo got from Boss,
we took it and crashed it.</font>

283
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,390
<font color="yellow">She actually accepted that car?</font>

284
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,140
<font color="yellow">That's accepting bribes.
It's against our hospital rules.</font>

285
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,940
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about that.</font>

286
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,420
<font color="yellow">Nurse Hyun and I are about to
lose months of pay to cover the damage.</font>

287
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,360
<font color="yellow">Isn't there something we can do?</font>

288
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,840
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it.</font>

289
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,570
<font color="yellow">This is Jin Seo Woo from the
Neurosurgery department.</font>

290
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,170
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo Hye Jung from my department
was gifted a car by a patient.</font>

291
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,140
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

292
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

<font color="yellow">You're going to the Science Council
in Jeju Island this year, right?</font>

295
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,670
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I like that about Kim Tae Ho.</font>

296
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,550
<font color="yellow">He helps you grow regardless of me.</font>

297
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,970
<font color="yellow">Here comes that tiger now.</font>

298
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,750
<font color="yellow">I never dreamed that Director Hong
would be admitted to the hospital.</font>

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,130
<font color="yellow">I should have told you earlier,
but I didn't want to worry you.</font>

300
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,500
<font color="yellow">I should worry, of course.</font>

301
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,360
<font color="yellow">Director Hong is such an
important person in our hospital.</font>

302
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,170
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you need?</font>

303
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Gosh, I know I can be fake,
but your pretension is over the top.</i></font>

304
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,440
<font color="yellow">No, your concern is more than enough.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Please do what you can.
- I will.</font>

306
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,290
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange.</font>

307
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:16,440
<font color="yellow">They tried useless methods.</font>

308
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,040
<font color="yellow">No matter what,
the ball will always be in our court.</font>

309
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,390
<font color="yellow">We have been friends for 50 years,
haven't we?</font>

310
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,910
<font color="yellow">I bought the soup that you always liked.</font>

311
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,920
<font color="yellow">Have it after your surgery.</font>

312
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,410
<font color="yellow">How is your face after being punched?</font>

313
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,810
<font color="yellow">It's fine, of course.</font>

314
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,890
<font color="yellow">It takes more than that to hurt me.</font>

315
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,570
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much I'm holding back?</font>

316
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,460
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know
about your slush fund?</font>

317
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,130
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

318
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,680
<font color="yellow">I wanted Myung Hoon to
step down on his own.</font>

319
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,740
<font color="yellow">But now... there is no chance.</font>

320
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,070
<font color="yellow">All right, do it your way.</font>

321
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,640
<font color="yellow">In return, give me the records
for my slush fund.</font>

322
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,210
<font color="yellow">We are friends.</font>

323
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,520
<font color="yellow">No matter what anyone says,
we have a history together.</font>

324
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,230
<font color="yellow">You're sick, so rest.</font>

325
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,010
<font color="yellow">Aren't you sick of it all?
Focusing on work your entire life?</font>

326
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,760
<font color="yellow">Give it to Ji Hong. I'll cooperate.</font>

327
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,410
<font color="yellow">Aren't you even going to say hello?</font>

328
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,250
<font color="yellow">- Have you thought about your mistake?
- Yes.</font>

329
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,440
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.</font>

330
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,160
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, I was your homeroom teacher.</font>

331
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,410
<font color="yellow">Don't forget that.</font>

332
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,060
<font color="yellow">How could I forget that?</font>

333
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,850
<font color="yellow">I genuinely want the best for you.</font>

334
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,410
<font color="yellow">Finally, we are having
that cafeteria meal.</font>

335
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,810
<font color="yellow">Let's sit here.</font>

336
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,350
<font color="yellow">It's really hard to eat a meal with you.</font>

337
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,030
<font color="yellow">Are you usually this quiet?</font>

338
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,540
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

339
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,990
<font color="yellow">Then, is it just me who makes you quiet?</font>

340
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,940
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

341
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,140
<font color="yellow">You're laughing again.</font>

342
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,500
<font color="yellow">I'm like that, you know.</font>

343
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,950
<font color="yellow">If you get to know me well,
I'm a really funny guy.</font>

344
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,830
<font color="yellow">I told you I thought of you as a woman.</font>

345
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,260
<font color="yellow">Did you not fully understand
what I meant?</font>

346
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,480
<font color="yellow">I understood. I'm not that stupid.</font>

347
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,090
<font color="yellow">So why are you putting up walls?</font>

348
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,740
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Doctor Hong Ji Hong?</font>

349
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,170
<font color="yellow">Doctor, we're here to eat.</font>

350
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:18,110
<font color="yellow">This topic is a bit heavy over a meal.</font>

351
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,140
<font color="yellow">Why is it too heavy?
Eating and love...</font>

352
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,120
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that you can
talk about anything while you eat.</font>

353
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,600
<font color="yellow">That's all I'm saying.</font>

354
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,450
<font color="yellow">Doctor... thank you.</font>

355
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,460
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly thanking me?</font>

356
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,370
<font color="yellow">I'm getting a bad feeling.</font>

357
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:42,480
<font color="yellow">This is what people usually say
before they say something bad.</font>

358
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,290
<font color="yellow">I don't believe in love
between men and women.</font>

359
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,650
<font color="yellow">Should I stop?</font>

360
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,000
<font color="yellow">Keep going. Let's finish this.</font>

361
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,000
<font color="yellow">If I were to love someone at all...</font>

362
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,730
<font color="yellow">that one person would be
Doctor Hong Ji Hong.</font>

363
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

364
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,350
<font color="yellow">It's not something to be sorry about.</font>

365
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,170
<font color="yellow">I am thankful that you
feel sorry to me, though.</font>

366
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,910
<font color="yellow">It means that you have
good feelings towards me.</font>

367
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,320
<font color="yellow">Hey, there's no need for you
to get up and leave like that.</font>

368
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,880
<font color="yellow">Let's eat.</font>

369
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,770
<font color="yellow">I guess I am funny even in my own eyes.</font>

370
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,550
<font color="yellow">- Let's get up.
- Okay.</font>

371
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,430
<font color="yellow">This is the Neurosurgery department.</font>

372
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,530
<font color="yellow">What? Yes.</font>

373
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,680
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo Hye Jung?</font>

374
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,050
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

375
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,810
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

376
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,220
<font color="yellow">The internal audit team is looking for
Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

377
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,900
<font color="yellow">If they're looking for her,
she received a bribe.</font>

378
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,060
<font color="yellow">I knew it. She acted so clean
all by herself.</font>

379
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,480
<font color="yellow">Doctor Choi, do you think
this is about that car?</font>

380
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,610
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

381
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,040
<font color="yellow">What if it is? I'd feel so bad.</font>

382
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,730
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- I have to call Doctor Yoo.</font>

383
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,050
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

384
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,530
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

385
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,450
<font color="yellow">Run now and tell Doctor Yoo to
go to the internal audit office.</font>

386
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,610
<font color="yellow">- I can call.
- But then you won't suffer!</font>

387
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,240
<font color="yellow">Run now! Run, run, run!</font>

388

390
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,200
<font color="yellow">Doctor! Oh no.</font>

391
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,330
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

392
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,170
<font color="yellow">You could've called. Why are you running?</font>

393

394

your patient, Gong Byung Doo?</font>

401
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,160
<font color="yellow">No, he left it here for me.</font>

402
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,720
<font color="yellow">I didn't know how to take care of it,
so I needed some time.</font>

<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

405
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,230
<font color="yellow">So, you lied.</font>

406
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,010

<font color="yellow">Get me my reading glasses and pen.</font>

447
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,140
<font color="yellow">Where do I sign?</font>

448
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,690
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- Okay.</font>

449
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,800
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

450
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,680
<font color="yellow">It's your turn.</font>

451
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,460
<font color="yellow">Dad, is this really necessary?</font>

452
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,200
<font color="yellow">I'm only preparing for the very worst.</font>

453
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,870
<font color="yellow">Don't take it too seriously.</font>

454
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,400
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to die.</font>

455
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,210
<font color="yellow">I'm going to retire as
director of the board.</font>

456
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,370
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

457
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,520
<font color="yellow">You think it's good that
I'm going to be unemployed?</font>

458
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,130
<font color="yellow">I'll feed you and take care of you.</font>

459
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,910
<font color="yellow">Once you recover,
you should go on vacations.</font>

460
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,090
<font color="yellow">I use a lot of money, you know.</font>

461
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,900
<font color="yellow">How much monthly allowance
are you going to give me?</font>

462
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,890
<font color="yellow">We have enough money.</font>

463
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,530
<font color="yellow">Look at you backing down right away.</font>

464
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,210
<font color="yellow">Go to bed, Dad.</font>

465
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,600
<font color="yellow">I'll take your glasses.</font>

466
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,920
<font color="yellow">When you're removing the tumor,
check on the facial nerves frequently.</font>

467
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,290
<font color="yellow">Make sure not to damage
any of those nerves.</font>

468
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,480
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

469
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,040
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

470
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,020
<font color="yellow">Use the CUSA to get the
central part of the tumor.</font>

471
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,500
<font color="yellow">You have to be careful not to damage
the lower cranial nerves, as well.</font>

472
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,560
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

473
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

474
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,050
<font color="yellow">The two of you suit each other so well.</font>

475
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,580
<font color="yellow">We are like that.</font>

476
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,820
<font color="yellow">A surgeon must be cool-headed</font>

477
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,590
<font color="yellow">and have a heart that can
withstand all pressure.</font>

478
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,640
<font color="yellow">As well as deft hands.</font>

479
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,240
<font color="yellow">Nice words, right?</font>

480
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,490
<font color="yellow">That's from your book, Doctor.</font>

481
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,780
<font color="yellow">My surgery is in your hands,
Doctor Jung.</font>

482
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,810
<font color="yellow">Do a good job.</font>

483
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:14,960
<font color="yellow">If you don't do a good job,
he might wake up and do it himself.</font>

484
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,870
<font color="yellow">What, Doctor?</font>

485
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,490
<font color="yellow">Stop that now. He might cry.</font>

486
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,000
<font color="yellow">Doctor, how do you feel?</font>

487
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,540
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm just all right.</font>

488
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,530
<font color="yellow">It seemed like you were just laughing.
Weren't you very good, then?</font>

489
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,840
<font color="yellow">Even if I'm laughing,
I'm just all right.</font>

490
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,530
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's not good enough.</font>

491
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,350
<font color="yellow">Doctor, should I do a trick or something?</font>

492
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,870
<font color="yellow">Okay, then sing a song.</font>

493
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,880
<font color="yellow">Something upbeat.</font>

494
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,890
<font color="yellow">Come on, Doctor!
How can I with all these kids here?</font>

495
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,250
<font color="yellow">How can I sing a song?</font>

496
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,220
<font color="yellow">That's very upbeat!</font>

497
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,810
<font color="yellow">This is great!</font>

498
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,590
<font color="yellow">You should go on up.</font>

499
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,320
<font color="yellow">- You're not going to watch?
- No.</font>

500
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,840
<font color="yellow">Where will you be?</font>

501
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,520
<font color="yellow">Where other patients'
family members wait.</font>

502
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,980
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's get started.</font>

503
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,180
<font color="yellow">Scalpel.</font>

504
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,650
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

505
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,710
<font color="yellow">To the left.</font>

506
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,880
<font color="yellow">Farther inside.</font>

507
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,130
<font color="yellow">I found it. Suction.</font>

508
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,700
<font color="yellow">Use the CUSA to get
the central part of the tumor.</font>

509
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,010
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

510
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,410
<font color="yellow">If you're going to take part like this,
why don't you do the surgery yourself?</font>

511
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,820
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung!</font>

512
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,070
<font color="yellow">I cannot operate under such conditions.</font>

513
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,970
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

514
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="yellow">Let's start over.</font>

515
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,670
<font color="yellow"><i>[HONG DOO SHIK]</i></font>

516
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,320
<font color="yellow">Is it working?</font>

517
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,980
<font color="yellow">It's not working.</font>

518
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,070
<font color="yellow">Is it working?</font>

519
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,640
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

520
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,480
<font color="yellow">Do you see this?</font>

521
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,580
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- We need to push that.</font>

522
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,820
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

523
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,980
<font color="yellow">Is the surgery going well?</font>

524
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,060
<font color="yellow">As long as you do the suction well,
it will succeed.</font>

525
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,970
<font color="yellow">Waiting was difficult, right?</font>

526
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,670
<font color="yellow">The time was moving so slowly.</font>

527
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,840
<font color="yellow">I know how that feels.</font>

528
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,920
<font color="yellow">I will now tell you
the results of the surgery.</font>

529
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,270
<font color="yellow">It's written all over your face.</font>

530
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,860
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong, the surgery was a success.</font>

531
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

532
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,440
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

533
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, well...</font>

534
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,880
<font color="yellow">Looks like we'll be having dinner.
You said I owed you if you succeeded.</font>

535
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,380
<font color="yellow">There's no need for that.</font>

536
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,150
<font color="yellow">No, I did make a promise.</font>

537
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,220
<font color="yellow">Buy me dinner too if you're buying.</font>

538
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,610
<font color="yellow">You stay out of it.</font>

539
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I thought I was going to die.
It was so hard waiting.</font>

540
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,490
<font color="yellow">Yes, what is it?</font>

541
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:14,190
<font color="yellow">Patient Kim Jin Han is in
a lot of pain and vomiting.</font>

542
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,090
<font color="yellow">Should I increase the painkillers?</font>

543
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,900
<font color="yellow">There was nothing wrong in the CT, right?</font>

544
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,930
<font color="yellow"><i>No.</i></font>

545
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,350
<font color="yellow">Wait a little longer.</font>

546
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,970
<font color="yellow">If the pain still persists,
give her half an ampoule of morphine.</font>

547
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,180
<font color="yellow">Morphine? Okay.</font>

548
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,610
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

549
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,260
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

550
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:37,180
<font color="yellow">Oh! Hello.</font>

551
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,320
<font color="yellow">- Get me a cup ramen too.
- Okay.</font>

552
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,050
<font color="yellow">Did you put in the order for Kim Jin Han?</font>

553
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

554
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,440
<font color="yellow">Is there any kimchi?</font>

555
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,970
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

556
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,850
<font color="yellow">You don't have much common sense.</font>

557
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,860
<font color="yellow">Kimchi is a necessity in cup ramen.</font>

558
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,840
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry.</font>

559
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,300
<font color="yellow">- Were you going to eat it all?
- No.</font>

560
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,940
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm on a kimchi diet.</font>

561
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,710
<font color="yellow">There was some research done
on white mice</font>

562
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,670
<font color="yellow">that showed kimchi is good for diets.</font>

563
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,760
<font color="yellow">Why would you eat ramen though?</font>

564
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,940
<font color="yellow">You're a second year,
but you gain weight.</font>

565
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,810
<font color="yellow">Life must be pretty easy.
Should I help you lose weight?</font>

566
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,490
<font color="yellow">Eat, eat, eat.</font>

567
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,310
<font color="yellow">It's so good!</font>

568
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,450
<font color="yellow">You have to eat ramen with kimchi.</font>

569
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,850
<font color="yellow">Doctor, if you have
something to say, just say it.</font>

570
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,040
<font color="yellow">Stop playing around.</font>

571
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,230
<font color="yellow">- I came to do business.
- What?</font>

572
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:45,390
<font color="yellow">Sooni Hawaii is a cafe my friend owns.
I want you guys to go often.</font>

573
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,980
<font color="yellow">This is kind of weird, right?
I know it is.</font>

574
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,800
<font color="yellow">She's a really close friend,
so let me off the hook.</font>

575
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,000
<font color="yellow">You can eat this.</font>

576
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,750
<font color="yellow">What was that? That was cute.</font>

577
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,040
<font color="yellow">She's unexpectedly charming.</font>

578
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,690
<font color="yellow">I'm going to start living at
Sooni Hawaii from now on.</font>

579
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,500
<font color="yellow">Okay, just live there and you can
have your bones buried there.</font>

580
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,510
<font color="yellow">Deal.</font>

581
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,760
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved that Director Hong regained
consciousness and his vitals are stable.</font>

582
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,050
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

583
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,960
<font color="yellow">Gosh, let's try to be friends.</font>

584
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,870
<font color="yellow">You always give me a short reply.</font>

585
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,800
<font color="yellow">Either that or you dump me.</font>

586
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,730
<font color="yellow">I didn't dump you.</font>

587
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,720
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you're saying I'm not the guy.</font>

588
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,780
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to heal that wound
by talking about it like this.</font>

589
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,120
<font color="yellow"><i>The doors are now closing.</i></font>

590
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,460
<font color="yellow">Senior, are you all right?</font>

591
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,420
<font color="yellow">I don't what you're
referring to, but I'm fine.</font>

592
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,250
<font color="yellow">You stabbed a person in the heart,
but you're doing fine.</font>

593
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,730
<font color="yellow">You're perfectly okay?</font>

594
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,590
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung, the guy that likes you
is a lowly person like this.</font>

595
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,120
<font color="yellow">He said he'd take anything from me
except for slapping his face.</font>

596
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,010
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

597
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,310
<font color="yellow">I'll get going first.</font>

598
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,030
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

599
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,090
<font color="yellow">Why would you follow me?</font>

600
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:47,700
<font color="yellow">I have to live too.</font>

601
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,190
<font color="yellow">How can I be in the same space as her?</font>

602
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,150
<font color="yellow">I really hate being like this
with Seo Woo.</font>

603
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,760
<font color="yellow">Do you think I enjoy it?</font>

604
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,660
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

605
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,210
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo is pretty.
Why did you reject her?</font>

606
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,180
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you reject me, Doctor Yoo?</font>

607
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,060
<font color="yellow">I know Seo Woo creates a problem for you,
but don't only think about your survival.</font>

608
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,570
<font color="yellow">I'm done living for other people.</font>

609
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:22,740
<font color="yellow">I can seduce men if I want to and
I can become a femme fatale.</font>

610
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,280
<font color="yellow">- You can never become that way.
- Why?</font>

611
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,910
<font color="yellow">People who really intend on
living that way don't announce it.</font>

612
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,280
<font color="yellow">They just do it.</font>

613
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,870
<font color="yellow">You don't know me that well yet.</font>

614
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,600
<font color="yellow">I've already done it.</font>

615
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,550
<font color="yellow">He was just talking and now he's asleep.</font>

616
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,010
<font color="yellow">He's like a baby.</font>

617
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,340
<font color="yellow">Please keep a
close eye on him, Nurse Yoo.</font>

618
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

619
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,760
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Nurse Yoo.</font>

620
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,030
<font color="yellow">Were you really going to exclude me
and take Doctor Jung out for dinner?</font>

621
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,580
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's with you?</font>

622
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,220
<font color="yellow">I'm just happy to get this over with.</font>

623
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,510
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Kim Tae Ho.</font>

624
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,590
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor Yoo Hye Jung is
a fellow in our department.</font>

625
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,980
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

626
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,030
<font color="yellow">That can't be true.</font>

627
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,030
<font color="yellow">I will check with her.</font>

628
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,270
<font color="yellow">That day and time work for me.</font>

629
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:44,860
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

630
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,570
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo Hye Jung is being called
before a disciplinary committee.</font>

631
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it's about.</font>

632
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:00,450
<font color="yellow">She returned the car.</font>

633
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,490
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a bit overboard to call a
disciplinary committee over this?</font>

634
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,000
<font color="yellow">I didn't want things to
go this far either.</font>

635
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,640
<font color="yellow">The person who called in the tip
was too powerful.</font>

636
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,790
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

637
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,320
<font color="yellow">Is that person more powerful than me?</font>

638
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,470
<font color="yellow">It was Doctor Jin Seo Woo.</font>

639
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,620
<font color="yellow">The hospital director's daughter.</font>

640
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,710
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

641
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,330
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

642
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,090
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

643
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,480
<font color="yellow">It's been a very long time since
just the two us met like this.</font>

644
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,120
<font color="yellow">How have you been
adjusting to the hospital?</font>

645
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,270
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's been okay.</font>

646
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,160
<font color="yellow">I got a call from the
internal audit team.</font>

647
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,140
<font color="yellow">They wanted to set a date for you to
go before the disciplinary committee.</font>

648
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,040
<font color="yellow">I am one of the committee members.</font>

649
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,100
<font color="yellow">They say Gong Byung Doo gave you
a foreign car as a gift.</font>

650
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,260
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

651
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,720
<font color="yellow">It is true.</font>

652
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,640
<font color="yellow">I wanted to give it back to him,
but I couldn't find a way to return it.</font>

653
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:10,600
<font color="yellow">Of course, I don't believe that you
accepted that car with strings attached.</font>

654
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:15,020
<font color="yellow">However, the committee members
won't all agree with me.</font>

655
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:18,990
<font color="yellow">There is a thing called
a "strange coincidence."</font>

656
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:22,150
<font color="yellow">It's best not get into
situations that arouse suspicion.</font>

657
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,100
<font color="yellow">It was a stone that came
rolling your way.</font>

658
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:26,360
<font color="yellow">I was careless.</font>

659
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,030
<font color="yellow">You may have to take a pay cut.</font>

660
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,560
<font color="yellow">Or a suspension, at least.</font>

661
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,280
<font color="yellow">Worst case scenario,
you may have to leave the hospital.</font>

662
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,010
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go for coffee?</font>

663
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,380
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were in a good mood
after your father's surgery.</font>

664
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,690
<font color="yellow">I ruined it, right?</font>

665
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,420
<font color="yellow">I wasn't thinking that at all.</font>

666
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,660
<font color="yellow">You should go home and rest.</font>

667
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:18,450
<font color="yellow">Today was a tiring day.</font>

668
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:20,960
<font color="yellow">I'm not tired. You must be exhausted.</font>

669
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,910
<font color="yellow">I bet you want to go home and rest.</font>

670
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,230
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

671
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,890
<font color="yellow">Then, go rest.</font>

672
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,100
<font color="yellow">I looked into the disciplinary committee
and I can go too, as a board member.</font>

673
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,790
<font color="yellow">So don't worry too much.</font>

674
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,410
<font color="yellow">I'm not worried.</font>

675
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,760
<font color="yellow">It's not my goal to
remain in this hospital.</font>

676
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,810
<font color="yellow">Yeah, you shouldn't
take it too seriously.</font>

677
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,900
<font color="yellow">Doctor, are you okay
with everything I do?</font>

678
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,590
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm okay.</font>

679
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,340
<font color="yellow">That's a fantasy.</font>

680
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,110
<font color="yellow">Even with parents and children,
everything cannot be okay.</font>

681
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:51,020
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so cold to me suddenly?</font>

682
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,720
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

683
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,150
<font color="yellow">Doctor! Doctor Choi, Doctor Choi!</font>

684
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,850
<font color="yellow">What, what, what?</font>

685
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,530
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo is going to
get disciplined because of us.</font>

686
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:24,170
<font color="yellow">That's what the internal audit was about?</font>

687
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,040
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Darn it.</font>

688
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,800
<font color="yellow">Good. You should be punished
if you did something wrong.</font>

689
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,460
<font color="yellow">That's how the world works.</font>

690
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,920
<font color="yellow">You'll be hit by a boomerang, Chief.</font>

691
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:39,230
<font color="yellow">Is this place some sort of
water cooler?</font>

692
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,730
<font color="yellow">Is the station a place for
you guys to gossip?</font>

693
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,410
<font color="yellow">I thought he was too quiet lately.</font>

694
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,130
<font color="yellow">Hey, you. What are you whispering about?</font>

695
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,270
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

696
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,160
<font color="yellow">How is Kim Yi Chul's mental state?</font>

697
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,320
<font color="yellow">It's drowsy.</font>

698
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,870
<font color="yellow">Why isn't it on the chart, then?</font>

699
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,330
<font color="yellow">You're all too busy playing around here!</font>

700
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,990
<font color="yellow">Kang Kyung Joon, follow me.</font>

701
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,030
<font color="yellow">Doctor, it's not that we want to gossip.</font>

702
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:10,980
<font color="yellow">Something big happened,
so we had to discuss it.</font>

703
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,000
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

704
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,370
<font color="yellow">If it turns out to be nothing,
you'll be punished for one week.</font>

705
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:19,390
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo Hye Jung is being called
before the disciplinary committee...</font>

706
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:25,120
<font color="yellow">Tell me all the details.
Why are you stopping in the middle?</font>

707
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:27,780
<font color="yellow">Okay, so... so...</font>

708
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:29,550
<font color="yellow">Stop stuttering!</font>

709
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,280
<font color="yellow">Boss came to the hospital
because he was hurt, right?</font>

710
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,710
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo Hye Jung
performed surgery on him.</font>

711
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,870
<font color="yellow">The surgery went well and
he wanted to thank her...</font>

712
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,970
<font color="yellow">- Do you know?
- I know.</font>

713
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,230
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what I'm
talking about before answering?</font>

714
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,260
<font color="yellow">You're talking about
the disciplinary committee.</font>

715
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,780
<font color="yellow">Well, it's nice that you
understand very quickly.</font>

716
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:02,320
<font color="yellow">I got rejected by Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

717
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,660
<font color="yellow">- You knew that would happen?
- Yes.</font>

718
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,190
<font color="yellow">Do you know how long I've known her?</font>

719
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,180
<font color="yellow">We're still only in the flirtation stage.</font>

720
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,470
<font color="yellow">I see. She's at a very high level.</font>

721
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,180
<font color="yellow">You are amazing to even be
at a flirtation stage.</font>

722
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,020
<font color="yellow">Right? I think I'm amazing too.</font>

723
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,140
<font color="yellow">I'm still going to like her though.</font>

724
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:26,230
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do anything
because it seems low.</font>

725
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:29,320
<font color="yellow">If I see any room between you two,
I'm going to make my move.</font>

726
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,660
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

727
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,490
<font color="yellow">I got rejected.
Aren't you going to console me?</font>

728
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,800
<font color="yellow">Buy me dinner.
You said you'd buy me dinner.</font>

729
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,220
<font color="yellow">I can't today. I'm meeting someone.</font>

730
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,890
<font color="yellow">He always leaves first.</font>

731
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:51,400
<font color="yellow">Hello, there.</font>

732
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,850
<font color="yellow">I'm Hong Ji Hong.
Sorry to make you come all this way.</font>

733
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,840
<font color="yellow">Oh no! No need to be sorry.</font>

734
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,490
<font color="yellow">I'm Section Chief of General Surgery,
Kim Chi Hyun.</font>

735
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:02,850
<font color="yellow">- Let's sit down.
- Okay.</font>

736
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,530
<font color="yellow">It's an honor to meet you.</font>

737
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:10,200
<font color="yellow">To meet the son of the board director
and a renowned neurosurgeon like you.</font>

738
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,450
<font color="yellow">What would you like to eat?</font>

739
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,440
<font color="yellow">You're uploading more?</font>

740
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,490
<font color="yellow">I'm getting a very good response.</font>

741
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,700
<font color="yellow">If this gets turned into a movie,
I could rake in a lot of money.</font>

742
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,060
<font color="yellow">What will you do with that money?</font>

743
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,790
<font color="yellow">I should give some to
Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

744
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,550
<font color="yellow">I feel bad about
the disciplinary committee.</font>

745
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,630
<font color="yellow">You just feel bad?</font>

746
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,860
<font color="yellow">I don't have any money right now.</font>

747
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,370
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't know it at the time.</i></font>

748
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,240
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't realize the threat that was
coming for the female doctor.</i></font>

749
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,390
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll be taking a break
before the next installment.</i></font>

750
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Gangster Female Doctor is so good.</i></font>

751
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:54,340
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are you going on a break?</i></font>

752
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,570
<font color="yellow">Wow! People really anticipate it.</font>

753
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,110
<font color="yellow">I told you so.</font>

754
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,270
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's just go.</font>

755
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,880
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo was promoting a business.</font>

756
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,640
<font color="yellow">Is Doctor Yoo running a business?</font>

757
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,760
<font color="yellow">Can we order something?</font>

758
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,270
<font color="yellow">Hello!</font>

759
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,830
<font color="yellow">Hello, cute doctor.</font>

760
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,010
<font color="yellow">- I'm here too.
- Yes, I know.</font>

761
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,210
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

762
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,950
<font color="yellow">is our Doctor Pi Young Gook not here?</font>

763
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,260
<font color="yellow">No, can you give us some ramen?</font>

764
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,280
<font color="yellow">You must like ramen a lot.</font>

765
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,720
<font color="yellow">You could make some in the hospital.</font>

766
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,300
<font color="yellow">You should save your money
since you're a resident.</font>

767
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,770
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Is there anything like rice?</font>

768
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:40,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, come on.</font>

769
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:42,980
<font color="yellow">- Sit here.
- Okay.</font>

770
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,740
<font color="yellow">- I'll bring you a menu.
- Okay.</font>

771
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

772
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,350
<font color="yellow">- Can I help you with anything?
- Oh! You scared me!</font>

773
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:55,960
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can help me.</font>

774
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,390
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

775
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,560
<font color="yellow">Please move your face aside.</font>

776
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:06,360
<font color="yellow">Don't try to comfort me.
Don't comfort me.</font>

777
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,220
<font color="yellow">I'm extremely curious what it is
that you wanted to talk to me about.</font>

778
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:17,210
<font color="yellow">You were part of the team that
operated on this patient, right?</font>

779
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:24,830
<font color="yellow">I wanted to hear the details
of what happened that day.</font>

780
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:30,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, I can't remember it very well.
It's been so long.</font>

781
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:32,830
<font color="yellow">It's rare for a table death to occur
for stomach cancer.</font>

782
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:34,410
<font color="yellow">I think you would remember that.</font>

783
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:40,240
<font color="yellow">There was a young woman who came by
who was the patient's guardian.</font>

784
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,000
<font color="yellow">Do you have a connection to her?</font>

785
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,950
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're talking about.</font>

786
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,000
<font color="yellow">I was very close to the person
that passed away.</font>

787
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,880
<font color="yellow">Ah, I see.</font>

788
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm suddenly feeling so fatigued.</font>

789
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:14,460
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

790
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,080
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why are you showing up
so early and ruining my day?</font>

791
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,820
<font color="yellow">If you don't want me showing up,
you could just tell me.</font>

792
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:26,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

793
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,880
<font color="yellow">- Do you want something to drink?
- No, thank you.</font>

794
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,800
<font color="yellow">I'm here because you didn't call.</font>

795
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,070
<font color="yellow">There was excessive bleeding
during the surgery, right?</font>

796
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:38,390
<font color="yellow">Why do you think that?</font>

797
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:46,510
<font color="yellow">I saw people running in panic,
holding blood packs.</font>

798
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,820
<font color="yellow">There is more than one operating room.</font>

799
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:52,130
<font color="yellow">Did you touch her liver
or was a blood vessel cut?</font>

800
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,170
<font color="yellow">I really can't converse with you.</font>

801
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:56,650
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I'm even talking to you?</font>

802
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,670
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship to
Professor Hong Ji Hong?</font>

803
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,720
<font color="yellow">He has nothing to do with this.</font>

804
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,240
<font color="yellow">So, you do know him.</font>

805
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,420
<font color="yellow">Professor Hong said he didn't know you.</font>

806
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:13,350
<font color="yellow">You acted like you had a great cause
and you wanted to find out the truth.</font>

807
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,560
<font color="yellow">Then you used Professor Hong
to threaten me.</font>

808
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,360
<font color="yellow">This is extremely upsetting to me.</font>

809
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,550
<font color="yellow">Please leave.</font>

810
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,160
<font color="yellow">I'll be back again.</font>

811
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,970
<font color="yellow">I'll keep coming back.</font>

812
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,870
<font color="yellow"><i>Come in.</i></font>

813
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,750
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

814
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,960
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

815
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,570
<font color="yellow">I was very clear with you.</font>

816
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,740
<font color="yellow">I said this was my own assignment.
I told you to stay out of it.</font>

817
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,730
<font color="yellow"><i>That young woman came again,
Kang Mal Soon's guardian.</i></font>

818
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,630
<font color="yellow">I told you to be more aggressive.</font>

819
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,320
<font color="yellow">Professor Hong Ji Hong wanted to
meet me last night.</font>

820
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:28,220
<font color="yellow">If Professor Hong is involved in this,
I can't ignore it and let it go.</font>

821
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,310
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

822
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,410
<font color="yellow">What would happen to me if I got on
Director Hong's bad side?</font>

823
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,090
<font color="yellow">Director Hong is going to retire.
You just need to listen to me.</font>

824
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,980
<font color="yellow">That woman said she's going to come back.</font>

825
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,710
<font color="yellow">A person who wanted to resolve it
through law would be easier.</font>

826
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,740
<font color="yellow">Why is Hong Ji Hong involved?</font>

827
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,480
<font color="yellow">Are you this angry because I met up
with Section Chief Kim Chi Hyun?</font>

828
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,690
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

829
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,970
<font color="yellow">It's easier and faster
if we do it together</font>

830
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,200
<font color="yellow">rather than you, alone.</font>

831
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,830
<font color="yellow">You do everything with Soon Hee.
It's no different than that.</font>

832
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:16,160
<font color="yellow">Then, why don't you tell me anything?</font>

833
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,180
<font color="yellow">You sent me off earlier
when we were fishing.</font>

834
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,950
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask you about it.</font>

835
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:25,060
<font color="yellow">It was because the hospital got audited
by the tax administration.</font>

836
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,690
<font color="yellow">You didn't even tell me
your father was ill.</font>

837
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,060
<font color="yellow">I heard it from someone else.</font>

838
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,370
<font color="yellow">Who am I to you?</font>

839
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,040
<font color="yellow">That's because I thought you would worry.</font>

840
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,600
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

841
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,810
<font color="yellow">Why should you have to go through
hardships because of me?</font>

842
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,230
<font color="yellow">It's not hard.</font>

843
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,350
<font color="yellow">It's not hard for me either.</font>

844
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:45,170
<font color="yellow">Why won't you share your worries with me?</font>

845
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,990
<font color="yellow">It's because I've never shared
my worries with anyone before.</font>

846
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,050
<font color="yellow">I've always made decisions on my own.
It's become a habit.</font>

847
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,760
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with you.</font>

848
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,260
<font color="yellow">It does...</font>

849
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,180
<font color="yellow">if you and I are to start a relationship
as man and woman.</font>

850
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:11,870
<font color="yellow">You say we should do everything together.</font>

851
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,780
<font color="yellow">So why do you want to
stick to your old habits?</font>

852
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,850
<font color="yellow">Is that love?</font>

853
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,570
<font color="yellow">That's just being a burden.</font>

854
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,640
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to be in a burdensome love.</font>

855
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:37,390
<font color="yellow"><i>In the past, he gave me
the desire to become a good person.</i></font>

856
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:44,590
<font color="yellow"><i>Being a good person is different than
being a good man or woman.</i></font>
