<font color="yellow">Her CT scan shows a fraction in her calvaria...</font>

<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

155
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,980
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let her go to work.</font>

156
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,350
<font color="yellow">Did she fall down the stairs at work?</font>

157
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,350
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- We took a CT.</font>

158
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,090
<font color="yellow">I'll explain the results soon. Bear with us for a while.</font>

159
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ms Cho. Ms Cho.</font>

161
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,720
<font color="yellow">Shall I call Prof. Hong?</font>

162
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, and book an operating room.</font>

163
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

164
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,620
<font color="yellow">We need to do an emergency operation.</font>

165
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,090
<font color="yellow">The bleeding's bad. Don't you have to as well?</font>

166
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,420
<font color="yellow">Call your doctor. We need to decide who will go first.</font>

176
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
<font color="yellow">What about her history?</font>

177
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
<font color="yellow">Nothing worth noting.</font>

178
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
<font color="yellow">Book an OR and call Anaesthesiology.</font>

179
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,080
<font color="yellow">I already did.</font>

180

- General Surgery's joining us.</font>

184
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,720
<font color="yellow">Very well. I get it.</font>

185
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,750
<font color="yellow">Can't you even brief me?</font>

186
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,320
<font color="yellow">You're terrible.</font>

187
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,780
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me she'd hurt her head too?</font>

188
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

191
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,880
<font color="yellow">Today. Let's have a drink with Pa Ran.</font>

192
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,450
<font color="yellow">We meet again.</font>

193
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,350
<font color="yellow">You two should talk. I'll prepare for surgery.</font>

194
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
<font color="yellow">She doesn't look so happy.</font>

195
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,550
<font color="yellow">Are you dating?</font>

196
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,220
<font color="yellow">No, don't answer that.</font>

197
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,820
<font color="yellow">I don't want to know yet.</font>

198
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,120
<font color="yellow">You still ask questions and answer them yourself.</font>

199
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,250
<font color="yellow">As if I'd change.</font>

200
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,780
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

201
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,650

203
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,450
<font color="yellow">The superior sagittal sinus.</font>

204
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,720

205
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,950
<font color="yellow">Two hours? Okay.</font>

206
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,150
<font color="yellow">Set things up after they're done and call me.</font>

207

<font color="yellow">Are you trying to be The Giving Tree?</font>

240
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,320

- Or Daddy Long Legs?</font>

241
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,350

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,420
<font color="yellow">Why would we get fired?</font>

269
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,180
<font color="yellow">My position's temporary anyway.</font>

270
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,720

<font color="yellow">It's one of our rules. We cannot accept gifts from patients.</font>

429

<font color="yellow">I told you to be friendly with everyone.</font>

434
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,880
<font color="yellow">Will people like you if they find out that you reported it?</font>

435
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,450
<font color="yellow">I like the fellow who received that gift.</font>

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,450

<font color="yellow">Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

439
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,520
<font color="yellow">You should be hanging out with people like that.</font>

440
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,480
<font color="yellow">You should learn from her. Learn!</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

442
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,220
<font color="yellow">She bled a lot,</font>

443
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,350
<font color="yellow">so get a CT scan again within 12 hours.</font>

444

447
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,820
<font color="yellow">By the way, why isn't she waking up?</font>

448
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,880
<font color="yellow">She might still be under the influence of anaesthesia.</font>

449
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,120
<font color="yellow">It still hasn't been too long, so let's wait a little more.</font>

450
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

451
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

- Yes. I am her husband.</font>

454
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,920
<font color="yellow">Her liver wasn't badly damaged,</font>

455
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,280
<font color="yellow">but due to her ruptured hepatic artery, and she lost a lot of blood.</font>

456
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,720
<font color="yellow">But we stopped the bleeding well, so don't worry too much.</font>
