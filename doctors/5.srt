00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:16,622
<font color="yellow">I heard you still beat up people.</font>

3
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:18,622
<font color="yellow">I heard everything from Kang Soo.</font>

4
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:26,462
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask me to meet up? I see you at the hospital.</font>

5
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:29,092
<font color="yellow">There's something that's been bothering me.</font>

6
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,492
<font color="yellow">I had to get it over with.</font>

7
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:33,592
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

8
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:34,762
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep making me a married man?</font>

9
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,792
<font color="yellow">I didn't make you a married man. It was your choice.</font>

10
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,492
<font color="yellow">You've changed.</font>

11
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:43,222
<font color="yellow">Why do you listen to other people?</font>

12
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:44,562
<font color="yellow">I am not married.</font>

13
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,062
<font color="yellow">Okay. You aren't married.</font>

14
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:48,722
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

15
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:49,992
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

16
00:00:54,992 --> 00:00:56,622
<font color="yellow">I had made up my mind after I got beaten up by you.</font>

17
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,022
<font color="yellow">I made my mind that I won't get beaten up by you again.</font>

18
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:02,192
<font color="yellow">You body moves on reflex when you're in danger...</font>

19
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:05,832
<font color="yellow">in a way you learned and practised or you are used to.</font>

20
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:09,792
<font color="yellow">We learn the habits we need your body to know when we are young.</font>

21
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:13,362
<font color="yellow">Once your childhood passes,</font>

22
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,122
<font color="yellow">nothing can take its place.</font>

23
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:37,962
<font color="yellow">I give up!</font>

24
00:01:59,622 --> 00:02:00,992
<font color="yellow">Is this a mount?</font>

25
00:02:01,862 --> 00:02:02,892
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

26
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:05,022
<font color="yellow">Can you get off of me?</font>

27
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,892
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

28
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:08,962
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

29
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,462
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

30
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:11,762
<font color="yellow">Oh gosh.</font>

31
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,492
<font color="yellow">I was too focused on winning.</font>

32
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,592
<font color="yellow">Did I hurt you?</font>

33
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:23,962
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm fine. - That's a relief.</font>

34
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:28,862
<font color="yellow">It would've been nice...</font>

35
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:30,962
<font color="yellow">if you hadn't fought back.</font>

36
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,362
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to fight against you again.</font>

37
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:35,622
<font color="yellow">Me, neither.</font>

38
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:39,262
<font color="yellow">- Why won't you fight me? - No reason.</font>

39
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:50,622
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

40
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:52,622
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

41
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:55,492
<font color="yellow">You're too strong.</font>

42
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:02,822
<font color="yellow">Do you hear me?</font>

43
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:12,062
<font color="yellow">I got rid of the tube as soon as she regained consciousness.</font>

44
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,592
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

45
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:15,892
<font color="yellow">I feel responsible for her.</font>

46
00:03:18,122 --> 00:03:20,292
<font color="yellow">- What is your name? - That witch...</font>

47
00:03:21,762 --> 00:03:24,022
<font color="yellow">Do you understand me? What's your name?</font>

48
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,622
<font color="yellow">That witch...</font>

49
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:28,292
<font color="yellow">Please state your name first.</font>

50
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:32,192
<font color="yellow">Woo... Myung... Mn.</font>

51
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:34,722
<font color="yellow">It's okay. She just has mental drowsiness.</font>

52
00:03:34,862 --> 00:03:36,092
<font color="yellow">Please lift your right arm.</font>

53
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,662
<font color="yellow">Please lift your leg.</font>

54
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:48,892
<font color="yellow">She's following your instructions.</font>

55
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,062
<font color="yellow">You have to get plenty of rest.</font>

56
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,462
<font color="yellow">Give her 100cc of mannitol every six hours.</font>

57
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,662
<font color="yellow">She could get worse if her blood pressure drops.</font>

58
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,692
<font color="yellow">Aim her systolic pressure to be between 160 and 180.</font>

59
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:03,762
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Her artery won't burst again.</font>

60
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:04,992
<font color="yellow">So don't worry and keep the nimodipine.</font>

61
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,222
<font color="yellow">If she has a severe headache, give her acetaminophen.</font>

62
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:08,992
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't improve, give her half a bottle of ample morphine.</font>

63
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,692
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

64
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:22,492
<font color="yellow">- What? - I didn't know I'd do it like this.</font>

65
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,792
<font color="yellow">I lost my momentum, but I want to say it.</font>

66
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,222
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

67
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,462
<font color="yellow">I liked you when you liked someone else,</font>

68
00:04:30,662 --> 00:04:32,092
<font color="yellow">and even after you broke up.</font>

69
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:34,422
<font color="yellow">It wasn't love at first sight, though.</font>

70
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,392
<font color="yellow">- You silly thing. - What?</font>

71
00:04:37,392 --> 00:04:39,592
<font color="yellow">You know the type of women I like.</font>

72
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:40,662
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

73
00:04:40,892 --> 00:04:42,822
<font color="yellow">It's time you stop getting fooled.</font>

74
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:44,192
<font color="yellow">I don't think I was fooled.</font>

75
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:47,592
<font color="yellow">I grew up as much as I loved and was hurt by those women.</font>

76
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,322
<font color="yellow">You grew up? Nonsense.</font>

77
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,192
<font color="yellow">Who put up with all your drunken whining?</font>

78
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,532
<font color="yellow">- Why do you like women with a past? - I wonder myself.</font>

79
00:04:55,692 --> 00:04:57,222
<font color="yellow">Why do I like such women?</font>

80
00:04:57,222 --> 00:04:59,792
<font color="yellow">I'm cheerful, come from a nice family...</font>

81
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:00,962
<font color="yellow">did well in school,</font>

82
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:03,892
<font color="yellow">- and I'm pretty... - Gosh. That's enough.</font>

83
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:05,962
<font color="yellow">Find someone else.</font>

84
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:08,032
<font color="yellow">You have weird taste.</font>

85
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,662
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

86
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:12,122
<font color="yellow">Why do you care what woman I pick?</font>

87
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,392
<font color="yellow">Is it about Hye Jung?</font>

88
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:15,792
<font color="yellow">Why are you mentioning her?</font>

89
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,532
<font color="yellow">She bothers you.</font>

90
00:05:17,822 --> 00:05:19,792
<font color="yellow">You met in school. Were you rivals?</font>

91
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,722
<font color="yellow">- Why would I be her rival? - See?</font>

92
00:05:22,862 --> 00:05:25,392
<font color="yellow">She seems to be someone with a past, but...</font>

93
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,462
<font color="yellow">- Do you care about her? - Of course I do.</font>

94
00:05:27,462 --> 00:05:29,022
<font color="yellow">Is this love at first sight?</font>

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,992
<font color="yellow">- Do you know what she's like? - You hate her, don't you?</font>

96
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:33,522
<font color="yellow">I can't let you be my girlfriend,</font>

97
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,122
<font color="yellow">but I can send her away.</font>

98
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,692
<font color="yellow">- For my sake? - Why would it be that?</font>

99
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,562
<font color="yellow">It's for my sake. I don't like having her around.</font>

100
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,822
<font color="yellow">She lacks skill and shows off. And she's rude.</font>

101
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,692
<font color="yellow">And she talks back, too.</font>

102
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,392
<font color="yellow">You can't kick her out. Our head likes her.</font>

103
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,622
<font color="yellow">A cerebral aneurysm case is all I need.</font>

104
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:56,792
<font color="yellow">Have you seen...</font>

105
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:58,992
<font color="yellow">reality that goes beyond imagination?</font>

106
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,422
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

107
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,492
<font color="yellow">In you.</font>

108
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:07,762
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be fine,</font>

109
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:10,092
<font color="yellow">but I didn't imagine you'd be a doctor.</font>

110
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,522
<font color="yellow">The world's still a decent place.</font>

111
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:14,462
<font color="yellow">I climbed society's ladder by studying.</font>

112
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:21,762
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

113
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:24,722
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

114
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:35,022
<font color="yellow">Shall I teach you how to insert a catheter without navigation?</font>

115
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:36,722
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

116
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:39,922
<font color="yellow">Then work for me starting next week.</font>

117
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,822
<font color="yellow">I'll come in tomorrow, but it's not an official work day.</font>

118
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,222
<font color="yellow">I just have to make rounds to see my patients.</font>

119
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:45,822
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

120
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,222
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

121
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:49,462
<font color="yellow">You can leave. I can manage now.</font>

122
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,692
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you must learn before you insert a catheter?</font>

123
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,162
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

124
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,762
<font color="yellow">Learn to accept protection.</font>

125
00:07:03,262 --> 00:07:04,562
<font color="yellow">It seems like nothing,</font>

126
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:06,662
<font color="yellow">because you can do everything.</font>

127
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:13,792
<font color="yellow">I can protect myself.</font>

128
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:16,262
<font color="yellow">People who grew up in a protective environment...</font>

129
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,862
<font color="yellow">trust themselves and society, and that's the basis of life.</font>

130
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,262
<font color="yellow">It can protect you...</font>

131
00:07:21,322 --> 00:07:22,592
<font color="yellow">when your life's in turmoil.</font>

132
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,992
<font color="yellow">Only children needs protection.</font>

133
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,922
<font color="yellow">You can't change or compensate for the past.</font>

134
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:29,322
<font color="yellow">You just accept it.</font>

135
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:34,022
<font color="yellow">You still don't listen.</font>

136
00:07:36,062 --> 00:07:39,192
<font color="yellow">I paid a huge price to learn that lesson.</font>

137
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:41,562
<font color="yellow">Incidents can't be changed,</font>

138
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,562
<font color="yellow">but your heart can.</font>

139
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,662
<font color="yellow">I don't know where to start and how much to teach you.</font>

140
00:07:48,662 --> 00:07:51,022
<font color="yellow">I need to write up a whole curriculum.</font>

141
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:53,962
<font color="yellow">- What for? - For no reason.</font>

142
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,062
<font color="yellow">Go on inside. I'll watch you go upstairs.</font>

143
00:07:58,492 --> 00:07:59,692
<font color="yellow">Don't turn around.</font>

144
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:15,562
<font color="yellow">You never listen.</font>

145
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:22,562
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong.</font>

146
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:23,722
<font color="yellow">Soon Hee.</font>

147
00:08:25,662 --> 00:08:26,992
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your marriage.</font>

148
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:30,162
<font color="yellow">No. No.</font>

149
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,162
<font color="yellow">No?</font>

150
00:08:31,322 --> 00:08:32,892
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

151
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,992
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Are you divorced, then?</font>

152
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:37,262
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

153
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,022
<font color="yellow">You've changed.</font>

154
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:41,922
<font color="yellow">She gossips.</font>

155
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,092
<font color="yellow">You don't know her, then.</font>

156
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:48,422

<font color="yellow">You once told me...</font>

459
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,822
<font color="yellow">that life would be easy if people could be categorised as good or bad.</font>

460
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,692
<font color="yellow">You said no values can beat our desire for sustenance.</font>

461
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,392
<font color="yellow">We're all humans after all.</font>

462
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:50,892
<font color="yellow">Some people must do what they want even though it could kill them.</font>

463
00:23:50,992 --> 00:23:53,592
<font color="yellow">Both you and I belong to that category. Aren't I right?</font>

464
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:55,622
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing me now or what?</font>

465
00:23:57,092 --> 00:23:58,162
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

466
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,792
<font color="yellow">(Neurosurgery, Jin Seo Woo)</font>

467
00:24:02,062 --> 00:24:03,122
<font color="yellow">Yes, Seo Woo.</font>

468
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:08,992
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

469
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:10,962
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

470
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:16,062
<font color="yellow">Do you think a fellow can do this surgery?</font>

471
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,392
<font color="yellow">This condition is quite critical.</font>

472
00:24:18,822 --> 00:24:20,262
<font color="yellow">A regular cerebral aneurysm surgery is complicated enough.</font>

473
00:24:20,262 --> 00:24:21,692
<font color="yellow">But this case has a ruptured daughter sac.</font>

474
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:24,422
<font color="yellow">This surgery can't be carried out by a fellow. Are you doing it?</font>

475
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,022
<font color="yellow">No, Hye Jung is doing it.</font>

476
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:29,062
<font color="yellow">Who decided that?</font>

477
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:31,562
<font color="yellow">Who decides who gets to perform a surgery like this?</font>

478
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:39,422
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to train Dr Yoo.</font>

479
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:41,622
<font color="yellow">You can't take her without my permission.</font>

480
00:24:41,622 --> 00:24:43,892
<font color="yellow">I'm aware that your work starts next week.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

481
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,462
<font color="yellow">Isn't that when it starts?</font>

482
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,462
<font color="yellow">Here's the update.</font>

483
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:48,722
<font color="yellow">My work starts today.</font>

484
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,022
<font color="yellow">So your fellowship arrangement is void.</font>

485
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:55,762
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo is not going to assist me. She will be performing the surgery.</font>

486
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,422
<font color="yellow">So it doesn't have anything to do with the fellowship.</font>

487
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,592
<font color="yellow">Then I am going in.</font>

488
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:02,162
<font color="yellow">A fellow cannot handle this surgery.</font>

489
00:25:02,192 --> 00:25:03,362
<font color="yellow">It's my patient.</font>

490
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,622
<font color="yellow">Didn't you just say it was Dr Yoo's surgery?</font>

491
00:25:06,362 --> 00:25:07,692
<font color="yellow">Then it must be Dr Yoo's patient.</font>

492
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:09,522
<font color="yellow">It is my patient.</font>

493
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,522
<font color="yellow">- I can't allow this. - Our training starts next week.</font>

494
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:16,092
<font color="yellow">I am still free. I will do what I want.</font>

495
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:17,762
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Don't be reckless.</font>

496
00:25:18,562 --> 00:25:19,562
<font color="yellow">I am confident about this.</font>

497
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,762
<font color="yellow">She's out of her bounds like this.</font>

498
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,422
<font color="yellow">Still, nothing changes. I'm going in.</font>

499
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:32,692
<font color="yellow">Suit yourself then.</font>

500
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:35,062
<font color="yellow">I will be the judge.</font>

501
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:41,292
<font color="yellow">- I will do it. - It's my fight.</font>

502
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:43,292
<font color="yellow">I don't avoid it when someone initiates it.</font>

503
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,662
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I only fight when I know I will win.</font>

504
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:50,862
<font color="yellow">Just don't forget that I got your back.</font>

505
00:25:53,822 --> 00:25:55,692
<font color="yellow">Also don't forget that I'm always ready to help you.</font>

506
00:26:11,562 --> 00:26:13,122
<font color="yellow">- I will assist. Move. - Yes.</font>

507
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:28,592
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

508
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:35,492
<font color="yellow">Give me a dissector.</font>

509
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:51,592
<font color="yellow">Bipolar forceps.</font>

510
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,222
<font color="yellow">Give me a cottonoid.</font>

511
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:06,462
<font color="yellow">She must've found it.</font>

512
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:10,522
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't be that easy to find.</font>

513
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:14,562
<font color="yellow">Clip.</font>

514
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:19,992
<font color="yellow">She found it.</font>

515
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:33,362
<font color="yellow">It ruptured.</font>

516
00:27:35,062 --> 00:27:36,062
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

517
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:40,962
<font color="yellow">Suction.</font>

518
00:27:53,562 --> 00:27:55,292
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it. - I can do it.</font>

519
00:27:58,462 --> 00:28:00,992
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo, let Prof. Hong take over.</font>

520
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:12,692
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung.</font>

521
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:20,622
<font color="yellow">The blood pressure is dropping. Bring more blood.</font>

522
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:35,492
<font color="yellow">Are you going to kill the patient, Dr Yoo?</font>

523
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:37,222
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong!</font>

524
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:40,722
<font color="yellow">Concentrate.</font>

525
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,192
<font color="yellow">Clip.</font>

526
00:29:11,622 --> 00:29:12,622
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

527
00:29:20,462 --> 00:29:21,462
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness!</font>

528
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:36,792
<font color="yellow">Do you want to take over?</font>

529
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,662
<font color="yellow">It's your surgery. Finish it.</font>

530
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:43,422
<font color="yellow">- Suction. - Suction.</font>

531
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:09,262
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo.</font>

532
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:20,362
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

533
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,762
<font color="yellow">If you apologise this easily,</font>

534
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,562
<font color="yellow">I will lose the fighting spirit.</font>

535
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:27,192
<font color="yellow">When I lose, I admit it fast.</font>

536
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,392
<font color="yellow">I will respect your decision now.</font>

537
00:30:30,822 --> 00:30:31,822
<font color="yellow">No matter what you do.</font>

538
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:35,422
<font color="yellow">I act like a gangster. I am rude.</font>

539
00:30:35,422 --> 00:30:36,692
<font color="yellow">And I know nothing.</font>

540
00:30:37,492 --> 00:30:40,162
<font color="yellow">I don't even try hard to learn. What could I do?</font>

541
00:30:40,722 --> 00:30:43,362
<font color="yellow">Well... I apologised just a second ago.</font>

542
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:45,392
<font color="yellow">You're still holding grudges.</font>

543
00:30:46,622 --> 00:30:47,792
<font color="yellow">You're very strange.</font>

544
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:50,562
<font color="yellow">- I am a little strange. - You admit things fast.</font>

545
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:52,022
<font color="yellow">I like that you're simple.</font>

546
00:30:52,862 --> 00:30:54,162
<font color="yellow">My granny used to be like that too.</font>

547
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:56,162
<font color="yellow">Even when she was scolding me,</font>

548
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:58,292
<font color="yellow">she suddenly became happy when I gave her what she wanted.</font>

549
00:30:58,422 --> 00:30:59,422
<font color="yellow">That's a compliment, isn't it?</font>

550
00:30:59,962 --> 00:31:01,822
<font color="yellow">I am rather simple.</font>

551
00:31:02,462 --> 00:31:04,092
<font color="yellow">You're still happy.</font>

552
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:11,562
<font color="yellow">I think Prof. Hong loves his student too much.</font>

553
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:14,222
<font color="yellow">I guess he liked you even more than Seo Woo when he was a teacher.</font>

554
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:16,462
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

555
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:19,892
<font color="yellow">He must be feeling like a parent who favour their weakest child.</font>

556
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,462
<font color="yellow">I got expelled from high school.</font>

557
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:26,622
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared? I was bad.</font>

558
00:31:28,462 --> 00:31:31,322
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what's so scary about that?</font>

559
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:34,192
<font color="yellow">I was pretty bad too when I was in school.</font>

560
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:36,522
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were when you were in arcades.</font>

561
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:38,092
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

562
00:31:44,962 --> 00:31:45,962
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

563
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:49,762
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

564
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,562
<font color="yellow">Hey, Uncle.</font>

565
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:55,862
<font color="yellow">It's good that I ran into you.</font>

566
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:58,862
<font color="yellow">Let me sleep at your place tonight.</font>

567
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:01,492
<font color="yellow">Why would you sleep at my place? You have a house with a model.</font>

568
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:03,192
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go home because of that model.</font>

569
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:05,462
<font color="yellow">- You were so in love with her. - She wants to get married.</font>

570
00:32:05,722 --> 00:32:06,962
<font color="yellow">I asked her to break up,</font>

571
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:09,222
<font color="yellow">and now she won't leave the house.</font>

572
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:10,792
<font color="yellow">Just settle down.</font>

573
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:13,162
<font color="yellow">You know my father. He's your grandfather.</font>

574
00:32:13,492 --> 00:32:16,092
<font color="yellow">He was married three times, and he had girlfriends when he wasn't.</font>

575
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:18,792
<font color="yellow">Even during the marriage, he secretly met girls.</font>

576
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:20,692
<font color="yellow">And your father, who is my elder brother,</font>

577
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,522
<font color="yellow">swore that he will never be like father,</font>

578
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,292
<font color="yellow">but he's preparing for his second divorce now.</font>

579
00:32:27,122 --> 00:32:29,962
<font color="yellow">Nobody settles down in my family.</font>

580
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:32,692
<font color="yellow">I am going to change the DNA.</font>

581
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:34,862
<font color="yellow">I thought like that too when I first got married.</font>

582
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,292
<font color="yellow">But no matter what you do, your genes never change.</font>

583
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:39,222
<font color="yellow">Will you let me stay or not?</font>

584
00:32:39,222 --> 00:32:40,922
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you the password.</font>

585
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:44,162
<font color="yellow">Why are you so inflexible?</font>

586
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:46,022
<font color="yellow">You can just change the password.</font>

587
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:49,222
<font color="yellow">That's right. That's true.</font>

588
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:51,962
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You seem dazed.</font>

589
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:56,162
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you like the girl who just passed by?</font>

590
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:59,222
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - I'm just kidding.</font>

591
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:03,492
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong will be joining your department next week, right?</font>

592
00:33:03,892 --> 00:33:05,362
<font color="yellow">Be nice to him. He's my best mate.</font>

593
00:33:07,562 --> 00:33:08,992
<font color="yellow">I already blew that.</font>

594
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:12,922
<font color="yellow">What? You already met him?</font>

595
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,992
<font color="yellow">I bought yours too. Do you want some coffee?</font>

596
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,962
<font color="yellow">I want to drink water.</font>

597
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:31,562
<font color="yellow">I'll give you water then.</font>

598
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:39,892
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

599
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,092
<font color="yellow">I want to drink coffee too.</font>

600
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,322
<font color="yellow">I'll give you that too.</font>

601
00:33:46,962 --> 00:33:47,992
<font color="yellow">Did you meet the guardian?</font>

602
00:33:48,062 --> 00:33:49,892
<font color="yellow">Yes. I comforted him.</font>

603
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,822
<font color="yellow">You're treating me nicely because I assisted your surgery, right?</font>

604
00:33:53,962 --> 00:33:55,692
<font color="yellow">This is nothing.</font>

605
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:58,322
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung.</font>

606
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:03,162
<font color="yellow">Will you continue to live like this?</font>

607
00:34:04,592 --> 00:34:06,292
<font color="yellow">How do I live right now?</font>

608
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:07,892
<font color="yellow">You are too competitive.</font>

609
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:11,422
<font color="yellow">You're successful now. So you should enjoy your life.</font>

610

<font color="yellow">How much sleep do you get everyday?</font>

611
00:34:13,922 --> 00:34:16,362
<font color="yellow">I get 10 hours of sleep a week. It became a habit.</font>

612
00:34:17,662 --> 00:34:19,392
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been where I am now...</font>

613
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,822
<font color="yellow">had I been living like everyone else.</font>

614
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:25,522
<font color="yellow">Are you happy now?</font>

615
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,162
<font color="yellow">There's no way I'd be happy.</font>

616
00:34:31,622 --> 00:34:32,692
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

617
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:38,892
<font color="yellow">When I first told you I wanted to live my life differently...</font>

618
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,992
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to give your grandma a better life.</font>

619
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:44,732
<font color="yellow">Yes, I lived a different life and became a success.</font>

620
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,022
<font color="yellow">But she's gone.</font>

621
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,292
<font color="yellow">That's not something I can help you with.</font>

622
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:55,192
<font color="yellow">Accept it.</font>

623
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,862
<font color="yellow">Why do you always want to help me?</font>

624
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:02,892
<font color="yellow">Do you still see me as your student?</font>

625
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:08,292
<font color="yellow">I may seem like the 18-year-old that always gets in trouble...</font>

626
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:09,592
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

627
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,122
<font color="yellow">that I'm acting like this because I'm your teacher?</font>

628
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:17,232
<font color="yellow">You're a fool if you think so.</font>

629
00:35:21,992 --> 00:35:23,162
<font color="yellow">Should I be happy...</font>

630
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:26,062
<font color="yellow">that you became a doctor without dating any guys...</font>

631
00:35:26,862 --> 00:35:28,392
<font color="yellow">and you don't know what attraction feels like?</font>

632
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,662
<font color="yellow">Don't you notice the way I look at you?</font>

633
00:35:37,062 --> 00:35:38,122
<font color="yellow">Whenever I think of you,</font>

634
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:42,422
<font color="yellow">I remember the last time I saw you.</font>

635
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:06,522
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let you go.</font>

636
00:36:11,732 --> 00:36:12,792
<font color="yellow">- Oh no! - Gosh, it's cold!</font>

637
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:16,762
<font color="yellow">- Is this your way of saying no? - No.</font>

638
00:36:18,732 --> 00:36:19,732
<font color="yellow">Then will you go out with me?</font>

639
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,322
<font color="yellow">- No. - Are you turning me down?</font>

640
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:26,662
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

641
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:28,732
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying no to both questions?</font>

642
00:36:29,732 --> 00:36:31,822
<font color="yellow">Do you habitually say no when you answer a question?</font>

643
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:33,662
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

644
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,762
<font color="yellow">I am right.</font>

645
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,092
<font color="yellow">I'll ask you again later.</font>

646
00:36:42,562 --> 00:36:43,962
<font color="yellow">It's because I feel awkward.</font>

647
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:46,062
<font color="yellow">It's weird...</font>

648
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,162
<font color="yellow">how we always start out talking about serious things,</font>

649
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:52,022
<font color="yellow">but end up in a comical situation. Whose fault is this?</font>

650
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:54,892
<font color="yellow">What's with the face?</font>

651
00:36:56,022 --> 00:36:58,262
<font color="yellow">You're odd. You've become odd.</font>

652
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:00,492
<font color="yellow">You mean girl.</font>

653
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:07,922
<font color="yellow">I'm going to ask you again later.</font>

654
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:12,162
<font color="yellow">I want you to answer yes no matter what I ask you.</font>

655
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:44,062
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming all this way despite your busy schedule.</font>

656
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,322
<font color="yellow">I am sorry I wasn't in touch.</font>

657
00:37:46,392 --> 00:37:49,092
<font color="yellow">Could I see my son since I'm here?</font>

658
00:37:49,292 --> 00:37:51,392
<font color="yellow">I heard Yoon Do is in surgery.</font>

659
00:37:52,122 --> 00:37:54,422
<font color="yellow">I get to barely see him ever since he moved out.</font>

660
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:56,392
<font color="yellow">I have to come searching for him.</font>

<font color="yellow">in medical care companies,</font>

668
00:38:19,162 --> 00:38:21,092

00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:23,962
<font color="yellow">It'll be a different story if I say that it was to make a profit.</font>

<font color="yellow">He thinks of his honour dearly.</font>

671
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:29,662
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that he'll back out on his own?</font>

672
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,022
<font color="yellow">I hope so, but we'll have to wait and see.</font>

673
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,962
<font color="yellow">What did the Ministry of Health and Welfare say?</font>

674

675

00:43:13,022 --> 00:43:14,462
<font color="yellow">I don't think it was a misunderstanding.</font>

762
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:18,622
<font color="yellow">Fine. If that's what you think, I respect that.</font>

763
00:43:19,322 --> 00:43:20,392
<font color="yellow">I'll change my words.</font>

764
00:43:21,362 --> 00:43:24,462
<font color="yellow">I have to make this clear...</font>

765
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:25,822
<font color="yellow">so we don't have any misunderstanding in the future.</font>

766
00:43:26,122 --> 00:43:29,292
<font color="yellow">Is it because I told you about Hye Jung's surgery?</font>

767
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:30,762
<font color="yellow">It includes that.</font>

768
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:33,662
<font color="yellow">I like Hye Jung.</font>

769
00:43:36,662 --> 00:43:38,962
<font color="yellow">You should tell Hye Jung that, not me.</font>

770
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:41,592
<font color="yellow">Do you think I told you without telling her first?</font>

771
00:43:44,692 --> 00:43:45,762
<font color="yellow">I'm happy for you.</font>

772
00:43:46,662 --> 00:43:49,092
<font color="yellow">I was nervous when she showed up in my life again.</font>

773
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:51,492
<font color="yellow">I was scared what she would take away from me this time.</font>

774
00:43:52,892 --> 00:43:54,392
<font color="yellow">At least it won't be love.</font>

775
00:43:56,062 --> 00:43:57,762
<font color="yellow">I like Dr Jung Yoon Do.</font>

776
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:01,592
<font color="yellow">We are alumni and our families are close, so I trust him.</font>

777
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:03,992
<font color="yellow">I hope you two can get along.</font>

778
00:44:05,262 --> 00:44:07,192
<font color="yellow">Could I ask you to be nice to her?</font>

779
00:44:07,362 --> 00:44:09,392
<font color="yellow">I was never mean to her first.</font>

780
00:44:10,392 --> 00:44:11,892
<font color="yellow">It was always her.</font>

781
00:44:13,522 --> 00:44:15,822
<font color="yellow">She was the one who approached me to ask about tutoring her.</font>

782
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:17,762
<font color="yellow">That's when my life started getting messed up.</font>

783
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:23,322
<font color="yellow">I miss In Joo.</font>

784
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:25,322
<font color="yellow">She's another victim.</font>

785
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:27,462
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have started this.</font>

786
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:29,792
<font color="yellow">This just can't get sorted out, can it?</font>

787
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:31,822
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong!</font>

788
00:44:32,422 --> 00:44:33,422
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

789
00:44:35,022 --> 00:44:36,022
<font color="yellow">Do you guys know each other?</font>

790
00:44:36,492 --> 00:44:37,492
<font color="yellow">Do you two know each other?</font>

791
00:44:37,522 --> 00:44:39,862
<font color="yellow">I asked you first, but I'll go ahead and answer your question.</font>

792
00:44:40,392 --> 00:44:41,922
<font color="yellow">Of course I know him. We're best friends.</font>

793
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:44,292
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong, In Joo and I hung out all the time in university.</font>

794
00:44:44,862 --> 00:44:45,862
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

795
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:47,222
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to ask me?</font>

796
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:48,992
<font color="yellow">It looks like I have to.</font>

797
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,622
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you fool.</font>

798
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:53,022
<font color="yellow">You should've come to me first as soon as you got here.</font>

799
00:44:53,022 --> 00:44:54,762
<font color="yellow">You always make me find you first.</font>

800
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:56,662
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now. You two should catch up.</font>

801
00:44:57,022 --> 00:44:59,622
<font color="yellow">Bye. We will just go for drinks now. Right, Ji Hong?</font>

802
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:02,662
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you even know what time it is now?</font>

803
00:45:02,722 --> 00:45:04,592
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Drinking in broad daylight is the best.</font>

804
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:05,592
<font color="yellow">Let's catch up later.</font>

805
00:45:05,892 --> 00:45:07,262
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait up!</font>

806
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:18,822
<font color="yellow">- Are you married yet? - No.</font>

807
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:21,762
<font color="yellow">- Do you have a boyfriend? - No.</font>

808
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,262
<font color="yellow">Then we're set.</font>

809
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:38,792
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you must learn before you insert a catheter?</font>

810
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:39,922
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

811
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:46,922
<font color="yellow">Learn to accept protection.</font>

812
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:00,492
<font color="yellow">I will be done soon.</font>

813
00:46:01,022 --> 00:46:02,862
<font color="yellow">So don't be pathetic and cry.</font>

814
00:46:02,922 --> 00:46:04,392
<font color="yellow">Go grab some food.</font>

815
00:46:28,192 --> 00:46:30,592
<font color="yellow">(Hong Hong Hong)</font>

816
00:46:37,392 --> 00:46:38,422
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

817
00:46:40,322 --> 00:46:42,022
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait for me outside.</font>

818
00:46:42,022 --> 00:46:43,462
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to a fellow briefly.</font>

819
00:46:43,662 --> 00:46:45,862
<font color="yellow">Can I just stay here? I mean, you're just talking to a fellow.</font>

820
00:46:46,422 --> 00:46:48,862
<font color="yellow">Gosh, just wait outside. Oh, there she is.</font>

821
00:46:49,662 --> 00:46:51,692
<font color="yellow">Oh, I saw her earlier.</font>

822
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:53,592
<font color="yellow">Introduce me to her. This is the second time.</font>

823
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:55,292
<font color="yellow">I told you to wait outside.</font>

824
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:57,662
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Yes, hello.</font>

825
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:01,022
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember me? I remember you.</font>

826
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:02,762
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

827
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,322
<font color="yellow">We'll meet again.</font>

828
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:08,622
<font color="yellow">We'll start going out the next time we cross paths.</font>

829
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:15,092
<font color="yellow">- Who is he? - A total lunatic.</font>

830
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:17,562
<font color="yellow">He's my friend, a staff member in General Surgery.</font>

831
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:19,122
<font color="yellow">What did you want to talk about?</font>

832
00:47:19,992 --> 00:47:21,562
<font color="yellow">Do you want the second question already?</font>

833
00:47:21,822 --> 00:47:24,162
<font color="yellow">No, don't do that. Not yet.</font>

834
00:47:25,492 --> 00:47:27,762
<font color="yellow">You just had such a serious face. I didn't mean to scare you.</font>

835
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:29,492
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

836
00:47:30,422 --> 00:47:31,522
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask you.</font>

837
00:47:31,792 --> 00:47:32,822
<font color="yellow">Sure. What is it?</font>

838
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:36,622
<font color="yellow">You're the chairman's son as well as the foundation's director.</font>

839
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:39,892
<font color="yellow">That means you have access to all the medical records here, right?</font>

840
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:41,562
<font color="yellow">You mean high-level information?</font>

841
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:44,522
<font color="yellow">Here, the level of access varies according to your employee level.</font>

842
00:47:44,722 --> 00:47:46,292
<font color="yellow">I'm not a permanent employee, so...</font>

843
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:50,192
<font color="yellow">Your access to medical records is restricted because of that reason?</font>

844
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:59,662
<font color="yellow">What are you asking? So do you want me to get...</font>

845
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:02,422
<font color="yellow">- information you can't access? - Prof. Hong. Let's talk later.</font>

846
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,462
<font color="yellow">- Why? What's wrong? - I saw a suspicious-looking guy.</font>

847
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:05,492
<font color="yellow">What? Wait...</font>

848
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:51,922
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

849
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,722
<font color="yellow">You walked in so quietly, Doctor.</font>

850
00:49:00,362 --> 00:49:02,492
<font color="yellow">Where did all of your people go?</font>

851
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:05,662
<font color="yellow">I sent them all home.</font>

852
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:07,392
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

853
00:49:07,662 --> 00:49:09,562
<font color="yellow">You told me to let them go.</font>

854
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,322
<font color="yellow">So you listened to me?</font>

855
00:49:11,692 --> 00:49:13,022
<font color="yellow">Do you actually want me to believe that?</font>

856
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,922
<font color="yellow">Well... I'd like to start...</font>

857
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:19,592
<font color="yellow">listening to women's advices.</font>

858
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,792
<font color="yellow">Why are you here by the way?</font>

859
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,762
<font color="yellow">Doctors don't need specific reasons to visit their patients.</font>

860
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:32,792
<font color="yellow">Please get some rest now.</font>

861
00:49:57,022 --> 00:49:58,492
<font color="yellow">- Yes, what's up? - The patient...</font>

862
00:49:58,492 --> 00:49:59,962
<font color="yellow">with cerebral aneurysm. His blood pressure is under 90.</font>

863
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:01,892
<font color="yellow">It's not going up even with an IV treatment and dopamine.</font>

864
00:50:02,462 --> 00:50:03,462
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

865
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:05,562
<font color="yellow">I'll come now.</font>

866
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:14,392
<font color="yellow">Door is closing.</font>

867
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:17,962
<font color="yellow">- Have you eaten yet? - No.</font>

868
00:50:18,022 --> 00:50:19,392
<font color="yellow">The emergency centre was swamped with patients,</font>

869
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,922
<font color="yellow">so I haven't even sat down all day.</font>

870
00:50:21,662 --> 00:50:22,792
<font color="yellow">Go and eat something.</font>

871
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:24,792
<font color="yellow">I have so much to do.</font>

872
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:27,362
<font color="yellow">I need to prepare for the Ms Kim Mal Joo's surgery.</font>

873
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:29,362
<font color="yellow">I have to dress that gangster boss' wound too.</font>

874
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:30,962
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the latter for you.</font>

875
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:32,262
<font color="yellow">That will give you time to eat, right?</font>

876
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:37,192
<font color="yellow">- You look thrilled. - Thank you.</font>

877
00:50:38,162 --> 00:50:39,762
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you so nice to me?</font>

878
00:50:40,122 --> 00:50:42,522
<font color="yellow">- Do you like me? - Don't be cheeky. Get out.</font>

879
00:50:43,862 --> 00:50:47,222
<font color="yellow">- What about you? - I'll go back up to the Boss.</font>

880
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:48,892
<font color="yellow">Thank you again.</font>

881
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:08,662
<font color="yellow">Shall I...</font>

882
00:51:09,422 --> 00:51:10,462
<font color="yellow">thrust this right here?</font>

883
00:51:13,892 --> 00:51:14,892
<font color="yellow">You rat.</font>

884
00:51:16,262 --> 00:51:17,262
<font color="yellow">Go and save my brother.</font>

885
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:22,662
<font color="yellow">Then I'll let you live too.</font>

886
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,262
<font color="yellow">Her vitals are stabilising.</font>

887
00:51:39,322 --> 00:51:40,792
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo is on night duty today, right?</font>

888
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:42,192
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Call her.</font>

889
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,392
<font color="yellow">Well, she's not answering.</font>

890
00:51:57,562 --> 00:51:59,192
<font color="yellow">Does that mean I have to leave her in your hand?</font>

891
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:03,492
<font color="yellow">Can I trust you?</font>

892
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:05,462
<font color="yellow">You can.</font>

893
00:52:06,062 --> 00:52:07,892
<font color="yellow">All right then. I'll trust you.</font>

894
00:52:29,562 --> 00:52:30,562
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

895
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,022
<font color="yellow">Here's your drink!</font>

896
00:52:44,022 --> 00:52:45,462
<font color="yellow">I hope you enjoy it.</font>

897
00:52:47,392 --> 00:52:49,792
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Where shall I put this?</font>

898
00:52:51,722 --> 00:52:52,722
<font color="yellow">Oh, well...</font>

899
00:52:53,692 --> 00:52:55,992
<font color="yellow">You can put it in the kitchen.</font>

900
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:04,762
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Oh my goodness.</font>

901
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:07,792
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's summer again. Hey, by the way,</font>

902
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:10,862
<font color="yellow">was her name Soo Jin? Are you still seeing her?</font>

903
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:14,192
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo Jin? Park Soo Jin? Which one?</font>

904
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,092
<font color="yellow">- Kim Soo Jin, you womaniser. - Whatever.</font>

905
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:18,492
<font color="yellow">Hang on. Yes, Soon Hee.</font>

906
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,992
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to your bar to grab a drink.</font>

907
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,662
<font color="yellow">Mr Hong, Hye Jung is not answering her phone.</font>

908
00:53:23,962 --> 00:53:25,722
<font color="yellow">I have to tell her something urgently.</font>

909
00:53:25,722 --> 00:53:28,192
<font color="yellow">She's probably busy. Try calling her in a bit.</font>

910
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,562
<font color="yellow">You're saying that because you don't know her well.</font>

911
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,792
<font color="yellow">She always calls me back no matter how busy she is.</font>

912
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:35,422
<font color="yellow">She texts me when she absolutely can't answer my calls!</font>

913
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:37,062
<font color="yellow">I've never delivered to your bar before.</font>

914
00:53:37,522 --> 00:53:38,522
<font color="yellow">Please check this.</font>

915
00:53:39,822 --> 00:53:41,562
<font color="yellow">Anyway, find out where she is now.</font>

916
00:53:41,892 --> 00:53:43,392
<font color="yellow">I'll run to the hospital otherwise.</font>

917
00:53:46,162 --> 00:53:48,762
<font color="yellow">Oh, I guess you're new.</font>

918
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:49,762
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

919
00:53:50,122 --> 00:53:53,692
<font color="yellow">Well... Haven't we met before?</font>

920
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,292
<font color="yellow">Do you know me?</font>

921
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:58,722
<font color="yellow">No. No, no.</font>

922
00:54:00,422 --> 00:54:01,992
<font color="yellow">How much is my bill?</font>

923
00:54:10,722 --> 00:54:11,722
<font color="yellow">She's not answering?</font>

924
00:54:12,462 --> 00:54:14,022
<font color="yellow">That's odd. You said she's on night duty, right?</font>

925
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:17,922
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong. Let's talk later.</font>

926
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:19,322
<font color="yellow">I saw a suspicious-looking guy.</font>

927
00:54:20,192 --> 00:54:21,192
<font color="yellow">I'll meet you at the bar.</font>

928
00:54:21,922 --> 00:54:22,992
<font color="yellow">Hey! Wait!</font>

929
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:25,822
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

930
00:54:33,692 --> 00:54:34,692
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

931
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:38,762
<font color="yellow">Where is Dr Yoo?</font>

932
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:41,062
<font color="yellow">She went to dress the Boss.</font>

933
00:54:41,492 --> 00:54:43,122
<font color="yellow">Why would Dr Yoo do that?</font>

934
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:44,892
<font color="yellow">She told me to get some food.</font>

935
00:54:46,922 --> 00:54:48,062
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten yet?</font>

936
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:52,062
<font color="yellow">You know a competent doctor always finds time to eat.</font>

937
00:54:52,562 --> 00:54:54,122
<font color="yellow">- Up your game, Doctor. - Okay.</font>

938
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,992
<font color="yellow">- Call Dr Yoo. - I...</font>

939
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,662
<font color="yellow">I can't leave my patients in your hands.</font>

940
00:55:01,722 --> 00:55:03,062
<font color="yellow">The person you're calling is currently...</font>

941
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:04,692
<font color="yellow">She's not answering. Should I go find her?</font>

942
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:06,592
<font color="yellow">Tell her to check on the patient with the cerebral aneurysm issue.</font>

943
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,022
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

944
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:09,922
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Just go and eat.</font>

945
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:12,062
<font color="yellow">- No, I will go and check. - I said, go and eat.</font>

946
00:55:13,162 --> 00:55:15,662
<font color="yellow">- Don't make me say things twice. - Okay. Thank you.</font>

947
00:55:21,462 --> 00:55:22,622
<font color="yellow">Do you know who he is?</font>

948
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:24,862
<font color="yellow">If you find out, you will regret saving him.</font>

949
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:28,322
<font color="yellow">He's an evil.</font>

950
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,892
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know how he killed my little brother?</font>

951
00:55:32,222 --> 00:55:34,022
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know how he destroyed my family?</font>

952
00:55:34,522 --> 00:55:35,662
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know what he did to me?</font>

953
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:42,592
<font color="yellow">Let me show you.</font>

954
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:49,992
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting...</font>

955
00:55:51,122 --> 00:55:52,162
<font color="yellow">for this day.</font>

956
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:55,492
<font color="yellow">You can't be lucky forever.</font>

957
00:55:57,192 --> 00:55:58,922
<font color="yellow">What? Is there something you want to say to me?</font>

958
00:56:04,392 --> 00:56:07,062
<font color="yellow">Your little brother came to me.</font>

959
00:56:07,962 --> 00:56:09,562
<font color="yellow">He's the one who came to me first.</font>

960
00:56:09,822 --> 00:56:10,892
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

961
00:56:12,092 --> 00:56:13,792
<font color="yellow">You acted like a respectable big brother,</font>

962
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:16,522
<font color="yellow">and you buried him when he became useless!</font>

963
00:56:16,522 --> 00:56:18,222
<font color="yellow">- Don't hit his head. - Sit down.</font>

964
00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:20,692
<font color="yellow">Or I will kill him.</font>

965
00:56:25,422 --> 00:56:27,422
<font color="yellow">If I can't hit his head, can I hit this part?</font>

966
00:56:29,162 --> 00:56:30,162
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

967
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:33,092
<font color="yellow">He just got a surgery. Things can go wrong.</font>

968
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:36,862
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong with him, you have to be punished for it.</font>

969
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:38,322
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare try to persuade me.</font>

970
00:56:38,422 --> 00:56:40,492
<font color="yellow">Why do you suffer because of that rubbish man?</font>

971
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:43,662
<font color="yellow">If you get charged with murder, you'll be locked in prison for life.</font>

972
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:45,962
<font color="yellow">And his men in jail will not...</font>

973
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:47,922
<font color="yellow">forgive you.</font>

974
00:56:53,162 --> 00:56:54,522
<font color="yellow">Threatening him is enough.</font>

975
00:56:56,692 --> 00:56:57,762
<font color="yellow">He's terrified.</font>

976
00:56:58,722 --> 00:57:00,162
<font color="yellow">He's scared that he might die.</font>

977
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:01,862
<font color="yellow">As long as he's alive,</font>

978
00:57:02,322 --> 00:57:04,562
<font color="yellow">people like you will keep coming.</font>

979
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:09,062
<font color="yellow">Don't get his blood on your hands. Give me...</font>

980
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:12,492
<font color="yellow">the knife.</font>

981
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:33,562
<font color="yellow">It's a little complicated here, isn't it?</font>

982
00:57:34,562 --> 00:57:37,122
<font color="yellow">I don't want to interfere, so I will be outside.</font>

983
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:39,392
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

984
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,362
<font color="yellow">Come stand next to her.</font>

985
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,722
<font color="yellow">Or this guy will die.</font>

986
00:57:55,492 --> 00:57:56,492
<font color="yellow">Take him out.</font>

987
00:57:56,722 --> 00:57:58,492
<font color="yellow">I will deal with him. You take him out.</font>

988
00:58:04,722 --> 00:58:05,762
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

989
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,792
<font color="yellow">Mr Gong. Mr Gong!</font>

990
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:36,822
<font color="yellow">People say that...</font>

991
00:58:37,622 --> 00:58:40,822
<font color="yellow">forgiveness is not for the person you're forgiving but for yourself.</font>

992
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:43,362
<font color="yellow">It's not right to give such an advice.</font>

993
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:47,962
<font color="yellow">Forgiveness is not as easy as you think.</font>

995
00:59:13,622 --> 00:59:14,692
<font color="yellow">Dr Jung.</font>

996
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:16,992
<font color="yellow">This is called "upper backspin elbow".</font>

997
00:59:16,992 --> 00:59:19,122
<font color="yellow">Is there anything you want to ask me?</font>

998
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,162
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

999
00:59:20,162 --> 00:59:21,222
<font color="yellow">You are Hye Jung.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Are they your family? - I wish.</font>

1001

<font color="yellow">So are you in love with her now? Stay out of her business.</font>

<font color="yellow">When will you open up to me?</font>

1003
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:32,762
<font color="yellow">Right now, I am going to do something to you.</font>

1004
00:59:33,222 --> 00:59:34,362
<font color="yellow">I will do something to you as a man.</font>
