27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,640
<font color="yellow">First, I'd like to thank you.</font>

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,740
<font color="yellow">I personally think it's an honour...</font>

32
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,370
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

33
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,950
<font color="yellow">Why weren't you able to respond...</font>

<font color="yellow">when he complained about being in pain?</font>

35

<font color="yellow">I was operating on a patient with a ruptured cerebral aneurysm.</font>

36

<font color="yellow">before starting the operation.</font>

38
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing up someone else right now?</font>

39
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,880
<font color="yellow">The problem is that you handed your responsibilities to someone else.</font>

40
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,620
<font color="yellow">Did you have to operate on the patient at that exact time?</font>

<font color="yellow">It was my patient,</font>

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,550

<font color="yellow">I couldn't delay it.</font>

44
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,440

46

<font color="yellow">Why should Dr Yoo get disciplinary action?</font>

51
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,810
<font color="yellow">I know. They should blame Dr Jin.</font>

52

<font color="yellow">He's leaving his daughter out.</font>

53

88

92
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,240
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is my fault?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

94
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,610

<font color="yellow">But I can't get anything done if I think that.</font>

102
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,970

103
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,850
<font color="yellow">Does everyone else around you blame others in these situations?</font>

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,410

108
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,710
<font color="yellow">I never criticised you.</font>

109
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,910

<font color="yellow">You're lucky you're so smart.</font>

111

<font color="yellow">- You held a disciplinary meeting?
-  Yes.</font>

112
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,310
<font color="yellow">Was it necessary to make such a big deal out of this?</font>

113
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,530
<font color="yellow">You should've ignored it.</font>

114
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,330
<font color="yellow">We have to make sure the employees are alert by showing an example.</font>

115
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,340
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

116
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,170
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling about this situation.</font>

117
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,070
<font color="yellow">I think it's since then.</font>

118
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,910
<font color="yellow">We took a big risk...</font>

119
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,010
<font color="yellow">when we put the hospital through the tax investigation to get Doo Sik.</font>

120
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,880
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Father. You've become soft.</font>

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,670
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be who I am if it weren't for that.</font>

122
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,710
<font color="yellow">- Fine. Do a good job.
-  Okay.</font>

123
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,250
<font color="yellow">The different levels of disciplinary action are...</font>

124
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,870
<font color="yellow">warning, reduction in salary, suspension and termination.</font>

125
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,640
<font color="yellow">I believe a warning is enough for Dr Yoo.</font>

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,140
<font color="yellow">How can we do that when she's all over the media?</font>

127
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,110
<font color="yellow">She's not even showing any regret.</font>

128
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,850
<font color="yellow">We should fire her.</font>

129
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,930
<font color="yellow">If we fire her for this, she can fight back...</font>

130
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,280
<font color="yellow">that there is a problem in the disciplinary measures.</font>

131
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,120
<font color="yellow">This is an issue for the entire Department of Neurosurgery.</font>

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,770
<font color="yellow">I don't think we should have an individual take all the blame.</font>

133
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,740
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that because of your personal feelings for her?</font>

134
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,740
<font color="yellow">You're the one who's letting your personal emotions take over.</font>

135
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,310
<font color="yellow">He's not picking up.</font>

136
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,610
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

137
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,840
<font color="yellow">Is Kim Soo Kyeong's CT out yet?</font>

138
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,530
<font color="yellow">I'll take her over right now.</font>

139
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,010
<font color="yellow">Your phone. Why do you never pick up?</font>

140
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,460
<font color="yellow">You turned our department upside-down, so wake up!</font>

141
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,910
<font color="yellow">Did you forget again? What a moron.</font>

142
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,520
<font color="yellow">Focus on work, not your webtoon.</font>

143
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,010
<font color="yellow">Do you have time to waste?</font>

144
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,160
<font color="yellow">That's weird. Why didn't he talk back?</font>

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,480
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

146
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,840
<font color="yellow">He must be dying inside.</font>

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,410
<font color="yellow">He adores Dr Yoo and he might have cut her career short.</font>

148
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,100
<font color="yellow">I'll keep pushing him.</font>

149
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,310
<font color="yellow">They're too laid back. That's why we have issues.</font>

150
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,940
<font color="yellow">- It's been a while.
-  Hello.</font>

151
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,100
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting. I am glad you finally called.</font>

152
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,460

316
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,470
<font color="yellow">I do. I hate it, too.</font>

317

324

325

<font color="yellow">I had to keep doing things.</font>

326
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,910
<font color="yellow">But now, I like sitting here and doing nothing like this.</font>

327
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,410
<font color="yellow">I can understand why Father used to like going fishing.</font>

328
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,710
<font color="yellow">Why is it that people always begin to understand each other better...</font>

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,640

334
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,370
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim Chi Hyun proposed a deal.</font>

335
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,940
<font color="yellow">What does he want in return for the anaesthesiology report?</font>

336
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,310
<font color="yellow">I suggested an alternative instead of accepting his request.</font>

337
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting for him to consider it and accept it at the moment.</font>

493

<font color="yellow">Choosing a laparoscope operation for stomach cancer...</font>

498
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,610

499
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,210

501
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,040

502
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,240
<font color="yellow">What's a little strange is that...</font>

503
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,090
<font color="yellow">he didn't open her up right after the inferior vena cava ruptured...</font>

504
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,470
<font color="yellow">despite the excessive bleeding.</font>

505
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,740
<font color="yellow">Was that the surgeon's conviction?</font>

506
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,710
<font color="yellow">I am not sure.</font>

507
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:22,340
<font color="yellow">Ask the operating surgeon.</font>

508
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,440
<font color="yellow">Here's my opinion on this record...</font>

509
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,510
<font color="yellow">is that the operating surgeon touched a big vein by mistake...</font>

510
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:33,370
<font color="yellow">and caused excessive bleeding.</font>

511
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,710
<font color="yellow">Had he made a quick decision to make the right decision...</font>

512
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,970
<font color="yellow">and opened her up right away,</font>

513
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,340
<font color="yellow">the extreme situation wouldn't have happened.</font>

514
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,670
<font color="yellow">So the operating surgeon made a wrong decision.</font>

515
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,510

529

<font color="yellow">I didn't really have to broadcast it.</font>

531
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,970
<font color="yellow">You would have not come to me...</font>

532
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,510
<font color="yellow">if you are a realistic person.</font>

533
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,540
<font color="yellow">Please do not talk to me too casually.</font>

534
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,140
<font color="yellow">This isn't exactly a casual relationship.</font>

537
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,770
<font color="yellow">You told me 13 years ago...</font>

538
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,640
<font color="yellow">that you would accept the punishment...</font>

539
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,450
<font color="yellow">if I prove that you didn't do your best.</font>

540
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,540
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

541
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,470
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

542
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,970
<font color="yellow">So what, Doctor?</font>

543
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,970
<font color="yellow">This is the proof.</font>

544
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,350
<font color="yellow">How can that prove that I didn't do my best?</font>

545
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,510
<font color="yellow">Did you explain to my grandmother...</font>

546
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,740
<font color="yellow">about the laparoscope operation?</font>

547
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,140
<font color="yellow">You just said you were going to open her up.</font>

548
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,140
<font color="yellow">We never heard about the new surgery procedure.</font>

549
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,940

551

552
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,610
<font color="yellow">It wasn't covered by insurance. You didn't do it for the money?</font>

555
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:58,000
<font color="yellow">You've clearly made a mistake.</font>

556
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,410

559
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,470

560
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,370
<font color="yellow">That must've been because I wasn't threatening.</font>

561
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,370
<font color="yellow">The statue of limitation has already expired,</font>

562

575
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,370
<font color="yellow">Now, I don't owe you anything, right?</font>

576
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,080
<font color="yellow">You're doing everything on your own.</font>

577
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,240

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,670
<font color="yellow">That's a good catch.</font>

580
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,080
<font color="yellow">Focus on more positive aspects. Life is short.</font>

581
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,340
<font color="yellow">I was so naive.</font>

582
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,340
<font color="yellow">I underestimated you.</font>

583
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,470
<font color="yellow">You are truly amazing.</font>

584
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,580
<font color="yellow">I thought an apology would be all I needed.</font>

585
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,110
<font color="yellow">But after getting an apology from you,</font>

586
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,040
<font color="yellow">I feel even more upset.</font>

587
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,240
<font color="yellow">I expected you to sincerely apologise...</font>

588
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,510
<font color="yellow">to the victims of your mistakes.</font>

589
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:33,610
<font color="yellow">That was my mistake.</font>

590
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,510
<font color="yellow">Ask Prof. Hong.</font>

591
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,010
<font color="yellow">He's just like me.</font>

592

593
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,730

<font color="yellow">Don't come back for this.</font>

595
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,240
<font color="yellow">It would be even better if you never come back to this hospital.</font>

596
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,840
<font color="yellow">Do you want to work...</font>

597
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,210
<font color="yellow">for the hospital run by me?</font>

598
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,410
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

599
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,010
<font color="yellow">You dread law, so I will get you with the law.</font>

600
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,280
<font color="yellow">Did you talk well?</font>

601
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,810
<font color="yellow">Do you know any attorneys?</font>

602
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,580
<font color="yellow">I want a good one.</font>

603
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,770
<font color="yellow">Why do you need one?</font>

604
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,870
<font color="yellow">I have to see if I can sue him.</font>

605
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,210
<font color="yellow">Did he not apologise?</font>

606
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,840

759
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,370
<font color="yellow">Is there any way we can start a case on this?</font>

760
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,630
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

761
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,740

763
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,940
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking how to approach it.</font>

764
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,710
<font color="yellow">The anaesthesiology report is different from the operation record,</font>

765
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,710
<font color="yellow">which means that one of them was probably manipulated.</font>

766
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,000
<font color="yellow">Are there any legal penalties that apply for committing such forgery?</font>

767
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,910
<font color="yellow">It's against Article 88 and 22 of the Medical Service Act.</font>

768
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,670
<font color="yellow">The punishment will be either a jail term of under three years,</font>

769
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,970
<font color="yellow">or a fine of up to 10,000 dollars.</font>

770
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,310
<font color="yellow">There's a statute of limitations for these penalties as well.</font>

771
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,710
<font color="yellow">When was the operation record written?</font>

772
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,970
<font color="yellow">It was probably written at that time.</font>

773
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,210
