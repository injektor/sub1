00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,550
<font color="yellow">Yes. I gave him a painkiller.</font>

158
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420

-  Thanks.</font>

161
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,120
<font color="yellow">No need for tea. We had snacks after the inauguration.</font>

162
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,180
<font color="yellow">- I see.
-  Did I disturb you?</font>

163
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,750
<font color="yellow">I was working.</font>

164
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,250
<font color="yellow">Try lying just to be polite.</font>

165
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,350
<font color="yellow">I know you're a perfect guy, but it's not an excuse.</font>

166
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,110
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

167
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,720
<font color="yellow">How are things with Seo Woo?</font>

168
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,550
<font color="yellow">We decided to break up.</font>

169
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,720

170
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,920
<font color="yellow">You have parents. You aren't an orphan.</font>

171
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,390
<font color="yellow">I have to go somewhere.</font>

172
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,980
<font color="yellow">You'll never find another girl like her.</font>

173
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,920
<font color="yellow">I know I'm her mother, but I believe that she's a gem.</font>

174
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,950
<font color="yellow">I really don't want the parents to get involved.</font>

175
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,350
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to my family.</font>

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,820
<font color="yellow">Wait until you're older. Family is all you'll have.</font>

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,480
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the advice.</font>

178

182

186

<font color="yellow">What will you do about building a new centre?</font>

188
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,920
<font color="yellow">I'll call a board meeting to finalise the issue.</font>

189

193
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,680

<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Mr Chairman.</font>

195
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

196
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,120
<font color="yellow">You've been very busy recently.</font>

197
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,710
<font color="yellow">I brought you some health supplements.</font>

203
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,210
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Sir.</font>

204
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,950
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong was pretty aggressive back then.</font>

205
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,380
<font color="yellow">I don't care. Lie low in Namyangju.</font>

206
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,620

208

209
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,680
<font color="yellow">Don't beat around the bush. What do you have?</font>

210
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,220
<font color="yellow">Our operation records are disposed of after 10 years.</font>

211
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,750
<font color="yellow">Did you keep it all these years? The statue has expired.</font>

212
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,560
<font color="yellow">It can't harm me.</font>

213
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,820

<font color="yellow">despite being a staff member.</font>

309
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,860
<font color="yellow">Stop boasting.</font>

310
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,720
<font color="yellow">Why should I?</font>

311
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,550
<font color="yellow">Wake up already.</font>

312
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,030
<font color="yellow">Isn't it time to reconsider our cleaning contractor?</font>

313
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,120
<font color="yellow">I will speak to them, Sir.</font>

314
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,250
<font color="yellow">- Jin Myung Hoon's time has arrived.
-  He seems to be in a good mood.</font>

315
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,420
<font color="yellow">Go and bring Prof. Hong Ji Hong.</font>

316
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,220
<font color="yellow">President Jin.</font>

317
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,820
<font color="yellow">- Did everything go well?
-  Yes.</font>

318
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,280
<font color="yellow">Why are you prying into my background?</font>

319
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,970
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to find out what happened in Patient Kang Mal Soon's surgery.</font>

320
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,590
<font color="yellow">How is that considered prying?</font>

321
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,520
<font color="yellow">You should ask me directly since I was the operating surgeon.</font>

322
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,250
<font color="yellow">I heard you went to see the doctor who was my assistant back then.</font>

323
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,220
<font color="yellow">What would you like to know?</font>

324
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,120
<font color="yellow">Do you remember that surgery?</font>

325
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,590
<font color="yellow">I don't remember.</font>

326
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,880
<font color="yellow">I choose to remember happier things.</font>

327
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,420
<font color="yellow">I hope we get along well.</font>

328
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,280
<font color="yellow">We should continue the friendship and success our fathers shared.</font>

329
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,150
<font color="yellow">That would require mutual trust.</font>

330
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,880
<font color="yellow">Let's trust each other.</font>

331
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,450
<font color="yellow">You're my type of person. I like smart people.</font>

332
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,070
<font color="yellow">A 21-year-old male traffic accident patient has multiple fractures.</font>

333
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,970
<font color="yellow">We took a CT scan since he's unconscious,</font>

334
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,020
<font color="yellow">and it seems like one of his middle cerebral arteries is ruptured.</font>

335
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,760
<font color="yellow">His right pupil is dilated by about 4mm.</font>

336
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,250
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, his vitals are stable.</font>

337
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,730
<font color="yellow">- How is the bleeding?
-  It's around 30cc.</font>

338
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,820
<font color="yellow">Will you perform ligation?</font>

339
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,880
<font color="yellow">One of the staff members will have to decide.</font>

340
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,090
<font color="yellow">Staff member? Shall I call Prof. Hong?</font>

341
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,980
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

342
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,220
<font color="yellow">You saw the CT scan results, right? The neck is wide.</font>

343
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,650
<font color="yellow">Call Anaesthesiology. Prepare for surgery right away.</font>

344
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr Hong.</font>

345
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,680
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

346
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,750
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen you since Chairman Hong passed away.</font>

347
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, there were a lot of things to take care of.</font>

348
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,850
<font color="yellow">Thanks for all the hard work.</font>

349
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,780
<font color="yellow">Bipolar cautery, please.</font>

350
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,380
<font color="yellow">When we open the sylvian fissure,</font>

351
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,850
<font color="yellow">we must be careful not to damage the veins.</font>

352
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,180
<font color="yellow">They're near the temporal lobe.</font>

353
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,520
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Professor.
-  Irrigation, please.</font>

354
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you waiting out here?</font>

355
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,420
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Let's go in.</font>

356
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,080
<font color="yellow">That's okay. It seems like you're expected. Please, go in.</font>

357
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,550
<font color="yellow">It's not a planned visit.</font>

358
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,420
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong and I don't set up appointments to see each other.</font>

359
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,620
<font color="yellow">He's just a guy friend.</font>

360
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,550
<font color="yellow">Between you and Ji Hong,</font>

361
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,420
<font color="yellow">if I must someone right at this moment,</font>

362
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,180
<font color="yellow">it would be you.</font>

363
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,120
<font color="yellow">I've been wanting to see you,
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

364
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,450
<font color="yellow">but I didn't reach out to you because I didn't want to.</font>

365
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,820
<font color="yellow">I thought that I'd run into you anyway through Ji Hong.</font>

366
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,450
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you reach out to me if you wanted to meet?</font>

367
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,920
<font color="yellow">It's because I had to face the childishness of my youth.</font>

368
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:10,180
<font color="yellow">Back then, I thought I was an old-enough adult.</font>

369
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,580
<font color="yellow">But I was only 27 years old.</font>

370
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

371
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,680
<font color="yellow">Shall I forgive you, or not?</font>

372
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,150
<font color="yellow">Just forgive me! I'm stressed out these days.</font>

373
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,450
<font color="yellow">In neurological terms,</font>

374
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,420
<font color="yellow">I'm in a stupor.</font>

375
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,550
<font color="yellow">We'll have to drink to that.</font>

376
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,120
<font color="yellow">You haven't forgotten about buying dinner, have you?</font>

377
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,910
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

378
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,450
<font color="yellow">Come on in.</font>

379
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,180
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's up?</font>

380
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,580
<font color="yellow">Who wants ramyeon?</font>

381
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,780
<font color="yellow">I want one without an egg,</font>

382
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
<font color="yellow">but with chopped green onions.</font>

383
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,450
<font color="yellow">I want one with an egg. Don't break the yolk and hold the green onions.</font>

384
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,720
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I invited you over.</font>

385
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,420
<font color="yellow">I was out of my mind to trust you, Uncle.</font>

386
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,250
<font color="yellow">Let's get a drink while he cooks for us.</font>

387
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,420
<font color="yellow">In Joo will be here soon.</font>

388
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,950
<font color="yellow">You're making quite an effort today.</font>

389
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,980
<font color="yellow">Why does your place look bigger than mine?</font>

390
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,470
<font color="yellow">Why is there a difference when we work at the same hospital?</font>

391
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,580
<font color="yellow">Let's discuss this after I've seen your place.</font>

392
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,980
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to come over?</font>

393
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,520
<font color="yellow">In Joo.</font>

394
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,920
<font color="yellow">Where do you live?</font>

395
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,920
<font color="yellow">Over there on the third floor.</font>

396
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,250
<font color="yellow">In Joo.</font>

397
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,980
<font color="yellow">I can't stand up.</font>

398
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,150
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

399
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,250
<font color="yellow">Hong Ji Hong!</font>

400
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,050
<font color="yellow">Hong Ji Hong!</font>

401
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,720
<font color="yellow">Jeong Pa Ran!</font>

402
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,550
<font color="yellow">In Joo, you're going to wake up everyone in the neighbourhood.</font>

403
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,250
<font color="yellow">How much did she drink?</font>

404
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,420
<font color="yellow">Stand up, Missy.</font>

405
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,950
<font color="yellow">What? Missy?</font>

406
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,920
<font color="yellow">That hurts. Let go of me.</font>

407
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,450
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. Help me, Yoon Do. Let go of me.</font>

408
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,920
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Dr Yoo.
-  The greetings can wait.</font>

409
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,290
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

410
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,320
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

411
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,520
<font color="yellow">I can walk by myself.</font>

412
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
<font color="yellow">- All right.
-  Come with us.</font>

413
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

414
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,350
<font color="yellow">She didn't use to get that drunk.</font>

415
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,920
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go in?</font>

416
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,680
<font color="yellow">No, I'll leave.</font>

417
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

418
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
<font color="yellow">All right then?</font>

419
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,920
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?</font>

420
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,620
<font color="yellow">You said you wanted to leave.</font>

421
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,980
<font color="yellow">Since when did you do as I say?</font>

422
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,050
<font color="yellow">So what is it that you want?</font>

423
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go home or do you want to talk?</font>

424
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

425
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
<font color="yellow">Would you like some tea?</font>

426
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,280
<font color="yellow">You have this at home?</font>

427
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do. Do you want to give it a try?</font>

428
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,150
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

429
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

430
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

431
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,050
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

432
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,180
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to comfort someone when they're sad.</font>

433
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,120
<font color="yellow">I've never had someone console me when I was sad.</font>

434
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,980
<font color="yellow">I was alone when my grandma passed away.</font>

435
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:45,320
<font color="yellow">I thought sadness was something you had to get over alone.</font>

436
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,250
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

437
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,550
<font color="yellow">I was alone like I always was.</font>

438
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,320
<font color="yellow">I went through my father's belongings by myself.</font>

439
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,420
<font color="yellow">My old self would've felt comfortable and at ease,</font>

440
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,420
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't stop thinking about you.</font>

441
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,920
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call?</font>

442
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,780
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you to call.</font>

443
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,050
<font color="yellow">Whenever I wanted something,</font>

444
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,520
<font color="yellow">I'd act first.</font>

445
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,120
<font color="yellow">That's how I ended up telling you how I felt about you.</font>

446
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,420
<font color="yellow">But I realised...</font>

447
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,250
<font color="yellow">that waiting for the woman I love could be the most active act.</font>

448
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,280
<font color="yellow">I learned that through you.</font>

449
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,750
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what to do.</font>

450
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,020
<font color="yellow">I'd pushed you into a corner, telling you to change.</font>

451
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,280
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

452
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,120
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to love me the way I am,</font>

453
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,620
<font color="yellow">but I asked you to change.</font>

454
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,480
<font color="yellow">You're good at figuring things out and admitting to your faults.</font>

455
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,420
<font color="yellow">You were always like that. It's one of your strengths.</font>

456
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,250
<font color="yellow">I want to be part of your life.</font>

457
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,350
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for telling you to change.</font>

458
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,720
<font color="yellow">You can think and make decisions by yourself.</font>

459
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,880
<font color="yellow">I'll just be by your side.</font>

460
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,580
<font color="yellow">Can I do that?</font>

461
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

462
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,950
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

463
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,780
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

464
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,220
<font color="yellow">But you haven't had the tea yet.</font>

465
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,020
<font color="yellow">I can't ask you to stay, can I?</font>

466
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,620
<font color="yellow">No, you can't.</font>

467
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,100
<font color="yellow">Do you know how scared I was?</font>

468
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,420
<font color="yellow">I thought your feelings had changed when you didn't answer your phone.</font>

469
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,220
<font color="yellow">I didn't answer my phone?</font>

470
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,050
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

471
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't know.</font>

472
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,160
<font color="yellow">Please answer your phone from now on.</font>

473
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,750
<font color="yellow">So many thoughts went through my head.</font>

474
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,980
<font color="yellow">You lied to me today, didn't you?</font>

475
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,810
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

476
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,930
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure?
-  Yes, I am.</font>

477
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,250
<font color="yellow">You wanted to give the claw machine a try.</font>

478
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,520
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

479
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,550
<font color="yellow">Give it a try.</font>

480
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,250
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

481
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,050
<font color="yellow">- This is interesting, isn't it?
-  Yes it is.</font>

482
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,580
<font color="yellow">All right. Use this hand.</font>

483
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,350
<font color="yellow">Too bad.</font>

484
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

485
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
<font color="yellow">Go up.</font>

486
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
<font color="yellow">- There.
-  Right here?</font>

487
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,480
<font color="yellow">Try going up a little.</font>

488
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,880
<font color="yellow">I didn't get it.</font>

489
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,940
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to do this?</font>

490
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,620
<font color="yellow">Just do it. Look.</font>

491
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,220
<font color="yellow">That was so close.</font>

492
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,490
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you guys.</font>

493
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,720
<font color="yellow">- Uncle.
-  Don't wake me up.</font>

494
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,820
<font color="yellow">Get up. You're going to be late.</font>

495
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,490
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

496
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,580
<font color="yellow">Aunt, wake up.</font>

497
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,620
<font color="yellow">What time is it?</font>

498
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,850
<font color="yellow">It's 6:50am. I can sleep a little longer.</font>

499
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,950
<font color="yellow">Aunt, why are you doing this too?</font>

500
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,280
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling "aunt"?</font>

501
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,380
<font color="yellow">You're a grown man.</font>

502
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,550
<font color="yellow">How disturbing.</font>

503
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,180
<font color="yellow">I provided you with accommodation and food.</font>

504
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,380
<font color="yellow">- How can you be like that?
-  Why am I your aunt?</font>

505
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,260
<font color="yellow">I'm more like your elder sister.</font>

506
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,580
<font color="yellow">You're my uncle's friend, so you're more like an aunt.</font>

507
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,580
<font color="yellow">What kind of a logic is that?</font>

508
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,850
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take a shower.</font>

509
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,180
<font color="yellow">Squeeze me some orange juice so I can drink it when I get out.</font>

510
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,620
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

511
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,850
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my uncle is so useless.</font>

512
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,490
<font color="yellow">Even his friends are strange.</font>

513
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,420
<font color="yellow">She's just as bad as Prof. Hong downstairs.</font>

514
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,420
<font color="yellow">She's as bad as him.</font>

515
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,490
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

516
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,520
<font color="yellow">Orange juice.</font>

517
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,520
<font color="yellow">Go to sleep.</font>

518
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,370
<font color="yellow">I've been tracking Ms Cho Soo Ji's motor progress,</font>

519
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,720
<font color="yellow">but there isn't much improvement.</font>

520
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

521
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,650
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo.</font>

522
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

523
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
<font color="yellow">Join us.</font>

524
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,780
<font color="yellow">(With Investment Security)</font>

525
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
<font color="yellow">(Your purchase order is successful.)</font>

526
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,050
<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

527
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,020
<font color="yellow">You see?</font>

528
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,080
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

529
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,850
<font color="yellow">I do everything for you, Darling.</font>

530
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:26,850
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

531
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,680
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes.</font>

532
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,180
<font color="yellow">Honey, let's talk. Open your eyes.</font>

533
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

534
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
<font color="yellow">How do I look today?</font>

535
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,550
<font color="yellow">If I look great, blink once.</font>

536
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,450
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
-  Hello, Doctors.</font>

537
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,720
<font color="yellow">All right, let's see.</font>

538
00:37:58,850 --> 00:37:59,920
<font color="yellow">How are you feeling today?</font>

539
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,620
<font color="yellow">Yes, it looks normal.</font>

540
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,620
<font color="yellow">Let's check this side too.</font>

541
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,620
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

542
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,250
<font color="yellow">There's no noticeable change.</font>

543
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,780
<font color="yellow">You'll have to keep this up a little longer.</font>

544
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,320
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Doctor.
-  Sure.</font>

545
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,720
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

546
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,690
<font color="yellow">Can we separate her from her guardian for a while?</font>

547
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,250
<font color="yellow">He practically lives in the room.</font>

548
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,550
<font color="yellow">So can we, or not?</font>

549
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,320
<font color="yellow">We can.</font>

550
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,850
<font color="yellow">Wait a bit longer. It's not time yet.</font>

551
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

552
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,720
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to regret it, then go ahead.</font>

553
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,620
<font color="yellow">Let's speak later.</font>

554
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,250
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

555
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,050
<font color="yellow">want your advice on stock investments.</font>

556
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,450
<font color="yellow">I have quite a bit of debt.</font>

557
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,130
<font color="yellow">- Stocks?
-  I accumulated sudden debt.</font>

558
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,320
<font color="yellow">Please help me this once.</font>

559
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,900
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

560
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,880
<font color="yellow">- May we consult with you outside?
-  Sure.</font>

561
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,700
<font color="yellow">- I should stay beside my wife.
-  We might distract her.</font>

562
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,750
<font color="yellow">Yes. Let's go. I'll buy you coffee.</font>

563
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,820
<font color="yellow">I am interested in stock investments,</font>

564
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,350
<font color="yellow">but I have no idea where to start.</font>

565
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,250
<font color="yellow">There's a good coffee shop over there.</font>

566
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,350
<font color="yellow">This is how we'll communicate from now on.</font>

567
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,940
<font color="yellow">Please blink once for yes,</font>

568
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,650
<font color="yellow">and blink twice for no.</font>

569
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,220
<font color="yellow">Are you discomforted in any way?</font>

570
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,720
<font color="yellow">Is it related to your husband?</font>

571
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,820
<font color="yellow">He's coming, Mr Hong.</font>

572
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,950
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

573
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,850
<font color="yellow">I got it. This fell.</font>

574
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,550
<font color="yellow">She's not going to get worse, right?</font>

575
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,220
<font color="yellow">I think we'll have to run some tests.</font>

576
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,020
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't worry too much. Let's get another CT scan.</font>

577
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,120
<font color="yellow">- Dr Yoo.
-  Yes, Professor.</font>

578
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,850
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Sir.</font>

579
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,530
<font color="yellow">You are not permitted inside.</font>

580
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,120
<font color="yellow">If you rest in the waiting room,</font>

581
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,220
<font color="yellow">she'll be right with you soon.</font>

582
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,050
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
-  Let's go.</font>

583
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,020
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

584
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,120
<font color="yellow">(Assailant)</font>

585
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,820
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

586
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,100
<font color="yellow">She'll be fine.</font>

587
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,320
<font color="yellow">We'll notify you immediately when the CT scan results are out.</font>

588
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,750
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

589
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:11,680
<font color="yellow">We called the police.</font>

590
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:14,490
<font color="yellow">Ms Cho has was reported as a missing person.</font>

591
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,950
<font color="yellow">- She's a missing person?
-  Yes.</font>

592
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,900
<font color="yellow">Her parents sent the report.</font>

593
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,620
<font color="yellow">Why would they report her missing when she has her husband?</font>

594
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,550
<font color="yellow">My beautiful darling.</font>

595
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,420
<font color="yellow">You are so beautiful.</font>

596
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,680
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

597
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,880
<font color="yellow">Do you remember when we first met?</font>

598
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:43,920
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was struck by a lightning.</font>

599
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,650
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop.</font>

600
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,080
<font color="yellow">I like you so much.</font>

601
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:15,530
<font color="yellow">Please give me an opportunity.</font>

602
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,400
<font color="yellow">Why would you do this to me?</font>

603
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,420
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

604
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,980
<font color="yellow">I will bet everything I have...</font>

605
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,880
<font color="yellow">and protect you, Soo Ji.</font>

606
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

607
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,410
<font color="yellow">when I went to the borough office and registered...</font>

608
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,420
<font color="yellow">ourselves as married after pestering you about it,</font>

609
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,420
<font color="yellow">I felt as if the entire world had become mine.</font>

610
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,250
<font color="yellow">A man who bets his everything on me will only do me harm.</font>

611
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:52,350
<font color="yellow">Why didn't I know that back then?</font>

612
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,480
<font color="yellow">Ms Cho Soo Ji's parents are on their way here.</font>

613
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,020
<font color="yellow">Why did they report her missing when she has her husband?</font>

615
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,580
<font color="yellow">He registered themselves as married without her knowledge.</font>

616
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,870
<font color="yellow">So does Ms Cho not know him at all?</font>

617
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:09,120
<font color="yellow">That's not really the case.</font>

618
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,780
<font color="yellow">According to her parents,</font>

619
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,930
<font color="yellow">they went out for a few months because he chased her.</font>

620
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,880
<font color="yellow">But she broke up with him because he was too obsessed with her.</font>

621
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,420
<font color="yellow">So he got back at her for breaking up with him.</font>

622
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,880
<font color="yellow">That's correct.</font>

623
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,080
<font color="yellow">We can't let him be near her.</font>

624
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,250
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? They're here now.</font>

625
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,220
<font color="yellow">He's not wary of me. I'll go and bring him out.</font>

626
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,620
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if you could do that for us.</font>

627

<font color="yellow">- I'll go.
-  No.</font>

628
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,720
<font color="yellow">I should allow other people to protect me.</font>

629
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,050
<font color="yellow">Please do it for me, then.</font>

630
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,020
<font color="yellow">Doctor, I don't have to look at the CT scan while you explain.</font>

631
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,950
<font color="yellow">It'd be easier to understand that way.</font>

633

769
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,220
<font color="yellow">Can you take me home?</font>

781
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,550
