00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,110
- You've gotten better looking.
- Really?

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,550
<i>[Episode 8]</i>
You have facial hair.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,630
You look like Wolverine! Wolverine.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,440
Wolverine, no.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,020
<i>When a man and woman were in love,
the thing I envied the most</i>

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,750
<i>was when a man met someone that made
him behave in an immature manner.</i>

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,120
I am very manly.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,200
It's okay! They're just friends.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>This immature behavior between
a man and a woman is healthy.</i>

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,780
<i>It's the best gift I can
show the other person.</i>

12
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,860
Yes, Doctor.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,080
You sound happy.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,650
I'm going to work with my friend.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,270
- Soon Hee?
- No.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,420
Soo Chul, my friend from
when I was a bit rebellious.

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,300
Hey, don't hang out with him.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,500
Hey, you can't tell me not to
hang out with a friend.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,260
Gosh... you're kind of...

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,890
<i>Do you like him that much?</i>

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,150
What is it? What's wrong?

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,860
Hye Jung!

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,080
Where are you right now?

24
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,460
Call an ambulance!

25
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,010
Can you recognize me?

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,760
Don't move your neck.

27
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,640
Can you move your arms and legs?

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,860
No, I can't put any strength in them.

29
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,990
What about your fingers?

30
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,700
Move your fingers.

31
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,800
No!

32
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,030
This can't happen.

33
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,850
Are you okay?

34
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,580
- Doctor!
- What happened here?

35
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,970
He has damage to his cervical vertebrae.

36
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,140
I don't think his nerves are
completely damaged.

37
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,650
What about the ambulance?

38
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,690
They've been called already.

39
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,050
Good.

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,680
I've just been holding his hand.

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,390
You did well.

42
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,140
You're a doctor.

43
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,470
Don't lose yourself here.

44
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,220
Your friend will be in danger
if you do, Hye Jung.

45
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,300
We have to be very careful moving him.
Get a neck brace.

46
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,930
Can you help me?

47
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,170
Be careful. Even one wrong move
could make things go very wrong.

48
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,910
A little bit, just a bit.

49
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,750
Do you have him? Got him?

50
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,290
Good. Put him down slowly.

51
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,880
I'm putting you down slowly.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,520
He's not breathing.

53
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,200
Get me a stethoscope! A stethoscope!

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,890
We need to get to the hospital now.

55
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,420
He'll be in real danger if we don't

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,100
stabilize his breathing
within 30 minutes.

57
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:55,980
Get a gurney.

58
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,590
He's been in a
motorcycle traffic accident.

59
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,010
Put him in the ER.

60
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,810
His rib is broken.
It must be piercing his lung.

61
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,050
His diaphragm might have a tear, as well.

62
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,530
There is blood in the lungs.

63
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,870
Get me a 28 French chest tube.

64
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,230
Hold on to to him, Hye Jung.
Hold on to the patient.

65
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,900
Give me the tube.

66
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Cut.

67
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,910
We took care of that.
Let's get a CT done.

68
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,510
<i>31-year-old man,
motorcycle TA (TRAFFIC ACCIDENT).</i>

69
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,480
His BP was over 120 but he got
a chest tube and is now at 92.

70
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,730
The CT showed a bleeding spleen,
so we will need to do a surgery for that.

71
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,010
- What about hemorrhage?
- It's grade two but they're using drugs.

72
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,320
Get an operating room now.

73
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,770
He could suffer paralysis due to
a fracture in the vertebrae.

74
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,230
The Neurosurgery team is
going into surgery first.

75
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,650
- Who is? Ji Hong?
- Yes.

76
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,770
Take an MRI of the vertebrae and
get an anesthesiologist right away.

77
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,400
Call General Surgery and
ask them to come in right after us.

78
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,300
You don't need to call us.
I'm here already.

79
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,950
Good timing. Come take a look at this.

80
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,710
The bleeding is not too bad.

81
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,220
But it could get worse while
you're doing the surgery.

82
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,210
He could go into shock.

83
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,140
I need you to work fast. Quickly.

84
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,810
I'll prepare for surgery now.

85
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,860
- Okay, hurry.
- Yes.

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,940
Now, make a choice.
Do you want to come in or not?

87
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,460
You've done a good job up until now.
You don't need to do anymore.

88
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,850
If you come in and something goes wrong,
it will be extremely difficult for you.

89
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,150
If I go in and things go well,
will I become stronger?

90
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,010
Please stop becoming stronger.

91
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,340
How can I live in this world
without being strong?

92
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,150
Being weak isn't a bad thing.
It's okay to be weak.

93
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,340
I don't want to go in.

94
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,540
Okay.

95
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,390
Doctor Hong is going to do the surgery.

96
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,220
If you get the surgery,
you can ride your motorcycle like before.

97
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,520
I don't want another doctor.

98
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,750
Doctor Hong is a really good doctor.

99
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm scared.

100
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,070
But if you were to do it,
I wouldn't be scared.

101
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,660
If there's anything I know about you,
it's that you can do anything.

102
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,250
You'll do it, right?

103
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,920
Doctor, the operating room is ready.
They want you to send the patient up.

104
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,190
I'll do it.

105
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,160
I'll be by your side.

106
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,320
I'm going in too.

107
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,090
Okay.

108
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,820
Yes?

109
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,530
Oh, what brings you by?

110
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,310
You ignore my calls,
so I came in person.

111
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,310
I was watching a new surgery.

112
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,230
I meant to call you back.

113
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,050
Did you know Director Hong is
giving a press conference today?

114
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,510
No, he doesn't report his
every action to me.

115
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,760
He caused trouble for the hospital
with this stock scandal.

116
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,100
He ought to just stay quiet.

117
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,270
Do you know how worried I am for him
because of that?

118
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,410
Director, let's not be fake
to one another.

119
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,500
You and I have been battling
for a long time now.

120
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,470
Let's have some respect for each other.

121
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,510
Should I be honest, then?

122
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,190
Stop stepping where you don't belong.

123
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,390
I'm the owner of this hospital
and you're just an employee.

124
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,340
As long as you make a good living,
why do you care who the owner is?

125
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,780
This is why I don't like you.

126
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,470
Can't you have some dignity?

127
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,520
Do you have to be so tactless and rude?

128
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,790
Go on and look for dignity.

129
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,650
Once Director Hong is gone,
you won't have any connections.

130
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,850
But I was born with a
golden spoon in my mouth.

131
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,600
Director Hong can try to take this
all the way with his press conference.

132
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,790
He needs to do that in order to
realize where his boundaries are.

133
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,290
Aren't the Medical Care stocks
essentially owned by Gookil Hospital?

134
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,810
The Medical Care stocks
are my own personal stocks.

135
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,620
They have no connection to the hospital.

136
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,640
However, I do apologize for tarnishing
the image of the hospital.

137
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,360
Is it true they're actually hospital
assets disguised as personal assets?

138
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,430
People say you will give them to
the hospital in the form of a donation.

139
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,890
Who said such a thing?

140
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:24,110
Would I, Hong Doo Shik,
do such a shameful deed?

141
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,710
You call yourselves reporters.

142
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,850
How can you all spread such nonsense?

143
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,260
You're here?

144
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,050
What will change if you hold a
press conference?

145
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,240
People believe what they want to believe.

146
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,170
There's someone behind this.

147
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,830
I have never run away
from something like this.

148
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,330
I will find out the truth.

149
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,450
I'll have to clean out the entire board.

150
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,160
Doo Shik, why do you do things
all on your own?

151
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
Shouldn't you discuss things with me?

152
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,090
You want to change out the board
without consulting me?

153
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,980
Aren't you and I on the same page?

154
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,050
I'm being falsely accused here
and you're okay with it?

155
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,050
If this were happening to you,
I'd find them all and get rid of them.

156
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,330
So, let me take care of it and just rest.

157
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,040
You too much of a perfectionist.

158
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,640
You do everything by yourself.

159
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,330
About Myung Hoon...

160
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,640
He hasn't given up on
the senior home, has he?

161
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,670
The Senior Health Center.

162
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,030
Why are you suddenly curious about that?

163
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,780
The person who would want to put me
in a difficult position...

164
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,310
is Myung Hoon.

165
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,590
Myung Hoon would never do
something like that.

166
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,370
He only lives to help this hospital grow.

167
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,490
All of you, leave.

168
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,910
Don't take Doo Shik too lightly.

169
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,790
I thought he would back off
once his name was disgraced.

170
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,360
- I was wrong.
- We need to see some blood too, then.

171
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,100
I guess we'll have to
use that move, after all.

172
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,200
<i>[LEE GA JIN]</i>

173
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,440
- Are you feeling okay?
- Yes.

174
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,390
You can be discharged tomorrow.

175
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,830
Thank you, Doctor.

176
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,990
You can come back to see me
on Wednesday, two weeks from now.

177
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,580
You could relapse.

178
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't miss any appointments and make
sure to come in for all of the tests.

179
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:35,940
Bye, then.

180
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,910
You did well.

181
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,490
Hold on. Doctor!

182
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,730
I brought this for you to say thank you.

183
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,240
Oh, uh...

184
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,200
It's really not much.

185
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,410
You're my Hye Jung's co-workers and I
haven't been able to do anything for you.

186
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,950
I feel like I owe you.

187
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes, thank you. We'll enjoy eating it.

188
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,380
By the way, where is Hye Jung right now?

189
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,000
He could bleed a lot and go into shock.
Please keep an eye on his vitals.

190
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,190
Scalpel, please.

191
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,890
Septum elevator.

192
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,740
Gown, please.

193
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,930
I'll change positions.

194
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,880
- Doctor, please raise the bed.
- Yes.

195
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,080
- Stop.
- Okay.

196
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,360
Suction on the right.

197
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,910
Suction!

198
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,860
Bring more blood. Forceps.

199
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,750
- Pressure's dropping.
- Bring more blood!

200
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,960
Who told you to sleep? Who?

201
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,610
I'm just so curious? Who?

202
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,230
I haven't been able to sleep at all.

203
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,660
A first year resident
shouldn't be able to sleep.

204
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,680
I stayed up for one whole week once.

205
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,350
It's the ones who are bad at work
who make excuses.

206
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,160
Kang Soo's not bad at his job though.

207
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,130
Look at that guy. He is so dense.

208
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,860
Why are you butting in?
What are you doing?

209
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,320
You must have so much time to kill,
Joong Dae, Ahn Joong Dae.

210
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,860
I have something for you.

211
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,760
I scanned my book for you.
It's my book.

212
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,840
You said you didn't have money to buy it.

213
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,200
All right! Thank you.

214
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,660
Joong Dae, can you give me one?

215
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,490
- No, I can't.
- You're bad. You're mean.

216
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,290
Your first year party is coming up.

217
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,900
Section Chief will give you
one as a gift. Don't worry.

218
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,130
Why doesn't the chief have one?
Didn't he get one from Section Chief Kim?

219
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:32,170
He gave something else back then.

220
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,190
- Eat this.
- What is it?

221
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,990
Doctor Yoo's father gave it to us to eat.

222
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,610
Wow, what is this?

223
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,930
You are amazingly good
at sniffing out food.

224
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,080
Aren't you in surgery?

225
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,830
I was, but Senior Hye Jung said
she'd assist so I had nothing to do.

226
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,220
Nothing to do?
Watching the surgery is work.

227
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,160
That's why you're always falling behind.

228
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,540
Do you enjoy being old and left behind
with younger kids?

229
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,210
- I like it.
- Oh my gosh!

230
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,040
- Should we eat this now?
- Gosh, seriously.

231
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,350
Let's put this in the fridge and eat it
when we're hungry. It's soup.

232
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,010
Let's freeze some of it too.

233
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,050
Should we do that?

234
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,520
I've been to this restaurant,
Granny's Rice Soup.

235
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,720
- It is really good.
- Oh, really?

236
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,790
Kang Soo, you should put it on your blog.

237
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,490
Doctor Yoo will like you for
advertising the restaurant.

238
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,280
Do you think so?

239
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,150
As soon you do that,
you'll be on the outs with Doctor Yoo.

240
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,700
They don't have a normal relationship.

241
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,850
But he's her real father.

242
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,310
Why are we even spending precious time
talking about her personal life?

243
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,540
Get back to work!

244
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,350
You're the one who brought it up.

245
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:39,960
- I hate you.
- Hate me? Are you crazy...

246
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,590
- Aren't you going to work?
- I scanned the book!

247
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,810
- Okay, that is true.
- Thank you.

248
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:47,580
I am going to put these in the fridge.

249
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,170
Gosh, I think I'm going to explode.

250
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,170
What would happen if you really exploded?

251
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,140
This is what would happen.

252
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,970
I hate you.

253
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,040
My dad and grandfather want to
have dinner with you.

254
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,200
The welcome party is tonight.

255
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,440
We can go a little later.
The adults are requesting it.

256
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,730
Do I have to say yes just because
adults requested it?

257
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,830
I told them the welcome party was tonight
and they told me to just come for dinner.

258
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,520
I'll tell them you don't want to go,
but I bet my dad will call you.

259
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,120
Where are we supposed to meet them?

260
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,050
More, please.

261
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,710
Good.

262
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,910
Take out the root.

263
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,630
Take it out.

264
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,740
Get ready for suture.

265
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,900
Give me some cottonoid. Thank you.

266
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,520
I think he had damage to his artery.

267
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,010
Will he get a cerebral infarction?

268
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,180
Don't make rash conclusions.

269
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,160
Do an angiography as soon as
surgery is complete.

270
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,290
It could be his non-dominant artery.

271
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,330
His blood pressure is dropping again.

272
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,630
Are you giving him blood?

273
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,860
It's done.

274
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,190
Do you want to finish up?

275
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,640
Yes.

276
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,960
Call General Surgery.

277
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:27,984

278
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,980
Hey.

279
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,770
Please, I'm asking you to do a good job.

280
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,220
I'll do a good job even if
no one requests it.

281
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,340
- Let's get ready.
- Okay.

282
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,930
We should get going too.

283
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,740
Good luck.

284
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,550
Doctor.

285
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,000
Where's Ji Hong?

286
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,230
He has an awake surgery
in the afternoon.

287
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,040
Ah, that's a really important surgery.

288
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,090
He has to succeed
on behalf of the hospital.

289
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,140
How did it go?

290
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,650
We should get a meal sometime.

291
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,910
Doctor!

292
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,850
Doctor, you must think of me too lightly.

293
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,330
I don't kill patients.

294
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,750
Of course, this time...

295
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,800
it was a success.

296
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,560
Doctor, Kim Soo Chul is out of surgery.
I have him ready for his angiography.

297
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,730
Let's go.

298
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,890
Doctor.

299
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,040
We've sent Kim Soo Chul up to the ICU.

300
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,250
His vitals are normal and I've told them
to call once he wakes up.

301
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,200
Good job.

302
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,950
It's a relief that the bleeding was
from his non-dominant artery.

303
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:10,530
Yeah, the other side is doing well.

304
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,930
Doctor.

305
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,590
You should be preparing for surgery.

306
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:20,710
What about you?
You're supposed to be assisting me.

307
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,630
- Doctor.
- What?

308
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,240
I'm going to do something right now.

309
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,540
Human to human.

310
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
Oh, it was wrinkled.

311
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,970
What were you imagining?

312
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,910
What do you mean
I was imagining something?

313
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,410
Seriously, I just saved your friend
and you're teasing me?

314
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,440
- Thank you.
- For what?

315
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,810
For everything.

316
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,740
What is she doing right now?
Is she playing me?

317
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,760
You can't move your arms and legs
very well, right?

318
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,020
No.

319
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,020
I told you before the surgery.
It's your first and second vertebrae.

320
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,560
So, it's the first and second vertebrae
in your neck that are broken.

321
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,170
That's where all the nerves that connect
to your body run through.

322
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,400
You said you'd screw on the broken bones.

323
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,690
The surgery was a success
and I've done my part.

324
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,300
It's your turn now.

325
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,460
Will I not be able to walk now?

326
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,860
You were by my side
when I wanted to die.

327
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,080
You didn't give me any advice.

328
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,560
You left me alone and let me
make my own choice.

329
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,010
Even though you were so young,
you had that kind of consideration.

330
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,080
I am sort of cool like that.

331
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,840
No, you are really cool.

332
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,300
Will my body and mind
be disconnected from now on?

333
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,550
If you're saying this to comfort me,
you can stop now.

334
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,100
Move your finger.

335
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,760
I can't move my arms and legs,
so how can I move my fingers?

336
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,690
I can't do it.

337
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,990
You did it.

338
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,990
I did. I did it.

339
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,190
Yeah... it's my turn now.

340
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,560
I will show you just how awesome
this Kim Soo Chul is.

341
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,940
You've always been awesome.

342
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,840
You don't need to show me anymore.
Find a nice woman.

343
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,430
Hey, you're the one who should
meet a nice guy.

344
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,780
Isn't the doctor who did surgery on me
your high school teacher?

345
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,080
You're right.

346
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,140
- He's married, right?
- No.

347
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,170
Don't date some old guy.

348
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,140
Even if you dated a billionaire,
you'd be too good for him.

349
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,770
Maybe if you were with me...

350
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,720
Kim Soo Chul, I see you are alive.

351
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,110
DBS needs to be micro-recorded.
Why is that?

352
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,300
- To find the spot causing tremors.
- Yes.

353
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,990
Once we find the area
to stop the tremors

354
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:25,110
how will we confirm that
she can do archery?

355
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,690
She'll have to shoot an arrow.

356
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,470
- During surgery?
- Of course.

357
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,350
I want you to monitor and
find the source of the tremor.

358
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,520
- Hye Jung, you watch over the patient.
- Okay.

359
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,550
Let's go.

360
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,230
Look, here's the tremor cello.

361
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,430
It's in the ventral intermediate
thalamic nucleus.

362
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,770
It's strange.

363
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,520
I can't feel anything.

364
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,180
Is something wrong?

365
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,500
The brain can't feel anything.
Don't worry.

366
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,400
You've reached the target.

367
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,220
We're almost there. Talk to the patient.

368
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,110
How do you feel?

369
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,140
My head feels empty.

370
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,900
I feel like the star of a movie,
like "The Matrix."

371
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,410
What about the tremors?

372
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,290
They're still there.

373
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,690
Okay...

374
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,210
The amp charges are at 131 to 135, right?

375
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,780
- Charge her with one volt.
- Okay.

376
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,060
The tremors are still there.

377
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,940
Has something gone wrong?

378
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,530
I can't see.

379
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,360
I can't see very well.

380
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,660
The patient is losing her eyesight.

381
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,730
The signal is off.

382
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,600
She's bleeding.

383
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,220
We could take the probe out and
continue once the bleeding stops.

384
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,360
Don't do that. Stop the bleeding now.

385
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,690
Use the biopsy needle
and use suction until you find it.

386
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,510
Give me the biopsy needle.

387
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:20,934

388
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,110
I can't see. I can't see a thing!

389
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,540
Something's wrong, isn't it?

390
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,190
Why is her hand shaking?

391
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,440
Something must be wrong.

392
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,090
Stop making a fuss, all of you.

393
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,470
You are bleeding a bit in your brain.

394
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,800
Doctor Hong will find it,
so don't worry.

395
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,020
What if my eyes stay like this?

396
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,450
Trust us, as well the choice
you made to have this surgery.

397
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,540
We could still wait...

398
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,330
We made the decision. Let's do it.

399
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,860
Vision issues during surgery
are only temporary.

400
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,350
You will see again soon.

401
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,210
Okay, wait just a moment.

402
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,080
- Doctor!
- He said to wait.

403
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,470
I've stopped the bleeding.
Let's continue.

404
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,580
I can see now.

405
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:16,310
Can you see your hand?

406
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,520
There are no more tremors!

407
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,930
Try grabbing my hand.

408
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,760
Oh! This is amazing.

409
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,930
It is amazing, right?

410
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,150
Put it down slowly.

411
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,860
Lift your right hand again and
move it back and forth slowly.

412
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,010
Slowly. That's good.

413
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,150
Put your finger on your nose.

414
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,850
Make a "V" with your fingers.

415
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:11,170
Thank you!

416
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,950
I'll bring in a bow and arrow.

417
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,490
Hey, where are the bow and arrow?
Bring it in now.

418
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,800
Take this and try it out.

419
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,990
Okay.

420
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,260
Okay, Olympic gold medalist
Lee Soo Jung will now shoot an arrow.

421
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,380
10 points!

422
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,500
You've gone through a lot.

423
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,640
All right, let's finish up now.

424
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,600
So exciting! Lee Soo Jung, Lee Soo Jung!

425
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,770
This is so exciting!

426
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,620
What was that earlier?

427
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,610
- What?
- "He said to wait."

428
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,360
Did you have to say that?

429
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,590
Do you want to look good to
Doctor Hong that badly?

430
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,180
What about you?
How can you act that way during surgery?

431
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,740
What did I do?

432
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,940
We could have taken out the probe and
waited for the bleeding to stop.

433
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,700
She had bled too much to wait.

434
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,100
Why do you think she couldn't see?

435
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,950
The blood was pressuring
her optic nerves.

436
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,950
Still, did you have to show off
and call me out like that?

437
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,100
It's important to calm the patient down.

438
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,250
If we start arguing over opinions,
the patient will become very anxious.

439
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,590
<i>[PROFESSOR HONG JI HONG]</i>

440
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,030
Yes?

441
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
Sit down.

442
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,520
Seo Woo.

443
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,580
As for your behavior today,
I can't just let it go.

444
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,240
It showed a lack of skills as a doctor.

445
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,550
It was the worst thing to do
within a team, as well.

446
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,010
Do you think what I'm saying is unfair?

447
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,430
I think you're going too far.

448
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,420
I see you haven't grasped the situation.

449
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,790
This was an awake surgery.
The patient was wide awake.

450
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,470
How would you feel if you were awake and
had people doing things to your brain?

451
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,530
Is telling you my opinion so wrong that
you question my skills as a doctor?

452
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,020
I'm not talking about your opinion.

453
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,330
Why are you pretending not to know?
Or are you really that ignorant?

454
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:21,790
If we agreed to be in this together,
we should all stick to a decision.

455
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,810
The decision was made
to stop the bleeding.

456
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:25,710
How can you keep saying to wait?

457
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,420
The patient will start to
doubt my choice.

458
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,120
Then what could happen?

459
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,030
Would you say this same thing if
Hye Jung acted the way I did?

460
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,390
Of course! This is about
your behavior at work.

461
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,410
How long are you going to compare
the way I treat you and Hye Jung?

462
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,960
Until I die.

463
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,930
Seo Woo.

464
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,750
I won't be talking to you
about these matters anymore.

465
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,950
Now I know there's
no point in talking to you.

466
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,470
Don't come into my surgeries
for the time being.

467
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,720
You can leave.

468
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,330
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

469
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,660
Hye Jung.

470
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,740
Hello, sir.

471
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,850
I really enjoyed the food you gave us.

472
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:27,250
- Thank you.
- No need to thank me.

473
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,690
If you want to eat more,
come by anytime.

474
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,860
This is my store.

475
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,500
She's being discharged tomorrow.

476
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,330
Okay.

477
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,070
How are you feeling?

478
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,100
I'm sure Hye Jung told you.

479
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,390
Why would you assume
I heard from Hye Jung?

480
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,310
Aren't you two dating?

481
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:11,210
- Does it seem that way?
- Oh, you're not.

482
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,150
I heard you're not married yet.

483
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,060
- So what? Did you get married?
- Yes.

484
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,020
You got married?

485
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,760
That's great.

486
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,700
People should get married early.

487
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,750
We'll move you into the
rehab facility in a week.

488
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,990
If you work hard on rehab,
you'll be back to your former self.

489
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,430
What a liar.

490
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,400
It's a little lie, not a big one.

491
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,970
You're a very cool guy,
getting married and all.

492
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,880
When I first saw you,
I thought you were a very cool guy.

493
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,720
You're very good looking too.

494
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,070
Tell me if you ever need anything.

495
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,680
Okay.

496
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,670
All right, rest up.

497
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,800
He's been in a mental stupor
for 14 days since surgery.

498
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,050
Motor function is normal.

499
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:11,870
- Have you followed up with a CT?
- Yes, nothing's wrong.

500
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,010
He's older, so he doesn't have
as much energy.

501
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,530
Check on his nutrition and
change his position often.

502
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,660
Yes, I will.

503
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,390
Don't worry. He will wake up soon.

504
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,700
Thank you, Doctor.

505
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:46,724

506
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,730
Why did you ask to see me?

507
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,760
What did I do so wrong?

508
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,070
You're the one who left.

509
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,350
Before you left, you tore up my heart.

510
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,740
I haven't had one night of good sleep
since the day you left.

511
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,940
Is she eating properly...

512
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,380
I won't be able to hold in my anger
if you keep this up.

513
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,400
What did I do?

514
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,700
What did I do to you?

515
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,930
Is it so wrong to try and
get closer to you?

516
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,120
Why are you suddenly trying
to be close to me?

517
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,080
We suddenly met up, didn't we?

518
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,670
You're my daughter.

519
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:31,050
A child may forget her parents...
but a parent never forgets a child.

520
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,550
A relationship between parents
and children is like any other.

521
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,680
We have never been close,
so how can we be now?

522
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,200
"Let's be close now."
You say that and now we are?

523
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,710
We've never spent time together.

524
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,330
We have no shared feelings or emotions.

525
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,820
<i>[KANG KYUNG JOON]</i>

526
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,470
Yes, Kyung Joon.

527
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,960
I should try to look stylish tonight.

528
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,120
Joong Dae, why are you taking that?

529
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,500
For these welcome parties,
they're going to make you drink a lot.

530
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,030
If you pass out and faint,
you will need this.

531
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,630
No, I don't need that stuff.

532
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,720
- I have a high tolerance.
- Oh, really?

533
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,410
I am no longer alienated.

534
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,000
I will finally get to lead a surgery.

535
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,200
Young Gook, have you been
dropped from residency before?

536
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,030
I can see why Chief Kyung Joon
always wants to hit you.

537
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,380
Ah, is that an old wound for you?

538
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,760
Yes, it is a wound and
you poured salt all over it.

539
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,390
- What is it?
- Oh, hi.

540
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,780
It's about Kim Jin Han with glioblastoma.

541
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,200
The 27-year-old grad student who
came into the ER with head pain.

542
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,860
She's Doctor Jung Yoon Do's patient.
She's getting surgery tomorrow afternoon.

543
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,590
You're amazing.

544
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,970
You know about all the patients
that are admitted?

545
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,940
Stop going overboard and sucking up.

546
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,980
Doctor Jung Yoon Do told me to
tell you to get ready for surgery.

547
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,440
Where is Doctor Jung?

548
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:12,890
Why would I attend the board meeting?

549
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,470
Secretary Kim,
I know my father ordered you to do this.

550
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,570
Don't do it.

551
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,270
I have no interest in
any sort of management.

552
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,660
When did you get here?

553
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,240
About Kim Jin Han's surgery...

554
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,610
With a glioblastoma surgery

555
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,420
fast judgment is
more important than technique.

556
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,510
You know that, right?

557
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:38,910
Why don't you do it with
Doctor Jin Seo Woo?

558
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,560
- Why?
- That's how it's always been.

559
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,240
If that's how it's always been,
do I have to keep doing it?

560
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:47,280
Do I only have to be close to
and date people I always have?

561
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,030
You're making a leap there.

562
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,620
We made a decision at that meeting.

563
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,360
The fellows will do surgeries according
to where the staff surgeons see fit.

564
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm following that decision and
telling you to do the surgery.

565
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,230
You're telling me to do
what I usually do.

566
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,730
I got annoyed.

567
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,360
It's nice to see you smile.

568
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,690
Did you know your father
gave me stew to thank me?

569
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,200
I didn't know.

570
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,140
You should know that stuff.

571
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,260
It would be nice if you also knew
that it was really good.

572
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,350
You don't like hearing this.

573
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,560
- What?
- I didn't make you smile.

574
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,790
I like that look you have now.

575
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,460
What are you doing? It's so cheesy.

576
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,530
Women like it when guys act like this.

577
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,650
They start to complain that it's cheesy,
but they're eventually won over.

578
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,030
People get addicted to
these cheesy lines.

579
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,500
Oh... Doctor!

580
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,330
I am thinking of you as a woman.

581
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,840
Let's eat that cafeteria food tomorrow.

582
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,750
Let's eat together and then
go into surgery.

583
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,500
Your answer is "Yes."

584
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:17,524

585
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,320
One, two. One, two.

586
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,440
Mic test, mic test.

587
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,620
- Can you all hear me?
- Yes!

588
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,760
Thank you.

589
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,570
Gookil Hospital's
Neurosurgery Department.

590
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:35,860
Now, let's welcome Choi Kang Soo
and Pi Young Gook's first lead surgery!

591
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,740
Yes, thank you.

592
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,000
I am your MC for the night,
Gookil's eternal cutie...

593
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,150
Kang Kyung Joon! Hello, everyone!

594
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,510
Joong Dae, stop eating and clap.

595
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,200
First, Neurosurgery's captain and leader.

596
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,240
Let's hear a toast from
Section Chief Kim Tae Ho.

597
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:11,100
Kim Tae Ho, Kim Tae Ho,
Kim Tae Ho, Kim Tae Ho!

598
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,300
It's best to keep things simple
on days like this.

599
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,400
The Neurosurgery Department
deals with the brain.

600
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,410
The brain controls the human body.

601
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:26,190
Therefore, the Neurosurgery Department
controls everything!

602
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,290
- Welcome!
- Grandpa.

603
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,150
We live in the same building,
but why is it that I rarely see you?

604
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,730
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

605
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,970
Yes.

606
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:45,370
We kept saying that we would have dinner,
but it took so long to happen.

607
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,830
I'm sorry. I've been negligent.

608
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,090
We ordered already.

609
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,340
I have an appointment and
have to leave in two hours.

610
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,370
I see.

611
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,830
I met your father and
he's hurt that you don't ever call.

612
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:57,830
- You should call him.
- Yes, I will.

613
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,680
Seeing the two of you sitting there,
you two look alike.

614
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,970
You're right.

615
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,530
- Yoon Do?
- Yes, sir.

616
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:08,480
We have so much work to do.

617
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,760
We need the right person.
The hospital will grow many times larger.

618
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,430
Once our health care becomes privatized

619
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,080
and we become a company
in the stock market

620
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,100
it will open up a
whole new world to us doctors.

621
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,340
We have a lot of expectations
for the two of you.

622
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,510
Seo Woo will do a good job.

623
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,640
You will too, Senior.

624
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,430
I won't be involved in management.

625
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,070
If I were interested in that,
I would be working at my dad's company.

626
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,300
I became a doctor to
free myself from that.

627
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,070
Then let your in-laws take over.
Seo Woo will do it.

628
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,520
Excuse me a moment.

629
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,440
Excuse me.

630
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:04,700
Senior... Senior!

631
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,370
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

632
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,180
- I'm leaving.
- What?

633
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,410
It's boring and uncomfortable.

634
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,150
Still, how can you leave in
the middle of a dinner with elders?

635
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,760
You're not that kind of person.

636
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,610
We haven't started eating yet.

637
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,790
- You should speak to them for me.
- Why should I?

638
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,420
It's less embarrassing for you that way.

639
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,440
I'm a bit confused lately.

640
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,260
I'm seeing things about myself
that weren't there before.

641
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,100
Is having dinner with my family
that unpleasant?

642
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,520
Enough so that you would do this to me?

643
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,990
We've known each other for 10 years
and there are no sparks.

644
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,540
- Sparks on one side are still sparks.
- You can't start a fire with that.

645
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,430
I will guarantee you this.

646
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,560
Something bad will
happen to you. I know it.

647
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,740
Bad things happen to anyone
who loves Hye Jung.

648
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,580
That's the jinx she has.

649
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,990
Then... I'll just fall into bad luck.

650
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:35,310
Nice shot! That was great.

651
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,830
One for Chief, one for Professor Hong.

652
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,640
One for the pretty Doctor Yoo.

653
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,200
I'll have two.

654
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,210
Over there.

655
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,950
Oh, Doctor Jung Yoon Do is finally here!

656
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,860
Oh, you can't just sit down
when you just got here.

657
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,960
Since you're late,
you have to drink this.

658
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,290
That punk.

659
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,990
One shot.

660
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:22,720
One more time, one more time,
one more time!

661
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,290
One more time!

662
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:41,100
Also, you cannot forget the last step.

663
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:45,660
Bowing and drinking.
First, Doctor Hong Ji Hong!

664
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,120
What? How do you do it?

665
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,640
I'll do it first.

666
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,760
Please wish me luck!

667
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,300
How can I do that?

668
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,230
Oh my! A man should be able to do it.

669
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,390
Even she can do it.

670
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,750
- She's not a regular girl.
- Doctor!

671
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,670
I'll be his black rose.

672
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,120
Doctor Hong is kind of bad at this stuff.

673
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,790
Give it to me. I can do it.

674
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,800
It doesn't look so hard.
Just put it here like this and do it.

675
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,490
Ouch!

676
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:38,300
Oh no! Look, it's red here. Does it hurt?

677
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,820
- It doesn't hurt.
- It looks like it hurts.

678
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,030
- I'll do it again.
- No, don't do it.

679
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,780
Doctor Hong is bad at this kind of thing.

680
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,220
Doctor Yoo, why don't you
be his black rose?

681
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,010
Doctor, I said I would do it.
Why are you saying that?

682
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,170
It's just your forehead...

683
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,990
Okay, I just have to knock it in.

684
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,750
Wish me luck!

685
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:20,774

686
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,200
Eat.

687
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,670
I'm sorry.

688
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,890
He must think very lowly of you to leave
without even saying goodbye to us.

689
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,920
It's not like that.

690
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,080
Then is it because he looks down on me?

691
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,160
Relationships between men and women
are no different from any other.

692
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,780
The stronger one calls the shots.

693
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,780
You can't take charge
in one relationship.

694
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,910
Can you really handle Gookil Hospital?

695
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:50,490
Why would I trust you
and give you this hospital?

696
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,500
Stop, let her eat.

697
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,260
Dad!

698
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,120
<i>This is what we're up to.
When are you coming?</i>

699
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,390
Jung Yoon Do, that bastard.

700
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,120
This is not too bad.

701
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,260
You awful people.

702
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:16,580
Give it to me.

703
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,460
You want me to do it too? It's okay.

704
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,720
Just give it to me now.

705
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:32,060
- This is nothing for me.
- Okay!

706
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,850
First year resident Choi Kang Soo.
I will work very hard!

707
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,950
One shot, one shot, one shot!

708
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,820
- Hey, Kang Soo.
- Choi Kang Soo!

709
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,500
Hey, Choi Kang Soo!

710
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,640
Wake up, Choi Kang Soo. Choi Kang Soo!

711
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,320
He's not breathing.

712
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,740
- Intubate him.
- Here?

713
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,060
- We don't have the instruments.
- Oh, you can't do it without them.

714
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,110
Senior.

715
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,280
Shall we intubate him?

716
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,750
Joong Dae, you really are so giving!

717
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,610
What did you want to talk about?

718
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,480
You were my black rose,
so I should do something for you too.

719
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,160
- What could it be?
- What could it be?

720
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,850
There was a place like this?

721
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,050
There was.

722
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,360
- Have you tried shooting?
- No.

723
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,780
Watch me do it. You hold it like this.

724
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,220
It's not working very well.
It must be the gun.

725
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,400
You give it a try.
I think something's wrong with the gun.

726
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,080
Wow! You really are something.

727
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,210
What, Doctor...

728
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,390
<i>Two points! Two points!</i>

729
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:52,230
<i>Three points! Three points!</i>

730
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,390
<i>Two points!</i>

731
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,670
<i>[YOO HYE JUNG 735]</i>
735!

732
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,100
Write mine down too.

733
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,610
<i>[HONG JI HONG 386]</i>
386 points.

734
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,140
Let's play another game!

735
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,180
Can you get it?

736
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,240
Got it.

737
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,170
Here.

738
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,350
Thank you.

739
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,800
Should I get another one for you?

740
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,150
This is so fun. I feel like a kid again.

741
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,320
- You like competing, don't you?
- Yes.

742
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,890
We're doing everything you like today.

743
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,450
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

744
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,920
So, the person who makes it to
the goal post first wins.

745
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,970
One... two, three!

746
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:23,310
I won!

747
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,380
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

748
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:29,360
Should we do it one more time?

749
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,090
Okay.

750
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,220
I'll lose for you this time.

751
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,060
<i>It was the first time a woman
grabbed on to my hand first.</i>

752
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:35,300
