00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,213
<font color="yellow">but at home, you're my husband.</font>

158
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:30,543
<font color="yellow">Talk respectfully, will you?</font>

159
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,173
<font color="yellow">You're a wife to a man like me.</font>

160
00:11:33,173 --> 00:11:34,673
<font color="yellow">Have dignity that befits such privilege.</font>

161
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,143
<font color="yellow">Gosh, since when were you so high and mighty?</font>

162
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:39,773
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious.</font>

163
00:11:40,543 --> 00:11:41,543
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

164
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:42,843
<font color="yellow">Get married quickly.</font>

165
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:45,013
<font color="yellow">I'm going to divorce your dad as soon as you get married.</font>

166
00:11:45,473 --> 00:11:48,243
<font color="yellow">Just get divorced now if you'd like. Don't use me as an excuse.</font>

167
00:11:48,813 --> 00:11:50,943
<font color="yellow">Even my one and only daughter gets on my nerve more and more.</font>

168
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,243
<font color="yellow">You're becoming more like your dad.</font>

169
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,943
<font color="yellow">You're never affectionate towards me.</font>

170
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:56,343
<font color="yellow">Stop whining like a baby.</font>

171
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,213
<font color="yellow">Dad and I are stressed from work.</font>

172
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:01,713
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to understand everything alone?</font>

173
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:03,513
<font color="yellow">Yes. That'd be great.</font>

174
00:12:04,273 --> 00:12:05,943
<font color="yellow">You and Dad aren't a good match.</font>

175
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:08,943
<font color="yellow">You'll never get divorced though. Just enjoy spending his money.</font>

176
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,613
<font color="yellow">If only you weren't my daughter...</font>

177
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:12,673
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

178
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,873
<font color="yellow">Are you mad? Mum, wait.</font>

179
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,843
<font color="yellow">Bring Yoon Do home. Let's decide the specifics about your wedding.</font>

180
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:21,943
<font color="yellow">Wedding? We aren't even going out yet.</font>

181
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,873
<font color="yellow">You act like you're the smartest person in the world.</font>

182
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,843
<font color="yellow">Why can't you win his heart?</font>

183
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:29,013
<font color="yellow">I don't like easy guys. A bit of chasing makes them more special.</font>

184
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,943
<font color="yellow">Women are at their happiest when they marry men who like them.</font>

185
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:34,613
<font color="yellow">So are you happy?</font>

186
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:37,673
<font color="yellow">You said you married Dad because he chased you so desperately.</font>

187
00:12:39,943 --> 00:12:41,013
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

188
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,313
<font color="yellow">I married him because he chased me like there's no tomorrow,</font>

189
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,673
<font color="yellow">but now he thinks he's too good for me.</font>

190
00:12:45,313 --> 00:12:47,773
<font color="yellow">They say that animals who think and speak will return evil for good.</font>

191
00:12:48,713 --> 00:12:49,743
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me an animal?</font>

192
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,013
<font color="yellow">This is precisely why I don't like talking to your mum.</font>

193
00:12:54,113 --> 00:12:56,543
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that.</font>

194
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,813
<font color="yellow">Continue your conversation. You'll decide on the wedding date?</font>

195
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,743
<font color="yellow">She's not there yet.</font>

196
00:13:02,243 --> 00:13:03,243
<font color="yellow">Set a date.</font>

197
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:06,413
<font color="yellow">I'll never get locked into a marriage without love.</font>

198
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,013
<font color="yellow">You do love him.</font>

199
00:13:08,673 --> 00:13:11,813
<font color="yellow">How many times do I have to tell you? Yoon Do doesn't love me.</font>

200
00:13:12,143 --> 00:13:14,243
<font color="yellow">We can't leave this in her hands. Please take care of this, Ji Young.</font>

201
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:16,713
<font color="yellow">Dad, please.</font>

202
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,043
<font color="yellow">Love? It's not that important in life.</font>

203
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,773
<font color="yellow">Why would you let such ephemeral feelings decide your life?</font>

204
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:24,573
<font color="yellow">Men aren't anything special either. Yoon Do?</font>

205
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,073
<font color="yellow">If you want him, do whatever it takes to make him yours.</font>

206
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,843
<font color="yellow">You'll get sick of him once he becomes yours. That's love.</font>

207
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:31,373
<font color="yellow">Something you want to discard once it's in your hands.</font>

208
00:13:31,873 --> 00:13:34,243
<font color="yellow">What a great lesson.</font>

209
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,443
<font color="yellow">She can have a loving marriage and become a great mum too.</font>

210
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:39,943
<font color="yellow">Marriage can give women so much happiness.</font>

211
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,413
<font color="yellow">Women like your mum is suited for that kind of joy.</font>

212
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,473
<font color="yellow">You should see a bigger picture.</font>

213
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:45,943
<font color="yellow">Don't forget what I told you previously.</font>

214
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,273
<font color="yellow">Hey, can I move into your place tomorrow?</font>

215
00:14:02,743 --> 00:14:05,343
<font color="yellow">Two men over 30 living together is just wrong.</font>

216
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,913
<font color="yellow">Yoon Do!</font>

217
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:12,743
<font color="yellow">Hi, Uncle.</font>

218
00:14:14,943 --> 00:14:17,943
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter with him? - Is he really your nephew?</font>

219
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,443
<font color="yellow">Is there such thing as a fake nephew?</font>

220
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,673
<font color="yellow">He might be upset because I spent time with you instead.</font>

221
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,413
<font color="yellow">He's a bit simple-minded.</font>

222
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,543
<font color="yellow">He's being rude, not simple-minded.</font>

223
00:14:27,943 --> 00:14:29,413
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to say it like that.</font>

224
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,943
<font color="yellow">Yoon Do! Do you love me that much?</font>

225
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,443
<font color="yellow">Gosh, get off of me! This smell! How much did you drink?</font>

226
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,543
<font color="yellow">You still reek of alcohol.</font>

227
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:43,213
<font color="yellow">- Look at you nagging me. - What is wrong with you?</font>

228
00:14:43,913 --> 00:14:44,943
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong!</font>

229
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:46,643
<font color="yellow">Let's get a ride from him.</font>

230
00:14:47,113 --> 00:14:49,613
<font color="yellow">Why would you tag along? Where's your car?</font>

231
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:52,273
<font color="yellow">I don't have mine. I drank until I dropped last night.</font>

232
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,313
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to. I don't like him.</font>

233
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:58,943
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong, he just told me that he doesn't like you.</font>

234
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:00,643
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously!</font>

235
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:02,273
<font color="yellow">Let's take a taxi if you feel the same way.</font>

236
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:04,443
<font color="yellow">Why should we take a cab when there's a car right here?</font>

237
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:05,513
<font color="yellow">It kills the environment.</font>

238
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,473
<font color="yellow">Why? Don't you have your own car?</font>

239
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:09,613
<font color="yellow">I need to go pick up my car when it arrives from the US.</font>

240
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:14,373
<font color="yellow">Since when did we become so familiar?</font>

241
00:15:14,573 --> 00:15:15,673
<font color="yellow">Aren't you his nephew?</font>

242
00:15:16,113 --> 00:15:17,373
<font color="yellow">I'm his friend!</font>

243
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:20,843
<font color="yellow">If you're his nephew, that means you're my nephew as well.</font>

244
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:21,943
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right, mate?</font>

245
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:23,943
<font color="yellow">Of course. You're not wrong. Let's go.</font>

246
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:25,373
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

247
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,943
<font color="yellow">Uncle. Prof. Hong!</font>

248
00:15:32,313 --> 00:15:34,073
<font color="yellow">My uncle? That's so old-fashioned.</font>

249
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:38,373
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

250
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,573
<font color="yellow">How much did he drink?</font>

251
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,773
<font color="yellow">Why is my uncle so hungover when you're completely fine?</font>

252
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:46,273
<font color="yellow">Are you complaining or what?</font>

253
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,143
<font color="yellow">Your logic makes no sense.</font>

254
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:50,173
<font color="yellow">You're his friend, but that doesn't make me your nephew.</font>

255
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:52,643
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

256
00:15:53,313 --> 00:15:55,873
<font color="yellow">Right? Then let's go back to before...</font>

257
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:57,243
<font color="yellow">I found out that you two are friends.</font>

258
00:16:01,073 --> 00:16:03,743
<font color="yellow">I should get some sleep. Drive carefully.</font>

259
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:08,443
<font color="yellow">And I was too harsh on you yesterday.</font>

260
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:11,813
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what does that make me then?</font>

261
00:16:12,213 --> 00:16:13,643
<font color="yellow">It makes you a narrow-minded fool.</font>

262
00:16:16,613 --> 00:16:17,643
<font color="yellow">Please, Prof. Hong.</font>

263
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:23,273
<font color="yellow">How's the patient's oedema?</font>

264
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:27,043
<font color="yellow">It looks a bit smaller on the CT scan, but it's still quite swollen.</font>

265
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:29,543
<font color="yellow">We're giving the patient 100cc of mannitol divided into 6 doses.</font>

266
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,743
<font color="yellow">- What about pain management? - We're using acetaminophen.</font>

267
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:34,743
<font color="yellow">If the pain seems to be intolerable, use NSAID or ample morphine.</font>

268
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:36,173
<font color="yellow">Notify me when the cerebral oedema goes down a bit.</font>

269
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,113
<font color="yellow">It looks like you can reduce the amount of mannitol as well.</font>

270
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:40,213
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Doctor. - Where's the guardian?</font>

271
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,073
<font color="yellow">I think they stepped out.</font>

272
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:44,913
<font color="yellow">The patient is in mental stupor. Make sure they don't worry too much.</font>

273
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:47,073
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Dr Kim. - Good.</font>

274
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,843
<font color="yellow">(Neurosurgery, Hong Ji Hong)</font>

275
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,913
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong will get here after his rounds.</font>

276
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:09,573
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

277
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,073
<font color="yellow">Well, I just happened to know.</font>

278
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:14,813
<font color="yellow">Are you waiting for him without telling him?</font>

279
00:17:15,513 --> 00:17:17,913
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - You're just waiting for him.</font>

280
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,713
<font color="yellow">- Where did you get that plant? - A flower shop downstairs.</font>

281
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,943
<font color="yellow">I see. I didn't know that there's a flower shop downstairs.</font>

282
00:17:28,343 --> 00:17:31,143
<font color="yellow">By the way, aren't you curious about me at all?</font>

283
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:32,883
<font color="yellow">Do I have to be curious?</font>

284
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:36,173
<font color="yellow">Well, that's how people converse. If I ask you questions,</font>

285
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,243
<font color="yellow">you should reciprocate out of courtesy.</font>

286
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:41,943
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

287
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:45,943
<font color="yellow">You're right. I don't know why.</font>

288
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:05,113
<font color="yellow">The patient has oedema in the head. We left the head exposed...</font>

289
00:18:05,313 --> 00:18:06,613
<font color="yellow">because we have to do decompression.</font>

290
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:10,383
<font color="yellow">The car accident affected the brain's midline as well.</font>

291
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:14,273
<font color="yellow">She may not be able to live like before even if she wakes up.</font>

292
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:15,913
<font color="yellow">What is oedema?</font>

293
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,213
<font color="yellow">Oh, oedema is...</font>

294
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:22,213
<font color="yellow">- It means swelling. - So her brain has swelled up?</font>

295
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,213
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's correct.</font>

296
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:26,573
<font color="yellow">You're saying that we should wait and see how she recovers, right?</font>

297
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:28,673
<font color="yellow">- Yes, that's right. - Okay.</font>

298
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,883
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Doctor. - My pleasure.</font>

299
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,213
<font color="yellow">- All residents to the meeting room. - Yes, Dr Kim.</font>

300
00:18:38,143 --> 00:18:40,383
<font color="yellow">Did something happen? Why does Dr Kim want to meet with all of us?</font>

301
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:43,673
<font color="yellow">My gut feeling tells me that he's furious right now.</font>

302
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:45,313
<font color="yellow">Would it be because of Boss' injury?</font>

303
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:47,473
<font color="yellow">It's almost as if blood finds Dr Yoo wherever she goes.</font>

304
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:50,543
<font color="yellow">I follow her around too because I'm a dutiful resident.</font>

305
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:51,883
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

306
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:58,643
<font color="yellow">Is everyone here?</font>

307
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:00,743
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

308
00:19:01,383 --> 00:19:03,273
<font color="yellow">- Kyung Joon. - Yes?</font>

309
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,713
<font color="yellow">Repeat what you said to the patient Lee Soo Jin's guardian.</font>

310
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,343
<font color="yellow">Sure. The patient has oedema in the head.</font>

311
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:12,883
<font color="yellow">We have to do decompression,</font>

312
00:19:13,773 --> 00:19:15,773
<font color="yellow">- so we left her head exposed. - Enough.</font>

313
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,613
<font color="yellow">What's problematic about what he said, Yeong Gook?</font>

314
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,943
<font color="yellow">I know what the problem is, but I cannot say it.</font>

315
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,573
<font color="yellow">Unbelievable.</font>

316
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:24,773
<font color="yellow">Are you guys trying to defend each other...</font>

317
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:26,013
<font color="yellow">and forming cliques here now?</font>

318
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:29,843
<font color="yellow">How many times did I tell you guys to explain medical terms...</font>

319
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:30,883
<font color="yellow">in Korean when you speak to patients?</font>

320
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:33,883
<font color="yellow">As long as I'm the head of Neurosurgery here,</font>

321
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:35,613
<font color="yellow">that is the rule. That's how I taught you all!</font>

322
00:19:36,213 --> 00:19:38,313
<font color="yellow">How dare you proudly say those terms right in front of my eyes?</font>

323
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:40,443
<font color="yellow">Being able talk in medical jargons...</font>

324
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,673
<font color="yellow">doesn't give you any privilege over patients or their guardians.</font>

325
00:19:43,143 --> 00:19:44,143
<font color="yellow">I apologise.</font>

326
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:47,813
<font color="yellow">All of you are residents.</font>

327
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,243
<font color="yellow">In other words, you're doctors who are still on training.</font>

328
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:53,113
<font color="yellow">You must learn the right attitude along with the right knowledge.</font>

329
00:19:53,543 --> 00:19:54,613
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Dr Kim! - Yes, Dr Kim!</font>

330
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:00,273
<font color="yellow">- When did you get here? - A little while ago.</font>

331
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,243
<font color="yellow">Had you messaged me, I would've rushed here.</font>

332
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:05,543
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

333
00:20:06,643 --> 00:20:07,673
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

334
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:11,173
<font color="yellow">I haven't organized it, so there isn't even anywhere to sit.</font>

335
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:14,013
<font color="yellow">Sorry, my term hasn't begun officially.</font>

336
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:18,043
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on joining Gukil Medical Center.</font>

337
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:22,573
<font color="yellow">Thanks. I didn't know you could do these things.</font>

338
00:20:22,913 --> 00:20:24,013
<font color="yellow">What does this flower mean?</font>

339
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:25,673
<font color="yellow">Does it symbolize pure love by any chance?</font>

340
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:28,383
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I just bought it for no reason because it's pretty.</font>

341
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:30,273
<font color="yellow">No reason.</font>

342
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,343
<font color="yellow">That's my phrase, but it looks like you use it more often now.</font>

343
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:36,473
<font color="yellow">I'm bribing you.</font>

344
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,843
<font color="yellow">You have to help me.</font>

345
00:20:43,513 --> 00:20:44,573
<font color="yellow">What are these numbers?</font>

346
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:48,073
<font color="yellow">It's my grandma's patient number, but I can't access her records...</font>

347
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,113
<font color="yellow">because I'm not a permanent employee.</font>

348
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:51,383
<font color="yellow">You're a staff member, so you should have the access.</font>

349
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,573
<font color="yellow">Show me the power of a permanent employee.</font>

350
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:55,813
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to see her records?</font>

351
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:57,943
<font color="yellow">Please find her file and print all of her records for me.</font>

352
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:01,113
<font color="yellow">Please also let me know which residents were in her surgery.</font>

353
00:21:02,313 --> 00:21:05,173
<font color="yellow">Is this why you refused the position at Daejeon Hospital and came here?</font>

354
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:08,913
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be able to view all the records as an employee here.</font>

355
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:11,273
<font color="yellow">I must say that the president is quite remarkable.</font>

356
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:14,413
<font color="yellow">This hospital has a great information security system.</font>

357
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:26,173
<font color="yellow">Forget it all now, Hye Jung.</font>

358
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:29,843
<font color="yellow">How can I forget?</font>

359
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,943
<font color="yellow">Let's be objective. You're a surgeon too.</font>

360
00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:34,383
<font color="yellow">None of us are free from medical accidents.</font>

361
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:37,473
<font color="yellow">I thought I would understand him if I became a doctor.</font>

362
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,473
<font color="yellow">But now that I'm a doctor, I don't understand him even more.</font>

363
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:43,843
<font color="yellow">"We did everything possible." "There are limitations."</font>

364
00:21:43,943 --> 00:21:46,213
<font color="yellow">"We paid, so don't cause any more trouble."</font>

365
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:50,013
<font color="yellow">Is that the right attitude to deal with a person's death?</font>

366
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:52,743
<font color="yellow">My grandmother...</font>

367
00:21:54,543 --> 00:21:58,443
<font color="yellow">trusted the doctor until the moment she went inside the OR.</font>

368
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,673
<font color="yellow">I need to know everything that happened in that OR.</font>

369
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:10,113
<font color="yellow">Once you find out, what will you do then?</font>

370
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,873
<font color="yellow">I will decide once I find out.</font>

371
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,873
<font color="yellow">The statute of limitations for medical accidents is 10 years.</font>

372
00:22:17,943 --> 00:22:19,313
<font color="yellow">You said accidents can't be restored and amended,</font>

373
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:20,873
<font color="yellow">but the heart can.</font>

374
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:24,443
<font color="yellow">How could you tear that note?</font>

375
00:22:27,443 --> 00:22:29,243
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that.</font>

376
00:22:29,543 --> 00:22:32,013
<font color="yellow">I just felt bad for you.</font>

377
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:34,743
<font color="yellow">You've become a doctor now,</font>

378
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,843
<font color="yellow">and people respect you.</font>

379
00:22:37,073 --> 00:22:40,113
<font color="yellow">Can't you just enjoy your life like everyone else now?</font>

380
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:43,373
<font color="yellow">I had never had the privilege to be normal.</font>

381
00:22:45,213 --> 00:22:46,213
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

382
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:49,613
<font color="yellow">If you won't do it, I will find someone else.</font>

383
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:52,073
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll just hack in.</font>

384
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:25,543
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

385
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:30,943
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my awareness is a bit slow,</font>

386
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:33,073
<font color="yellow">but you're worse.</font>

387
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,543
<font color="yellow">It's normal to turn a blind eye when you see a sight like me.</font>

388
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:38,573
<font color="yellow">At least you are not crying.</font>

389
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:40,173
<font color="yellow">Why did it seem like you were crying?</font>

390
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,113
<font color="yellow">The police is asking us to come and testify.</font>

391
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:46,643
<font color="yellow">They want both of us.</font>

392
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,073
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong already did it.</font>

393
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:54,243
<font color="yellow">He's speedy with everything.</font>

394
00:23:56,743 --> 00:23:57,743
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

395
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:13,013
<font color="yellow">(Search Patient)</font>

396
00:24:13,113 --> 00:24:14,173
<font color="yellow">(Access Denied)</font>

397
00:24:16,943 --> 00:24:19,143

398
00:24:19,243 --> 00:24:22,543
<font color="yellow">(You do not have the credentials to access the patient's information.)</font>

399
00:24:27,913 --> 00:24:29,673
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung caused more trouble, didn't she?</font>

400
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:32,743
<font color="yellow">She didn't cause trouble. She's in trouble.</font>

401
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:35,943
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for Hye Jung, he would've been long dead.</font>

402
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:48,573
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here together? - We got investigated together.</font>

403
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:51,373
<font color="yellow">It must me upsetting to get caught up in such a mess.</font>

404
00:24:52,713 --> 00:24:55,273
<font color="yellow">Something bad always happens when you're beside her.</font>

405
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,443
<font color="yellow">I hope she gets kicked out like you wanted.</font>

406
00:24:57,713 --> 00:24:59,073
<font color="yellow">I no longer wish that.</font>

407
00:25:00,143 --> 00:25:01,643
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo is a good person.</font>

408
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:02,743
<font color="yellow">She turned out to be a decent person.</font>

409
00:25:03,913 --> 00:25:05,443
<font color="yellow">What made you change your mind?</font>

410
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,773
<font color="yellow">If you want specific details, I don't have any for you.</font>

411
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:11,673
<font color="yellow">What is this strange feeling?</font>

412
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:13,743
<font color="yellow">Did you fall for her?</font>

413
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:16,143
<font color="yellow">Why are you...</font>

414
00:25:16,643 --> 00:25:17,643
<font color="yellow">so hostile towards Dr Yoo?</font>

415
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:19,373
<font color="yellow">I told you. I'm traumatized.</font>

416
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:21,343
<font color="yellow">It's all her fault.</font>

417
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,113
<font color="yellow">She was a gangster in high school.</font>

418
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:25,543
<font color="yellow">She couldn't graduate since she was expelled.</font>

419
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:28,913
<font color="yellow">I kept the details from you...</font>

420
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:30,473
<font color="yellow">because I respected her.</font>

421
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,113
<font color="yellow">That was unnecessary.</font>

422
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:34,643
<font color="yellow">I personally heard from Dr Yoo.</font>

423
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:37,243
<font color="yellow">This is where I get curious.</font>

424
00:25:37,673 --> 00:25:41,413
<font color="yellow">Did you really let Dr Yoo bully you?</font>

425
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:44,913
<font color="yellow">I bet my car that you didn't.</font>

426
00:25:49,273 --> 00:25:51,743
<font color="yellow">I think something happened in Boss' room.</font>

427
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,113
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he got blindsided.</font>

428
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:56,313
<font color="yellow">There are many rumors, but when they're pieced together,</font>

429
00:25:56,743 --> 00:25:59,243
<font color="yellow">we can infer that Dr Yoo saved Dr Jung...</font>

430
00:25:59,673 --> 00:26:00,913
<font color="yellow">from getting beaten up to death.</font>

431
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,073
<font color="yellow">Which animal do you like?</font>

432
00:26:08,473 --> 00:26:09,543
<font color="yellow">Dog.</font>

433
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:11,943
<font color="yellow">I love them because they don't betray you.</font>

434
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,243
<font color="yellow">Move her to the ward.</font>

435
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,713
<font color="yellow">Okay, Doctor.</font>

436
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:19,643
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

437
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,013
<font color="yellow">The pretty doctor is here.</font>

438
00:26:22,643 --> 00:26:23,643
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

439
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,943
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

440
00:26:25,773 --> 00:26:26,843
<font color="yellow">You keep coming back.</font>

441
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:30,013
<font color="yellow">As someone who was there when it happened, I feel responsible.</font>

442
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:34,073
<font color="yellow">You came because you have something to tell my doctor.</font>

443
00:26:34,173 --> 00:26:35,273
<font color="yellow">I'm just an excuse.</font>

444
00:26:35,813 --> 00:26:37,743
<font color="yellow">Nobody can fool you!</font>

445
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:40,043
<font color="yellow">Your car is mine now.</font>

446
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,473
<font color="yellow">What? - How on earth do you think of me?</font>

447
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:47,343
<font color="yellow">What makes you think that I didn't just get bullied?</font>

448
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,843
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk somewhere else. - Let's talk here. Don't mind her.</font>

449
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:52,873
<font color="yellow">She has already seen me making a fuss.</font>

450
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:54,073
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

451
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,013
<font color="yellow">Do you not understand what you've done wrong?</font>

452
00:26:57,613 --> 00:26:59,213
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. All right?</font>

453
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,243
<font color="yellow">Can you just omit the "All right?"</font>

454
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:02,343
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

455
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:04,473
<font color="yellow">It's not an apology otherwise.</font>

456
00:27:06,013 --> 00:27:09,243
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you two are like best friends.</font>

457
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:11,043
<font color="yellow">I'll take that part back.</font>

458
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:13,373
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

459
00:27:13,643 --> 00:27:16,173
<font color="yellow">You're not superior because I like you.</font>

460
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:17,373
<font color="yellow">I have the upper hand.</font>

461
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:19,243
<font color="yellow">I like you, Doctor.</font>

462
00:27:19,573 --> 00:27:21,513
<font color="yellow">I should've lived like you from the start.</font>

463
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,273
<font color="yellow">You're just as hot-tempered as I am.</font>

464
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:27,343
<font color="yellow">Will you do me a favour?</font>

465
00:27:28,343 --> 00:27:29,673
<font color="yellow">Please tell my son...</font>

466
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:31,243
<font color="yellow">to bring the witch here.</font>

467
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:33,373
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't listen to me.</font>

468
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:37,743
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

469
00:27:38,313 --> 00:27:40,313
<font color="yellow">Why are you so busy?</font>

470
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:41,943
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

471
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:44,273
<font color="yellow">Isn't he still on vacation?</font>

472
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:46,743
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving my son a hard time?</font>

473
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,073
<font color="yellow">I wasn't, Sir.</font>

474
00:27:48,273 --> 00:27:51,013
<font color="yellow">I told him not to come, but he keeps insisting.</font>

475
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,513
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's not true, Doctor.</font>

476
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:56,013
<font color="yellow">Okay. Okay. Rest until the end of this week.</font>

477
00:27:56,313 --> 00:27:57,313
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

478
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,843
<font color="yellow">Let's go fishing.</font>

479
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,573
<font color="yellow">I really dislike fishing though.</font>

480
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,913
<font color="yellow">It gets fun once you're there.</font>

481
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,313
<font color="yellow">But you've been fishing for more than 10 years.</font>

482
00:28:05,413 --> 00:28:07,273
<font color="yellow">I should've liked it by now.</font>

483
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:09,473
<font color="yellow">I assure you. Within a year,</font>

484
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,143
<font color="yellow">you will learn to like it.</font>

485
00:28:11,743 --> 00:28:13,273
<font color="yellow">I really don't like fishing.</font>

486
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:18,913
<font color="yellow">Hello, here's an invite.</font>

487
00:28:19,013 --> 00:28:21,043
<font color="yellow">We opened a new cafe. Please visit.</font>

488
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,013
<font color="yellow">Hello. I just opened...</font>

489
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:25,613
<font color="yellow">a new cafe. Please visit.</font>

490
00:28:25,943 --> 00:28:27,513
<font color="yellow">It's a Gukil Medical Center 20 percent discount.</font>

491
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:28,713
<font color="yellow">Anyway...</font>

492
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,913
<font color="yellow">Watch where you're going!</font>

493
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:33,343
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>

494
00:28:35,043 --> 00:28:36,773
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

495
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:39,213
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

496
00:28:39,313 --> 00:28:40,473
<font color="yellow">Mum, let's hurry on up.</font>

497
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:42,843
<font color="yellow">If we turn this in earlier, we might see a doctor faster.</font>

498
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,173
<font color="yellow">- Oh... - Don't.</font>

499
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:49,773
<font color="yellow">If your grades were just a little better, you could've been a doctor.</font>

500
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:53,073
<font color="yellow">Mum, isn't it too late to say that now?</font>

501
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,673
<font color="yellow">I am already on my third year.</font>

502
00:28:54,873 --> 00:28:56,613
<font color="yellow">I just feel bad. That's all.</font>

503
00:28:56,913 --> 00:28:58,573
<font color="yellow">You can't compare grade requirement standards...</font>

504
00:28:58,673 --> 00:29:00,073
<font color="yellow">between medical school and education school.</font>

505
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:01,943
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Please stop the delusion.</font>

506
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:03,473
<font color="yellow">My grades weren't good enough for medical school.</font>

507
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:07,173
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you are too humble, Darling.</font>

508
00:29:08,143 --> 00:29:09,943
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

509
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,113
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung!</font>

510
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:16,713
<font color="yellow">My proud doctor friend!

511
00:29:17,543 --> 00:29:18,543
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hye Jung!</font>

512
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:20,173
<font color="yellow">- Lower your voice! - Hye Jung!</font>

513
00:29:21,673 --> 00:29:23,343
<font color="yellow">Where is she? Where did she go?</font>

514
00:29:23,443 --> 00:29:24,443
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

515
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,043
<font color="yellow">Gosh, there is this lady...</font>

516
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:28,573
<font color="yellow">who always brags about her daughter becoming a teacher.</font>

517
00:29:29,113 --> 00:29:30,673
<font color="yellow">My friend is a doctor!</font>

518
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:33,273
<font color="yellow">I would slap her if she wasn't ill.</font>

519
00:29:33,943 --> 00:29:35,413
<font color="yellow">You do your own marketing now.</font>

520
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:38,873
<font color="yellow">Of course. Now I'm all energized.</font>

521
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,613
<font color="yellow">I will be fine.</font>

522
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:42,273
<font color="yellow">Here are your clothes.</font>

523
00:29:43,173 --> 00:29:44,873
<font color="yellow">You didn't have time to stop by at home.</font>

524
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:46,673
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

525
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:48,573
<font color="yellow">Cheers, Dear.</font>

526
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:50,413
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

527
00:29:54,873 --> 00:29:56,243
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

528
00:29:57,473 --> 00:30:00,913
<font color="yellow">I'm from Sooni Hawaii, a new cafe that just opened...</font>

529
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:02,943
<font color="yellow">across the street. I am the owner, Soon Hee.</font>

530
00:30:03,213 --> 00:30:04,273
<font color="yellow">We have an opening promotion.</font>

531
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:07,613
<font color="yellow">I'm offering a 20 percent discount for employees at Gukil Hospital.</font>

532
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,943
<font color="yellow">Please come.</font>

533
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:12,943
<font color="yellow">Please go.</font>

534
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:16,113
<font color="yellow">Pedlars are not allowed in the hospital premise.</font>

535
00:30:16,913 --> 00:30:18,413
<font color="yellow">What are the guards doing?</font>

536
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:21,573
<font color="yellow">I don't think you heard my introduction properly.</font>

537
00:30:21,943 --> 00:30:25,013
<font color="yellow">I'm a CEO. I'm not a peddler.</font>

538
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,113
<font color="yellow">I own a cafe called Sooni Hawaii.</font>

539
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:29,673
<font color="yellow">So get out.</font>

540
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,413
<font color="yellow">Since when were cafe owners referred to as CEOs?</font>

541
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:35,113
<font color="yellow">My friend is a doctor here.</font>

542
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,213
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

543
00:30:36,313 --> 00:30:39,073
<font color="yellow">I'm not someone you can just treat with contempt.</font>

544
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,113
<font color="yellow">My eldest brother is a Seoul District judge.</font>

545
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:46,373
<font color="yellow">My other brother is a CEO of a well-known venture company.</font>

546
00:30:46,573 --> 00:30:49,673
<font color="yellow">My father dedicated his whole life to education.</font>

547
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,243
<font color="yellow">And you're not leaving.</font>

548
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:55,213
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, he has quite a personality.</font>

549
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:56,843
<font color="yellow">Please, come here.</font>

550
00:30:57,043 --> 00:30:58,073
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

551
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:00,243
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

552
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:05,573
<font color="yellow">I am pretty, aren't I?</font>

553
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:09,043
<font color="yellow">How can he treat a pretty girl like me so badly?</font>

554
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:11,243
<font color="yellow">By the way, how old are you?</font>

555
00:31:11,613 --> 00:31:13,643
<font color="yellow">I don't look at girls who are older than 30.</font>

556
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,173
<font color="yellow">I am 26.</font>

557
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:19,573
<font color="yellow">That's perfect. 26 is perfect.</font>

558
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,513
<font color="yellow">So your friend is a resident here?</font>

559
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,573
<font color="yellow">- What? - Which department?</font>

560
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,943
<font color="yellow">Anyway, please visit my cafe, Doctor.</font>

561
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:33,013
<font color="yellow">I have to hand out flyers to the rest of the people here.</font>

562
00:31:33,243 --> 00:31:35,813
<font color="yellow">We're having a company dinner soon. I'll make sure we go there.</font>

563
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:36,943
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

564
00:31:38,843 --> 00:31:42,373
<font color="yellow">Good-looking people tend to have good personalities.</font>

565
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:49,943
<font color="yellow">Look how messed up his face is.</font>

566
00:31:50,943 --> 00:31:52,773
<font color="yellow">Hey. Go get her.</font>

567
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:54,843
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

568
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:00,943
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

569
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,813
<font color="yellow">- Lee Ga Jin. - Yes.</font>

570
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:05,543
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Mum.</font>

571
00:32:11,273 --> 00:32:13,273
<font color="yellow">What brought you to the hospital?</font>

572
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,543
<font color="yellow">As you can see...</font>

573
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,843
<font color="yellow">- Oh. - What is it?</font>

574
00:32:24,213 --> 00:32:26,913
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

575
00:32:27,743 --> 00:32:30,073
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Mum? You're embarrassing me.</font>

576
00:32:30,743 --> 00:32:31,743
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

577
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:34,173
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

578
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:36,943
<font color="yellow">This is your sister Hye Jung.</font>

579
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:39,813
<font color="yellow">Let's do an MRI scan first.</font>

580
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:42,473
<font color="yellow">Go with the nurse. She'll tell you where to go.</font>

581
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:45,273
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Come with me, please.</font>

582
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,413
<font color="yellow">Is that really Hye Jung?</font>

583
00:32:58,073 --> 00:32:59,113
<font color="yellow">Why is she pretending not to know you?</font>

584
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:01,073
<font color="yellow">She was always that rude.</font>

585
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:02,873
<font color="yellow">- Mr Kim Gyeong Ho? - Yes.</font>

586
00:33:06,813 --> 00:33:07,813
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

587
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:09,073
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

588
00:33:09,073 --> 00:33:12,843
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear it? I'm her mum.</font>

589
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,143
<font color="yellow">Wait a second.</font>

590
00:33:14,143 --> 00:33:15,843
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. - You!</font>

591
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,573
<font color="yellow">Are you ignoring your own mum? You're Hye Jung, aren't you?</font>

592
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,713
<font color="yellow">Since when were you my mum?</font>

593
00:33:21,943 --> 00:33:24,943
<font color="yellow">How could you say that in front of all these people?</font>

594
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:28,313
<font color="yellow">Aren't you embarrassed to be a doctor and treat your mum like this?</font>

595
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:32,143
<font color="yellow">I won't admit to anything that isn't true because people are watching.</font>

596
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:34,273
<font color="yellow">There's no way you will be my mum.</font>

597
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:37,673
<font color="yellow">Wake up if you think you can use people against me.</font>

598
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:39,673
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm Hye Jung.</font>

599
00:33:39,943 --> 00:33:44,373
<font color="yellow">I knew it was you. Then I won't let you treat me.</font>

600
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:46,943
<font color="yellow">I want a different doctor.</font>

601
00:34:06,873 --> 00:34:08,213
<font color="yellow">I was very worried.</font>

602
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,783
<font color="yellow">You never get old.</font>

603
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:15,143
<font color="yellow">That isn't true. I'm getting so old that it makes me sad.</font>

604
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:16,473
<font color="yellow">Come closer.</font>

605
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:21,813
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

606
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,473
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. It's okay.</font>

607
00:34:25,843 --> 00:34:27,543
<font color="yellow">That temper is what made her brain burst.</font>

608
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,473
<font color="yellow">Let's leave.</font>

609
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,043
<font color="yellow">I feel so good.</font>

610
00:34:48,283 --> 00:34:50,283
<font color="yellow">I gave him a clean divorce...</font>

611
00:34:50,643 --> 00:34:51,713
<font color="yellow">when he cheated on me because he was low and dirty.</font>

612
00:34:53,243 --> 00:34:55,443
<font color="yellow">I didn't get a penny from that divorce.</font>

613
00:34:56,243 --> 00:34:58,813
<font color="yellow">So I worked hard to raise my children.</font>

614
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:03,143
<font color="yellow">I worked day and night and am finally almost settled.</font>

615
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:06,073
<font color="yellow">What did I do wrong?</font>

616
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,913
<font color="yellow">Things will end well? Nonsense.</font>

617
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:11,943
<font color="yellow">While I'm in a hospital bed,</font>

618
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:15,813
<font color="yellow">her face is glowing from whatever she's taking.</font>

619
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:18,943
<font color="yellow">You have to get plenty of rest.</font>

620
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:20,713
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't divorced my husband,</font>

621
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:23,713
<font color="yellow">she would've been living under my shadow.</font>

622
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,743
<font color="yellow">But she has a good life.</font>

623
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:31,943
<font color="yellow">You can date and have fun when you get better.</font>

624
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:35,143

625
00:35:36,173 --> 00:35:37,373
<font color="yellow">You're still pretty.</font>

626
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,043
<font color="yellow">You must feel bad for me.</font>

627
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:42,283
<font color="yellow">You can't actually mean that.</font>

628
00:35:42,943 --> 00:35:44,013
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

629

<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

678
00:38:52,783 --> 00:38:55,443

689

691
00:39:41,343 --> 00:39:43,643

692

694
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:49,443
<font color="yellow">So what happened?</font>

695
00:39:49,543 --> 00:39:52,343
<font color="yellow">She didn't look broke, and she came with her daughter.</font>

696
00:39:52,573 --> 00:39:54,243
<font color="yellow">Is she your sister?</font>

697
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:58,143
<font color="yellow">We share the same dad, so I guess she's my half-sister.</font>

698
00:39:58,513 --> 00:39:59,513
<font color="yellow">What's the problem?</font>

699
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,943
<font color="yellow">If she doesn't look poor, she can get it treated.</font>

700
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,743
<font color="yellow">I can't treat her.</font>

701
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:07,113
<font color="yellow">Transfer her to a different doctor.</font>

702
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,413
<font color="yellow">The different doctor said he won't do it.</font>

703
00:40:08,913 --> 00:40:11,143
<font color="yellow">He's weird. Why won't he do it?</font>

704
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:13,413
<font color="yellow">The hospital regulations...</font>

705
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,713
<font color="yellow">don't allow patients to switch doctors as they please.</font>

706
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:16,713
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

707
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,213
<font color="yellow">Are you standing up for him because you're both doctors?</font>

708
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,213
<font color="yellow">Aren't there any single men here?</font>

709
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,213
<font color="yellow">I want squid and pork bulgogi.</font>

710
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,443
<font color="yellow">Those two still stick around together.</font>

711
00:40:29,913 --> 00:40:30,943
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

712
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:33,413
<font color="yellow">What is it? Whom did you see?</font>

713
00:40:33,513 --> 00:40:35,743
<font color="yellow">- Stop that. - Who is it?</font>

714
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:37,073
<font color="yellow">I don't want to eat here.</font>

715
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:39,073
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

716
00:40:39,173 --> 00:40:42,143
<font color="yellow">Come on. What's wrong with you?</font>

717
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,643
<font color="yellow">The cafeteria food looked good.</font>

718
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:47,343
<font color="yellow">The girl sitting across Hye Jung used to be my friend.</font>

719
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,813
<font color="yellow">She dumped me after meeting Hye Jung.</font>

720
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,713
<font color="yellow">There shouldn't be ownership between friends.</font>

721
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:54,873
<font color="yellow">That comes from lack of affection.</font>

722
00:40:55,443 --> 00:40:58,373
<font color="yellow">That's why you identify with Ms Oh Yeong Mi.</font>

723
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,873
<font color="yellow">What about her?</font>

724
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:01,943
<font color="yellow">She said, "Bring me that witch" as soon as she woke up.</font>

725
00:41:02,313 --> 00:41:04,543
<font color="yellow">Her husband betrayed her and divorced her.</font>

726
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:07,013
<font color="yellow">Why are you criticizing the victim?</font>

727
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:10,143
<font color="yellow">A strong rapport with a patient is dangerous.</font>

728
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,673
<font color="yellow">You worry too much.</font>

729
00:41:13,213 --> 00:41:16,643
<font color="yellow">I saw Yoon Do talking to Hye Jung in the fellow room.</font>

730
00:41:17,413 --> 00:41:19,543
<font color="yellow">Why did they have to discuss there?</font>

731
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,043
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo's mum came and turned the outpatient clinic upside down.</font>

732
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,173
<font color="yellow">It must have something to do with that.</font>

733
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:27,283
<font color="yellow">- Why? - What kind of mum acts like that?</font>

734
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,573
<font color="yellow">Yelling and causing a commotion at her daughter's work would...</font>

735
00:41:29,573 --> 00:41:31,143
<font color="yellow">would obviously humiliate her daughter so much.</font>

736
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,313
<font color="yellow">She must be her stepmother.</font>

737
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:36,113
<font color="yellow">She lived only with her grandmother in high school.</font>

738
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:39,173
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Don't forget that you already dragged me out.</font>

739
00:41:44,283 --> 00:41:45,283
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo!</font>

740
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,213
<font color="yellow">We want a party to welcome you and to celebrate me becoming...</font>

741
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:50,413
<font color="yellow">a resident as well as Yeong Gook's first surgery.</font>

742
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:53,043
<font color="yellow">We're thinking this Friday. You can make it, right?</font>

743
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:54,743
<font color="yellow">There're so many reasons to party, aren't there?</font>

744
00:41:55,283 --> 00:41:58,213
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I'll be there. - Where are you guys going?</font>

745
00:41:58,313 --> 00:41:59,673
<font color="yellow">There's a place we usually go to.</font>

746
00:42:00,613 --> 00:42:02,043
<font color="yellow">By the way, who are you...</font>

747
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:06,943
<font color="yellow">We opened a month ago. I'm here to promote my cafe.</font>

748
00:42:07,913 --> 00:42:09,373
<font color="yellow">Oh, Sooni Hawaii.</font>

749
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:11,413
<font color="yellow">- You know? - I've been there once.</font>

750
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:15,643
<font color="yellow">I knew it! I thought you looked familiar.</font>

751
00:42:16,043 --> 00:42:17,283
<font color="yellow">You're cute!</font>

752
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:21,413
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of it if it's a welcome party for Hye Jung.</font>

753
00:42:21,543 --> 00:42:23,813
<font color="yellow">That way, she'll be able to win brownie points with her co-workers.</font>

754
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:25,873
<font color="yellow">He's should try to score brownie points with me.</font>

755
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,113
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that right?</font>

756
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:29,873
<font color="yellow">Gosh, then I can't take care of the entire bill.</font>

757
00:42:30,743 --> 00:42:33,313
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a 50 percent discount.</font>

758
00:42:34,473 --> 00:42:37,043
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it. - Yes! Let's do it!</font>

759
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:45,513
<font color="yellow">Get changed. Shall I wait for you outside?</font>

760
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:47,613
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll get changed later.</font>

761
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:55,283
<font color="yellow">Your life is so exhausting.</font>

762
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:58,343
<font color="yellow">One day, it's the gangster boss. Then your stepmother shows up.</font>

763
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,343
<font color="yellow">Why did you get Yoon Do involved in it?</font>

764
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:05,913
<font color="yellow">I do not appreciate how you worded it.</font>

765
00:43:06,943 --> 00:43:09,243
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to make things better here.</font>

766
00:43:09,373 --> 00:43:12,373
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to thank you for trying to make such effort?</font>

767
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,143
<font color="yellow">We work in the same space.</font>

768
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:17,213
<font color="yellow">Being on bad terms like this is uncomfortable,</font>

769
00:43:17,213 --> 00:43:18,843
<font color="yellow">so I'm reaching out to you first.</font>

770
00:43:19,073 --> 00:43:21,873
<font color="yellow">I was going to ask Dr Jung to take care of my female patient.</font>

771
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:24,873
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you so that you don't get a wrong idea.</font>

772
00:43:25,073 --> 00:43:27,783
<font color="yellow">Do you think that I've been misled by wrong ideas all along?</font>

773
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:30,643
<font color="yellow">You said five minutes ago that you're trying to make things better.</font>

774
00:43:41,073 --> 00:43:43,173
<font color="yellow">- Send me the organized charts. - Sure.</font>

775
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,243
<font color="yellow">- Have a great day. - You, too.</font>

776
00:43:44,243 --> 00:43:45,843
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo looks like...</font>

777
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:48,813
<font color="yellow">she grew up in a rich family without having to lift a finger.</font>

778
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:51,943
<font color="yellow">That's why I like her. She always surprises you.</font>

779
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:54,013
<font color="yellow">You have such obscure taste in women.</font>

780
00:43:54,073 --> 00:43:55,613
<font color="yellow">What do you like about that spotted witch?</font>

781
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:56,613
<font color="yellow">Why is she "spotted witch"?</font>

782
00:43:56,613 --> 00:43:58,143
<font color="yellow">She has a mole right here.</font>

783
00:43:58,143 --> 00:43:59,513
<font color="yellow">A witch with a spot.</font>

784
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:02,373
<font color="yellow">How childish. You definitely lack creativity.</font>

785
00:44:04,473 --> 00:44:05,613
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't hit my head.</font>

786
00:44:05,873 --> 00:44:07,313
<font color="yellow">Do you guys have nothing to do or what?</font>

787
00:44:08,343 --> 00:44:09,913
<font color="yellow">No, we were working.</font>

788
00:44:09,943 --> 00:44:12,543
<font color="yellow">Give me the chart for Dr Yoo's patient with facial spasm.</font>

789
00:44:12,543 --> 00:44:13,773
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take that patient?</font>

790
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:15,143
<font color="yellow">That's awesome!</font>

791
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:17,313
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad that you made this decision.</font>

792
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:19,013
<font color="yellow">Why do you say that?</font>

793
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:21,673
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that the patient is Dr Yoo's stepmother?</font>

794
00:44:21,673 --> 00:44:24,143
<font color="yellow">It looks like she has a complicated family problem.</font>

795
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:29,113
<font color="yellow">Cranial nerve 7 and 8...</font>

796
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:30,643
<font color="yellow">which emerges from the brainstem...</font>

797
00:44:30,743 --> 00:44:32,573
<font color="yellow">are located near the cerebral artery.</font>

798
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:35,913
<font color="yellow">Arteries move every time the heart beats due to the pulsation.</font>

799
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:38,413
<font color="yellow">It stimulates cranial nerve seven...</font>

800
00:44:38,473 --> 00:44:40,013
<font color="yellow">and causes facial spasm.</font>

801
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,113
<font color="yellow">She's been going to a doctor in my neighbourhood...</font>

802
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:43,813
<font color="yellow">and has been taking medication.</font>

803
00:44:43,873 --> 00:44:45,343
<font color="yellow">She's also tried getting Botox to alleviate it.</font>

804
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,313
<font color="yellow">I only found out that her brain could be the cause...</font>

805
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:48,843
<font color="yellow">after looking it up online.</font>

806
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:52,273
<font color="yellow">However, the doctor she's been seeing can't help me with it.</font>

807
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:55,743
<font color="yellow">Most patients take about 4 to 5 years to find out what causes it.</font>

808
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:58,113
<font color="yellow">The brain surgery also scares them.</font>

809
00:44:58,473 --> 00:44:59,913
<font color="yellow">Then how could we treat it?</font>

810
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:01,813
<font color="yellow">We could try the microvascular decompression surgery.</font>

811
00:45:06,443 --> 00:45:07,943
<font color="yellow">We'll get into where the nerve is...</font>

812
00:45:08,143 --> 00:45:10,213
<font color="yellow">and separate the facial nerve from the artery.</font>

813
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:11,713
<font color="yellow">Then we'll insert a Teflon sponge...</font>

814
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:13,773
<font color="yellow">between the nerve and the blood vessel...</font>

815
00:45:13,773 --> 00:45:15,673
<font color="yellow">to relieve and prevent the pressure.</font>

816
00:45:17,443 --> 00:45:19,173
<font color="yellow">It has a success rate of 96 percent.</font>

817
00:45:19,713 --> 00:45:20,943
<font color="yellow">When can I get the surgery?</font>

818
00:45:22,143 --> 00:45:23,813
<font color="yellow">Could you go to a different hospital?</font>

819
00:45:24,273 --> 00:45:27,213
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a referral and send your MRI scan to the doctor.</font>

820
00:45:27,413 --> 00:45:28,943
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go to a different hospital.</font>

821
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:31,673
<font color="yellow">We could use your employee discount, right?</font>

822
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:33,843
<font color="yellow">I heard that the discount is 30 percent.</font>

823
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:37,273
<font color="yellow">You've done nothing for our family.</font>

824
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,713
<font color="yellow">It's not like you'll pay my bill.</font>

825
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,613
<font color="yellow">It won't inconvenience you in any way.</font>

826
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:44,773
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I've been through while living with your dad?</font>

827
00:45:45,673 --> 00:45:47,713
<font color="yellow">I ended up with a condition like this because of all the stress.</font>

828
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:51,713
<font color="yellow">I cut all ties with him 13 years ago.</font>

829
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:54,773
<font color="yellow">A parent-and-child relationship doesn't end that easily.</font>

830
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:58,673
<font color="yellow">It'd be so great if you could visit him and apologise to him.</font>

831
00:46:00,513 --> 00:46:01,943
<font color="yellow">I cannot do your surgery.</font>

832
00:46:02,443 --> 00:46:03,443
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

833
00:46:04,073 --> 00:46:05,573
<font color="yellow">Are you scared that you'd end up killing me?</font>

834
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:09,173
<font color="yellow">I'll stay at this hospital regardless of what you say.</font>

835
00:46:09,773 --> 00:46:12,313
<font color="yellow">Knowing someone at a hospital makes a world of difference.</font>

836
00:46:12,943 --> 00:46:14,143
<font color="yellow">Plus, you're a doctor.</font>

837
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:17,643
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to go to a different hospital when you're a doctor here?</font>

838
00:46:19,173 --> 00:46:21,873
<font color="yellow">People obviously don't change.</font>

839
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:24,943
<font color="yellow">What about you then? Do you think you've changed?</font>

840
00:46:25,313 --> 00:46:27,443
<font color="yellow">You're just wrapped around in a fancy shell.</font>

841
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:30,213
<font color="yellow">You come from the same place as us even though you sit there now.</font>

842
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:31,643
<font color="yellow">Mum, stop it.</font>

843
00:46:32,473 --> 00:46:34,573
<font color="yellow">When can I get the surgery? Let's do it as soon as possible.</font>

844
00:46:35,943 --> 00:46:38,113
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say. Please wait outside.</font>

845
00:46:45,443 --> 00:46:46,443
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung!</font>

846
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:55,743
<font color="yellow">This is our restaurant.</font>

847
00:46:57,673 --> 00:47:00,143
<font color="yellow">(Grandma's Diner)</font>

848
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:01,413
<font color="yellow">We're doing okay financially.</font>

849
00:47:01,713 --> 00:47:03,213
<font color="yellow">We won't burden you.</font>

850
00:47:10,573 --> 00:47:12,473
<font color="yellow">(Grandma's Diner)</font>

851
00:47:17,243 --> 00:47:21,643
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed cannot be reached.</font>

852
00:47:21,743 --> 00:47:23,273
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the tone.</font>

853
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:25,043
<font color="yellow">This is Jung Yoon Do.</font>

854
00:47:25,673 --> 00:47:27,773
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of the patient Ms Lee Ga Jin's surgery.</font>

855
00:47:31,143 --> 00:47:32,373
<font color="yellow">Who were you talking to?</font>

856
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:33,643
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

857
00:47:34,673 --> 00:47:35,713
<font color="yellow">When did you get here?</font>

858
00:47:36,043 --> 00:47:38,443
<font color="yellow">A little while ago. I was quiet because you were on the phone.</font>

859
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:41,573
<font color="yellow">The surgery for Dr Yoo's mother.</font>

860
00:47:43,073 --> 00:47:45,073
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do it. She won't be comfortable enough to do it.</font>

861
00:47:45,143 --> 00:47:47,873
<font color="yellow">Since when were you this considerate of others?</font>

862
00:47:49,343 --> 00:47:50,413
<font color="yellow">Was I inconsiderate?</font>

863
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:51,943
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll try to change now.</font>

864
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:54,143
<font color="yellow">Prof. Hong will take care of it even if you don't do it.</font>

865
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:55,613
<font color="yellow">Stay out of everything related to Hye Jung.</font>

866
00:47:56,143 --> 00:47:58,773
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you wanted her out? You're so capricious.</font>

867
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:02,513
<font color="yellow">The human mind is a capricious thing. Don't let it bother you.</font>

868
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:04,773
<font color="yellow">What brings you here anyway?</font>

869
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:06,013
<font color="yellow">Let's eat together.</font>

870
00:48:06,443 --> 00:48:07,813
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have plans.</font>

871
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:20,873
<font color="yellow">It's you.</font>

872
00:48:21,413 --> 00:48:22,613
<font color="yellow">I guess you're happy to see me.</font>

873
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:24,943
<font color="yellow">I brought sandwiches. Let's eat together.</font>

874
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:30,443
<font color="yellow">You're the only one who checks in on me nowadays.</font>

875
00:48:31,213 --> 00:48:33,413
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I threw a tantrum the other day.</font>

876
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:35,813
<font color="yellow">I guess throwing tantrums is for those who are good at it.</font>

877
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:38,913
<font color="yellow">No one cares because people are not used to seeing me like that.</font>

878
00:48:41,213 --> 00:48:42,213
<font color="yellow">Please eat.</font>

879
00:48:51,813 --> 00:48:52,813
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

880
00:48:53,113 --> 00:48:54,273
<font color="yellow">I have no appetite.</font>

881
00:48:58,043 --> 00:48:59,113
<font color="yellow">You're very pretty.</font>

882
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:03,873
<font color="yellow">I'm angry.</font>

883
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,943
<font color="yellow">I'm so livid!</font>

884
00:49:08,373 --> 00:49:10,543
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why did I live like a total fool?</font>

885
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:13,513
<font color="yellow">I should've learned to express my anger sooner and...</font>

886
00:49:13,673 --> 00:49:15,443
<font color="yellow">Please don't think like that.</font>

887
00:49:15,873 --> 00:49:17,943
<font color="yellow">You should live happily to show everyone.</font>

888
00:49:18,273 --> 00:49:20,573
<font color="yellow">I'm frustrated. I should go for a walk to get some fresh air.</font>

889
00:49:20,913 --> 00:49:21,913
<font color="yellow">Please stay in bed.</font>

890
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:23,313
<font color="yellow">You should still be resting.</font>

891
00:49:23,313 --> 00:49:24,643
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I'm invincible.</font>

892
00:49:24,813 --> 00:49:26,373
<font color="yellow">Unlucky ones live long lives.</font>

893
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:29,613
<font color="yellow">I survived like this because I met you and came here early enough.</font>

894
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:31,943
<font color="yellow">Look at me. I can jump too.</font>

895
00:49:32,743 --> 00:49:34,273
<font color="yellow">- One, two... - No, you can't do that now.</font>

896
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:35,273
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Three...</font>

897
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:37,473
<font color="yellow">- Four. - Ma'am, please lie down.</font>

898
00:49:39,513 --> 00:49:41,613
<font color="yellow">I told you not to do it!</font>

899
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:44,273
<font color="yellow">Ma'am! Ma'am!</font>

900
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:47,213
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

901
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:51,773
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, shock.</font>

902
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:54,313
<font color="yellow">Up it to 200.</font>

903
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:57,113
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, shock!</font>

904
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:03,413
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Ma'am! Ma'am!</font>

905
00:50:03,413 --> 00:50:05,143
