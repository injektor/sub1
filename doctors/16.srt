Why would he hit someone?</font>

<font color="yellow">Did it hurt a lot?</font>

31
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,433
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

32
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:10,254
<font color="yellow">Of course he's saying he's okay.
Would he say it hurts?</font>

38
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:24,886

41
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,714
<font color="yellow">He kept mouthing off to me.</font>

42
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,265
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I was mouthing off?</font>

43
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:41,356
<font color="yellow">I was just joking.</font>

44
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:44,514
<font color="yellow">There is only so much I can take.
What kind of joke is that?</font>

45
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:48,418
<font color="yellow">We are doctors. We need to be the best.</font>

46
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,807
<font color="yellow">Can't you control yourself?</font>

47
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,628
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

48
00:02:51,628 --> 00:02:54,188
<font color="yellow">- Why should you be sorry?
- Huh?</font>

49

<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, I've only worked with you
a little bit, so I didn't know.</font>

50
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,101
<font color="yellow">But you're not a bad guy.</font>

51
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:02,700
<font color="yellow">If someone treats you this way,
you treat them the way you see fit.</font>

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,720
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

53
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,801
<font color="yellow">Go now.</font>

54
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:12,863
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

55
00:03:14,115 --> 00:03:15,585
<font color="yellow">Isn't this wrong?</font>

56
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,836
<font color="yellow">I think so too.</font>

57
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,665
<font color="yellow">What's with the cotton for a nosebleed?</font>

58
00:03:19,064 --> 00:03:20,664
<font color="yellow">You are a doctor.</font>

59
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:22,277
<font color="yellow">That's for show, like in Hollywood.</font>

60
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:24,678
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to be like this?</font>

61
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:26,759
<font color="yellow">Trouble usually starts in the home so...</font>

62
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,898
<font color="yellow">If you get hit again,
you're in big trouble.</font>

63
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:36,446
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Let's just go eat.</font>

64
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,563
<font color="yellow">What a waste of your physical size.</font>

65
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:40,920
<font color="yellow">It was a surprise attack.</font>

66
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,128
<font color="yellow">What surprise attack? Come on.</font>

67
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:57,224
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?
Are you that tired?</font>

68
00:03:57,662 --> 00:03:59,815
<font color="yellow">I'm in my first year so it's expected.</font>

69
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:03,052
<font color="yellow">First years don't quite have
the knack for it yet.</font>

70
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:05,243
<font color="yellow">Still, you should utilize your time.</font>

71
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:07,093
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

72
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:08,885
<font color="yellow">- High five.
- Yes.</font>

73
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,507
<font color="yellow">What kind of mother are you?
Can you actually eat?</font>

74
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,085
<font color="yellow">Your daughter isn't even home.</font>

75
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,190
<font color="yellow">Why are you causing such a fuss?</font>

76
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:33,289
<font color="yellow">She often didn't come home
when she was last on duty.</font>

77
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,746
<font color="yellow">I told you that I yelled at her.</font>

78
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:35,979
<font color="yellow">You did a good thing.</font>

79
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,195
<font color="yellow">She needs to lose some affection for you
to know how precious her mother is.</font>

80
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,784
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What about it?</font>

81
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,864
<font color="yellow">She's always been too attached to you
ever since she was little.</font>

82
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:46,508
<font color="yellow">The two of you always did leave me out.</font>

83
00:04:46,508 --> 00:04:49,097
<font color="yellow">Stop saying these useless things
and go see her.</font>

84
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,325
<font color="yellow">What, exactly, did you do to her?</font>

85
00:04:52,186 --> 00:04:54,234
<font color="yellow">It's not like you hit her or anything.</font>

86
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:57,032
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Never mind.</font>

87
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,993
<font color="yellow">Sir, how are you?</font>

88
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:06,229
<font color="yellow">It still hurts so much.</font>

89
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:07,798
<font color="yellow">Where does it hurt?</font>

90
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:09,806
<font color="yellow">My eye, right here.</font>

91
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:14,498
<font color="yellow">My head hurts too and there's something
that keeps oozing from the wound.</font>

92
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:16,606
<font color="yellow">Are you giving him antibiotics?</font>

93
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,457
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're getting consults from the
Internal Medicine department too.</font>

94
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:23,275
<font color="yellow">Once he gets better,
stop the TPN and give him food.</font>

95
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,347
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director Jin Myung Hoon]</i></font>

96
00:05:37,522 --> 00:05:38,861
<font color="yellow">It's hard to see you.</font>

97
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

98
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,640
<font color="yellow">Didn't your father talk to you?</font>

99
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,621
<font color="yellow">I heard about the proposal for me
to become a board member.</font>

100
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,328
<font color="yellow">We will be nominating you
at the next board meeting.</font>

101
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,981
<font color="yellow">We're calling it a nomination,
but you're pretty much confirmed.</font>

102
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,368
<font color="yellow">I can't accept it.</font>

103
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:56,859
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have much work to do.</font>

104
00:05:56,859 --> 00:05:59,467
<font color="yellow">You would just have to take up a spot
and help Seo Woo.</font>

105
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:02,580
<font color="yellow">I like this hospital and
I want to continue working here.</font>

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,219
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have any ambition?</font>

107
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:07,436
<font color="yellow">I like being a doctor,
a doctor who helps sick people.</font>

108
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:08,912
<font color="yellow">That's what I like.</font>

109
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,674
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Seo Woo today?</font>

110
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:15,431
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Bring her to the VIP patient room.</font>

111
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:18,190
<font color="yellow">You know that Congressman Na has
been admitted into the hospital, right?</font>

112
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,669
<font color="yellow">She should get acquainted with him.</font>

113
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,525
<font color="yellow">You have to do things you don't want to
for the sake of your parents.</font>

114
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,284
<font color="yellow">No matter how much freedom
Chairman Jung has given you...</font>

115
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:41,808
<font color="yellow">You look very tired.</font>

116
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:43,472
<font color="yellow">That's how it is for first years.</font>

117
00:06:43,472 --> 00:06:45,861
<font color="yellow">If you get through it,
the second year will be much better.</font>

118
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:46,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:51,416
<font color="yellow"><i>[VIP Nurse]</i>
Gosh, he's calling me so often.</font>

120
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:54,657
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll be up soon.</font>

121
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:58,467
<font color="yellow">- Is it that congressman?
- Yes.</font>

122
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,986
<font color="yellow">Go change the dressing on Lee Jin Joo,
check her mental state, and chart it.</font>

123
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,036
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

but you're here, Doctor Hong.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh, is that so?</font>

129
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:27,746
<font color="yellow">Then let's do rounds.</font>

130
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:32,435

134
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:44,678
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm still in a lot of pain.
Are you giving me the proper painkillers?</font>

135
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:47,346
<font color="yellow">- Are you controlling his pain properly?
- Yes.</font>

136
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:49,734
<font color="yellow">If he continues to complain,
add on NSAIDs.</font>

137
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:50,808
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

138
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,166
<font color="yellow">We're not going to do surgery?</font>

139
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,974
<font color="yellow">Surgery won't be necessary.</font>

140
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,460
<font color="yellow">Tests showed that your disc issues
are not severe.</font>

141
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,810
<font color="yellow">We will manage it with painkillers,
then discharge you in one week.</font>

142
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,830
<font color="yellow">How can it be so simple?</font>

143
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,998
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're correct?</font>

144
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,049
<font color="yellow">It is correct.</font>

145
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,779
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and please rest.</font>

146
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,085

<font color="yellow">Why don't you stay awhile
since you're here?</font>

148
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,332
<font color="yellow">Let's talk a little.</font>

149
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:15,839
<font color="yellow">I would like to observe the lives of
people while I'm here in the hospital.</font>

150
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,063
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,614
<font color="yellow">How much do you make?
More than 100 million won?</font>

152
00:08:26,717 --> 00:08:28,520
<font color="yellow">Not as much as you would think.</font>

153
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,090
<font color="yellow">Should I speak to someone on your behalf?</font>

154
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,138
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

155
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:48,706
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

156
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:56,313
<font color="yellow">Oh, you were here, Doctor Yoo?</font>

157
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,924
<font color="yellow">How is Congressman Nam?</font>

158
00:08:57,924 --> 00:09:00,025
<font color="yellow">He's fine. I'll be going. then.</font>

159
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,768
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo is good in the workplace.
She has the natural disposition for it.</font>

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,081
<font color="yellow">You already managed to escape?</font>

161
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:19,319
<font color="yellow">I wasn't saying anything,
so he told me to go.</font>

162
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,202
<font color="yellow">I should go with Kang Soo next time.</font>

163
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:22,259
<font color="yellow">You could do that.</font>

164
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,313
<font color="yellow">He'll be discharged in a few days,
so wait a little bit.</font>

165
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,283
<font color="yellow">I am. I have to make a living, don't I?</font>

166
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,338
<font color="yellow">You've grown up a lot.</font>

167
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:29,661
<font color="yellow">I'm all grown up, actually.</font>

168
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,241
<font color="yellow">Oh! Have you had your vitamin D today?</font>

169
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:33,323
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

170
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,145
<font color="yellow">I like people who are dedicated.</font>

171
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,643
<font color="yellow">If you start something,
you should see it through to the end.</font>

172
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,824
<font color="yellow">What about the antioxidant?</font>

173
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:39,879
<font color="yellow">You're nagging.</font>

174
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,132
<font color="yellow">I'm still healthy.
You don't need to take care of me.</font>

175
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,304
<font color="yellow">Still, you're nine years older than me.</font>

176
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:46,576
<font color="yellow">I don't want you dying before I do.</font>

177
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,299
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly bringing up death?</font>

178
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,972
<font color="yellow">It's not sudden.</font>

179
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:54,212
<font color="yellow">People whom I love can't die before I do.</font>

180
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:57,544
<font color="yellow">You have to do that for me.</font>

181
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:00,683
<font color="yellow">How is Lee Hae Young doing?</font>

182
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,882
<font color="yellow">Should we go check on her now?</font>

183
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,973
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm finally wearing a wedding dress.</i></font>

184
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:31,919
<font color="yellow">Are you that happy?</font>

185
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,971
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

186
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,994
<font color="yellow">Our baby.</font>

187
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:39,620
<font color="yellow">I wanted us to get the formalities
over with before our baby is born.</font>

188
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,299
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry... and thank you.</font>

189
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,590
<font color="yellow">No, it was harder for you.</font>

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,242
<font color="yellow">You were always working
and getting our house ready.</font>

191
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:51,763
<font color="yellow">We'll get married and have our baby.</font>

192
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:53,763
<font color="yellow">We only have happiness in our future.</font>

193
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,380
<font color="yellow">Honey, I love you.</font>

194
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,948
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to say it back to me?</font>

195
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,592
<font color="yellow">I said I love you!</font>

196
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:33,307
<font color="yellow">Vitals?</font>

197
00:11:33,307 --> 00:11:35,350
<font color="yellow">Systolic blood pressure
has stabilized at 120.</font>

198
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,726
<font color="yellow">Her body temperature is between
36 to 37 degrees Celsius.</font>

199
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,917
<font color="yellow">I know it's a lot of work,
but check on her often.</font>

200
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:42,995
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

201
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:56,823
<font color="yellow">Hey. Keep her temperature
and BP at a normal level.</font>

202
00:11:56,823 --> 00:12:00,164
<font color="yellow">Do labs every day to check on
her hormone levels.</font>

203
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:02,286
<font color="yellow">Make a note if there are any changes.</font>

204
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,154
<font color="yellow">- Get obstetrics to come daily too.
- Okay.</font>

205
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:08,303
<font color="yellow">You two work really well together.</font>

206
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,447
<font color="yellow">What is that supposed to mean?</font>

207
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,587
<font color="yellow">What? It doesn't mean anything.</font>

208
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,379
<font color="yellow">You're being absurd.</font>

209
00:12:17,997 --> 00:12:19,018
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

210
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:27,607
<font color="yellow">How long must she live
for the baby to survive?</font>

211
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:33,281
<font color="yellow">The baby has a higher chance to live if
we can incubate the baby at 24 weeks.</font>

212
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,598
<font color="yellow">However...</font>

213
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,485
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone</font>

214
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,658
<font color="yellow">if the patient couldn't survive
even 10 minutes.</font>

215
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:50,275
<font color="yellow">I regret it so much, Doctor.</font>

216
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,005
<font color="yellow">Don't blame yourself.</font>

217
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:56,861
<font color="yellow">You're doing very well.</font>

218
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,021
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

219
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:03,078
<font color="yellow">I never told her that I loved her.</font>

220
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,010
<font color="yellow">That's what I regret the most.</font>

221
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:11,029
<font color="yellow">I thought that words were so precious.</font>

222
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,558
<font color="yellow">I was going to do it at the wedding
during my vows.</font>

223
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:27,223
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she knows how you feel.</font>

224
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,369
<font color="yellow">She's fighting with her dying breath
to protect the baby.</font>

225
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,338
<font color="yellow"><i>Where are you?</i></font>

226
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,284
<font color="yellow"><i>Going to the fellow room.</i></font>

227
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,242
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop and don't move.</i></font>

228
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:10,294
<font color="yellow"><i>[Stop and don't move.]</i></font>

229
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:50,755
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

230
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,090
<font color="yellow">I've never told you, have I?</font>

231
00:14:54,555 --> 00:14:55,785
<font color="yellow">Told me what?</font>

232
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,192
<font color="yellow">I love you, Hye Jung.</font>

233
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:10,266
<font color="yellow">You ran here to tell me that?</font>

234
00:15:10,266 --> 00:15:11,405
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

235
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,607
<font color="yellow">No matter when or what the situation,
I didn't want to end up regretting it.</font>

236
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,831
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

237
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,151
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't keep doing this
in the hospital.</font>

238
00:16:08,377 --> 00:16:09,905
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you doing it?</font>

239
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:11,717
<font color="yellow">Doing what?</font>

240
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:15,535
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to say it.</font>

241
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,174
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

242
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:20,145
<font color="yellow">They're such precious words.
I don't want to say them out loud yet.</font>

243
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:26,688
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung.</font>

244
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,848
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do that assignment later.</font>

245
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:37,063
<font color="yellow">I won't be seeing you again today.</font>

246
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,246
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

247
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:59,726
<font color="yellow">Doctor Pi, where did
Doctor Ahn Joong Dae run away to?</font>

248
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,806
<font color="yellow">It's a big mystery.</font>

249
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,396
<font color="yellow">I worried about him for no reason.</font>

250
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,994
<font color="yellow">Lee Mi Ja is on painkillers, right?</font>

251
00:17:08,073 --> 00:17:10,273
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Increase by half an ampoule.</font>

252
00:17:10,912 --> 00:17:12,063
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

253
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,557
<font color="yellow">Young Gook.</font>

254
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,478
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

255
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,390
<font color="yellow">Why? Were you feeling conflicted
after the bad thing I did?</font>

256
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,681
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

257
00:17:32,253 --> 00:17:35,199
<font color="yellow">I don't want to ask about your feelings.
I'm the important one here.</font>

258
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:38,663
<font color="yellow">I want us to continue being friends.</font>

259
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:40,782
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

260
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,421
<font color="yellow">No... I just changed my mind.</font>

261
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,457
<font color="yellow">I'm suddenly curious about your feelings.</font>

262
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,699
<font color="yellow">I don't want to tell you.</font>

263
00:17:53,261 --> 00:17:54,969
<font color="yellow">We're just friends, anyway.</font>

264
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,012
<font color="yellow">Friends.</font>

265
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,659
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

266
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,235
<font color="yellow">You don't give up, do you?</font>

267
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,790
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired of
hearing the same thing?</font>

268
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,017
<font color="yellow">That's why I brought something new.</font>

269
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:42,390
<font color="yellow">I noticed you accessed
my grandma's medical files.</font>

270
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,550
<font color="yellow">This was before they were destroyed.</font>

271
00:18:46,735 --> 00:18:47,806
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

272
00:18:55,828 --> 00:18:58,409
<font color="yellow">You have the anesthesiology
records, don't you?</font>

273
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,090
<font color="yellow">Why would I have those?</font>

274
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,309
<font color="yellow">If you had no intentions of keeping them</font>

275
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,663
<font color="yellow">why did you open and access files
of a surgery that happened 10 years ago?</font>

276
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,110
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything better to do?</font>

277
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,033
<font color="yellow">Even if you tell me,
no one's life is going to change.</font>

278
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:15,739
<font color="yellow">It's legally too late to do anything.</font>

279
00:19:18,922 --> 00:19:21,173
<font color="yellow">You would just be telling me
as a fellow doctor.</font>

280
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,975
<font color="yellow">Give me time to think about it.</font>

281
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:37,199
<font color="yellow">Joong Dae...
Gosh, my head hurts. Can you...</font>

282
00:19:43,687 --> 00:19:46,504
<font color="yellow">My head, my head...</font>

283
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,900
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, what are you looking for?</font>

284
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,284
<font color="yellow">Acetaminophen.</font>

285
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,358
<font color="yellow">You seem to get headaches often.</font>

286
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,361
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

287
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:05,129
<font color="yellow">I just don't like it
even if hurts a little.</font>

288
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:08,519
<font color="yellow">I take medicine if it hurts a little
or even if it seems like it will hurt.</font>

289
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:11,889
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you can't handle pain.</font>

290
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:13,582
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

291
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:15,379
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

292
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,997
<font color="yellow">- Here it is.
- Thank you.</font>

293
00:20:19,997 --> 00:20:21,218
<font color="yellow">Water.</font>

294
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:23,823
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

295
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,628
<font color="yellow">Okay. All better.</font>

296
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,129
<font color="yellow">Young Gook!</font>

297
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,187
<font color="yellow">I'm here to pick up
what I ordered yesterday.</font>

298
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:39,309
<font color="yellow">Ah, yes.</font>

299
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:44,444
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

300
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,794
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

301
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:48,765
<font color="yellow">Wow! Joong Dae, you're studying hard.</font>

302
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:50,390
<font color="yellow">You'll become a professor.</font>

303
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,271
<font color="yellow">Studying like this for 100 days
won't help you get high grades.</font>

304
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:55,100
<font color="yellow">You need to get good study notes.</font>

305
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:58,441
<font color="yellow">- Young Gook, do you have study notes?
- No.</font>

306
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:00,565
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to study?</font>

307
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,763
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do well on the test.
It doesn't really matter.</font>

308
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,291
<font color="yellow">I'll suffer through the embarrassment.</font>

309
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,929
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry. Order some food.</font>

310
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,167
<font color="yellow">Uh... that won't be on the test.</font>

311
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,430
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

312
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,768
<font color="yellow">When did our department
get so cold and fickle?</font>

313
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:21,324
<font color="yellow">You guys are hungry, right?</font>

314
00:21:21,324 --> 00:21:24,409
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness! What is this? Wow!</font>

315
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,544
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

316
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:28,929
<font color="yellow">Hey, eat.</font>

317
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,876
<font color="yellow">Wow! It looks so good.</font>

318
00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:32,802
<font color="yellow">Wow, is it some sort of special day?</font>

319
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,033
<font color="yellow">I was hungry so this is great.</font>

320
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:37,362
<font color="yellow">This must be about Professor Hong.
Do you have a rivalry with him?</font>

321
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,512
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how to accept things
with a pure heart?</font>

322
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,292
<font color="yellow">I am very sorry.</font>

323
00:21:42,292 --> 00:21:43,888
<font color="yellow">It looks so delicious.</font>

324
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,178
<font color="yellow">I think I need to lie down.</font>

325
00:21:46,178 --> 00:21:47,800
<font color="yellow">This is a historical day.</font>

326
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,118
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung's buying us food
after my three years here.</font>

327
00:21:50,118 --> 00:21:51,706
<font color="yellow">Hey, you guys are really funny.</font>

328
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:54,451
<font color="yellow">Didn't I pay for us when we
went to hospital outings?</font>

329
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:57,027
<font color="yellow">- I don't recall that.
- Neither do I.</font>

330
00:21:57,027 --> 00:22:00,498
<font color="yellow">I think I might remember if I eat this.</font>

331
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:02,570
<font color="yellow">This is getting more
and more interesting.</font>

332
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,391
<font color="yellow">What? What do you want to eat?</font>

333
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,490
<font color="yellow">You pigs. Round face, one and two.</font>

334
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,977
<font color="yellow">Round face? Who is one?</font>

335
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,684
<font color="yellow">One... and two.</font>

336
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:14,946
<font color="yellow">That hurts, that hurts...</font>

337
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,466
<font color="yellow">Don't hit Joong Dae.
He's going to leave again.</font>

338
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:18,593
<font color="yellow">I get tired when he's gone.</font>

339
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,053
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'll be two. You're right.</font>

340
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,339
<font color="yellow">We really are round though.</font>

341
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:40,224
<font color="yellow"><i>Should I help you with something?</i></font>

342
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:43,082
<font color="yellow">No, don't do a thing.</font>

343
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:58,257
<font color="yellow">I get to eat the first thing
Yoo Hye Jung has ever cooked.</font>

344
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:03,927
<font color="yellow">Are you testing it out on me
before you give it to Teacher Hong?</font>

345
00:23:03,927 --> 00:23:06,220
<font color="yellow">Are you watching a different
genre of TV dramas lately?</font>

346
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,398
<font color="yellow">Things with conspiracies,
lies, and deceit in them.</font>

347
00:23:09,398 --> 00:23:11,409
<font color="yellow">You sure hold a grudge.</font>

348
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:16,633
<font color="yellow">Doctor Ahn Joong Dae was asking me
to hide him, so what could I do?</font>

349
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:17,720
<font color="yellow">He had nowhere to go.</font>

350
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,928
<font color="yellow">Do you take in everyone
with nowhere to go?</font>

351
00:23:19,928 --> 00:23:20,957
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

352
00:23:22,494 --> 00:23:25,823
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's been so long
since I've had time like this.</font>

353
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:29,710
<font color="yellow">Did something good happen today?</font>

354
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,775
<font color="yellow">I feel more relaxed
about my life these days.</font>

355
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:36,141
<font color="yellow">Teacher Hong has accomplished a lot.</font>

356
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,011
<font color="yellow">How could I be here today
if I didn't have you?</font>

357
00:23:40,011 --> 00:23:41,800
<font color="yellow">I feel the same way.</font>

358
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,740
<font color="yellow">I think things might work out
with my grandma too.</font>

359
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,695
<font color="yellow">I think a doctor who was in the
operating room might talk to me.</font>

360
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:50,470
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo came and asked me about it.</font>

361
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,551
<font color="yellow">She asked me if I knew why
you were at Gookil Hospital.</font>

362
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,921
<font color="yellow">I told her that I didn't know why.</font>

363
00:23:56,921 --> 00:24:01,430
<font color="yellow">How can I tell her that her dad
led the surgery on your grandma?</font>

364
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,509
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say that to her.</font>

365
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,301
<font color="yellow">Cheon Soon Hee, I like you so much.</font>

366
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:12,265
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung, I like you so much too.</font>

367
00:24:14,516 --> 00:24:16,221
<font color="yellow">But, you know...</font>

368
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,400
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bring up your grandma to you.</font>

369
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:24,958
<font color="yellow">So, I had hoped that you would find
happiness with Teacher Hong.</font>

370
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,278
<font color="yellow">Then I thought that you would
forget about your grandma.</font>

371
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:30,748
<font color="yellow">You didn't, though.</font>

372
00:24:30,748 --> 00:24:33,669
<font color="yellow">My grandma is my grandma and
Doctor Hong is Doctor Hong.</font>

373
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,753
<font color="yellow">He's actually helping me out with this.</font>

374
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,841
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I think we need to
get divorced now.</font>

375
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,287
<font color="yellow">We've lived together for too long.</font>

376
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:50,518
<font color="yellow">Still... you look happy, so I'm happy.</font>

377
00:24:50,993 --> 00:24:52,277
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

378

<font color="yellow">So nice.</font>

380
00:25:03,152 --> 00:25:05,406
<font color="yellow">How are you administering medication
to Kim Tae Soo?</font>

381
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,324
<font color="yellow">We're giving it to him through PO.</font>

382

- As for pain... hold on.</font>

385
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:16,769
<font color="yellow">It's my younger brother in the army.</font>

386

<font color="yellow">Are you doing okay?</font>

389
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:28,623
<font color="yellow">I'm so busy that I had
no time to go visit you.</font>

390
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,073
<font color="yellow">You were given an explanation
of the surgery, right?</font>

391
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:35,126
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

392
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,518
<font color="yellow">Your arm has good strength too.
Don't worry too much.</font>

393
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,188
<font color="yellow">Get a central line in</font>

394
00:25:43,188 --> 00:25:46,008
<font color="yellow">and we'll need to go to the ICU
after surgery, so prepare for that.</font>

395
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,155
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

VVIP patient during your surgery?</font>

399
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,169
<font color="yellow">I have to say it's okay even if it's not.</font>

400
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:06,080

I hope he hasn't gotten worse.</font>

401
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,100

They'd call Professor Hong then.</font>

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,892
<font color="yellow">I'll open the door.</font>

403

406
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:32,656
<font color="yellow">It hurts everywhere.</font>

407
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:37,676
<font color="yellow">You can't tell me in such vague terms.
You need to tell me more details.</font>

You can give me the shot, Doctor Yoo.</font>

Can you keep an eye on him for me?</font>

00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:12,622
<font color="yellow">It's Kang Soo. I called for him.</font>

603
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:13,972
<font color="yellow">I had some questions for him.</font>

604
00:42:13,972 --> 00:42:15,548
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

605
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:26,093
<font color="yellow">We need to know all the facts
to have a countermeasure.</font>

606
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,383
<font color="yellow">That's my theory.</font>

607
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:29,490
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's sort things out.</font>

608
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:32,048
<font color="yellow">There's some empty time.</font>

609
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:35,336
<font color="yellow">The VIP nurse called Doctor Jin.</font>

610
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:37,070
<font color="yellow">She couldn't reach her,
so she called Doctor Yoo.</font>

611
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,999
<font color="yellow">She couldn't reach Doctor Yoo.
She called you, Kang Soo.</font>

612
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,706
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you go up
when you got the call?</font>

613
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,503
<font color="yellow">That's the thing...</font>

614
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:45,827
<font color="yellow">That's the thing that's driving me crazy.</font>

615
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:48,898
<font color="yellow">I never got a call from the VIP nurse.</font>

616
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,784
<font color="yellow">- Kang Soo.
- Yes?</font>

617
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:53,034
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to criticize you.</font>

618
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:55,164
<font color="yellow">This issue isn't about one person.</font>

619
00:42:55,164 --> 00:42:57,892
<font color="yellow">A Neurosurgery fellow and
residents are all involved in this.</font>

620
00:42:57,892 --> 00:42:59,532
<font color="yellow">We all need to survive.</font>

621
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:05,653
<font color="yellow">I'm really telling the truth here.</font>

622
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:14,903
<font color="yellow"><i>[Choi Kang Soo]</i></font>

623
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:18,836
<font color="yellow">Wow! Is a ghost playing tricks on me?</font>

624
00:43:19,718 --> 00:43:21,447
<font color="yellow">She really did call me.</font>

625
00:43:23,188 --> 00:43:24,296
<font color="yellow">She did call you.</font>

626
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:26,599
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you she didn't.
It has to be an error.</font>

627
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,157
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look at mine.</font>

628
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,186
<font color="yellow"><i>[VIP Nurse]</i></font>

629

630
00:43:42,452 --> 00:43:43,700

631
00:43:46,014 --> 00:43:47,124
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

632
00:43:48,403 --> 00:43:51,693
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with your brain?
How come you can't remember?</font>

633
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:56,624
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

634
00:43:57,256 --> 00:43:59,409
<font color="yellow">I will go and tell them.</font>

635
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,055
<font color="yellow">No, I'm responsible for it.</font>

636
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,276
<font color="yellow">He was a patient assigned to me.</font>

637
00:44:03,276 --> 00:44:05,336
<font color="yellow">There's nothing you should be
held responsible for.</font>

00:44:11,325 --> 00:44:12,617
<font color="yellow"><i>[Director's Office]</i></font>

639
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,282
<font color="yellow">This is Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

640
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,271
<font color="yellow"><i>The director would like to see you.</i></font>

641
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,747
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about what happened today.</font>

642
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:34,398
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for it.</font>

643
00:44:34,398 --> 00:44:35,747
<font color="yellow">I like that attitude.</font>

644
00:44:36,827 --> 00:44:40,767
<font color="yellow">You'll come before the disciplinary
committee and will be held responsible.</font>

645
00:44:42,356 --> 00:44:46,026
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you may think,
but this is the kind of person I am.</font>

646
00:44:46,026 --> 00:44:48,334
<font color="yellow">I am reasonable and generous.</font>

647
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:50,776
<font color="yellow">I let you off once before.</font>

648
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:54,242
<font color="yellow">Not this time.</font>

649
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:55,715
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

650
00:45:10,686 --> 00:45:13,247
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- What happened?</font>

651
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:19,294
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo will be getting disciplined.</font>

652
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:20,947
<font color="yellow">I can't shield her.</font>

653
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:24,300
<font color="yellow">All of the fellows and residents of
our department are mixed up in it.</font>

654
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,954
<font color="yellow">They need a sacrificial lamb.</font>

655
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:27,126
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

656
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:29,845
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo was his doctor.</font>

657
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:32,481
<font color="yellow">Even if he wasn't critical,
she shouldn't have been careless.</font>

658
00:45:33,244 --> 00:45:36,314
<font color="yellow">Or she should have put him in the care
of someone she could trust.</font>

659
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:38,314
<font color="yellow">You can't allow a disciplinary committee.</font>

660
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:41,499
<font color="yellow">If this goes to the committee,
it will disgrace her name as a doctor.</font>

661
00:45:41,499 --> 00:45:43,061
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I know that?</font>

662
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,427
<font color="yellow">But I can't make this into a
Neurosurgery department issue.</font>

663
00:45:57,113 --> 00:45:58,751
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming from that direction?</font>

664
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:00,709
<font color="yellow">Are you coming from
the fellow room?</font>

665
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:01,840
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

666
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,090
<font color="yellow">Were you comforting Hye Jung?</font>

667
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,885
<font color="yellow">If I can be a source of comfort...</font>

668
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:08,081
<font color="yellow">Why would you bother doing
something so pointless?</font>

669
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:11,631
<font color="yellow">You can do that for 100 days.
She'll only love Hong Ji Hong.</font>

670
00:46:11,631 --> 00:46:14,026
<font color="yellow">It's love because I'm doing
pointless things.</font>

671
00:46:14,026 --> 00:46:16,450
<font color="yellow">Did you always have
this naive side to you?</font>

672
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,592
<font color="yellow">I did. It was just in a
deep sleep inside my heart.</font>

673
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:22,747
<font color="yellow">Whatever, I don't know.
I don't care about Doctor Yoo's problems.</font>

674
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:24,552
<font color="yellow">You are really a sad sight.</font>

675
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:28,296
<font color="yellow">Don't you hate Hye Jung?
She won't even accept your feelings.</font>

676
00:46:28,296 --> 00:46:32,389
<font color="yellow">I'm doing what I feel and
Doctor Yoo is doing what she feels.</font>

677
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,197
<font color="yellow">We're both just following our hearts.</font>

678
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,566
<font color="yellow">Well, aren't you just a saint?</font>

679
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:53,910
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

680
00:46:59,577 --> 00:47:03,608
<font color="yellow">Isn't it wrong for Doctor Yoo to
take the blame all by herself?</font>

681
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:05,119
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

682
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,947
<font color="yellow">I wish Congressman Na Min Soo
would wake up.</font>

683
00:47:07,947 --> 00:47:10,396
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't, things could get
really problematic.</font>

684
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:11,977
<font color="yellow">Isn't this all unfair though?</font>

685
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:14,764
<font color="yellow">How can anyone know about a hypertensive
brain hemorrhage until it happens?</font>

686
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:16,010
<font color="yellow">You only know when it happens.</font>

687
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,211
<font color="yellow">It doesn't show up in tests.</font>

688
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,747
<font color="yellow">- How can anyone be held responsible?
- You're right.</font>

689
00:47:19,747 --> 00:47:21,320
<font color="yellow">They want people to be held
responsible for everything.</font>

690
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,075
<font color="yellow">- It should be fine if he recovers.
- Yeah.</font>

691
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,358
<font color="yellow">Just go to sleep, would you?</font>

692
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:52,240
<font color="yellow">You seem to get headaches often.</font>

693
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,090
<font color="yellow">Yes, Nurse.</font>

694
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,251
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong with your brain?
How come you can't remember?</font>

695
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:22,374
<font color="yellow">One shot, one shot, one shot!</font>

696
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:39,544
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Oh, hey! You're here?</font>

697
00:48:42,704 --> 00:48:44,764
<font color="yellow">I have a favor to ask.</font>

698
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:46,905
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

699
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,854
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

700
00:50:02,787 --> 00:50:03,918
<font color="yellow">Professor.</font>

701
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,825
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo, what is it?</font>

702
00:50:06,575 --> 00:50:08,700
<font color="yellow">I had something to ask you.
Do you have time?</font>

703
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,419
<font color="yellow">Yes, come sit down.</font>

704
00:50:12,244 --> 00:50:15,622
<font color="yellow">These are my friend's CT and MRI scans.</font>

705
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:17,360
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you could take a look.</font>

706
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,921
<font color="yellow">He must have a doctor if he has CT scans.</font>

707
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,050
<font color="yellow">He's scared and very nervous.</font>

708
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:26,472
<font color="yellow">So, he wants to get second opinions
from other hospitals too.</font>

709
00:50:27,139 --> 00:50:28,990
<font color="yellow">Can't you give your opinion?</font>

710
00:50:29,689 --> 00:50:30,742
<font color="yellow">I can.</font>

711
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:32,820
<font color="yellow">It looks like a meningioma.</font>

712
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,468
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a meningioma
near the sphenoid bone.</font>

713
00:50:36,468 --> 00:50:38,059
<font color="yellow">It's very large too.</font>

714
00:50:39,889 --> 00:50:43,150
<font color="yellow">He's also experiencing absence seizures.</font>

715
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,939
<font color="yellow">He's been zoning out and blacking out.</font>

716
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:47,918
<font color="yellow">He's having trouble remembering things.</font>

717
00:50:47,918 --> 00:50:51,289
<font color="yellow">A meningioma along with absence seizures.
That's pretty unique.</font>

718
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:54,289
<font color="yellow">Tell him to get it treated quickly.
Is he a close friend of yours?</font>

719
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:28,619
<font color="yellow">I just saw Director Jin.</font>

720
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,456
<font color="yellow">This issue will proceed according to
the rules and procedure.</font>

721
00:51:32,555 --> 00:51:35,064
<font color="yellow">I was going to go meet the director now.</font>

722
00:51:35,064 --> 00:51:38,186
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to make any
requests to him on my behalf.</font>

723
00:51:38,671 --> 00:51:40,349
<font color="yellow">It's not because it's you.</font>

724
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:42,889
<font color="yellow">I would do it for anyone
who had to go through this.</font>

725
00:51:42,889 --> 00:51:46,588
<font color="yellow">I would to protect my pride,
at least with him.</font>

726
00:51:48,662 --> 00:51:52,041
<font color="yellow">I was the congressman's doctor.
It is my fault.</font>

727
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:57,640
<font color="yellow">I met with Section Chief Kim Chi Hyun.
He was different than before.</font>

728
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,014
<font color="yellow">I have hope that I can resolve my
grandma's issue soon.</font>

729
00:52:02,014 --> 00:52:04,153
<font color="yellow">Good. That's a relief.</font>

730
00:52:04,885 --> 00:52:07,979
<font color="yellow">To a person who likes
rules and procedures</font>

731
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:10,666
<font color="yellow">I want to deal with him in that same way.</font>

732
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:14,626
<font color="yellow">I want you to just to watch over me.</font>

733
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:17,419
<font color="yellow">Watch how I deal with it instead.</font>

734
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:19,561
<font color="yellow">It's not so easy for me.</font>

735
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:24,568
<font color="yellow">Not doing anything in this situation
is very hard for me.</font>

736
00:52:29,151 --> 00:52:31,427
<font color="yellow">What did I say you should do
in times like this?</font>

737
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,137
<font color="yellow">I know I taught you.</font>

738
00:52:35,847 --> 00:52:37,586
<font color="yellow">I can't do it here.</font>

739
00:52:38,887 --> 00:52:41,108
<font color="yellow">We can find a place
where we can be alone.</font>

740
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,465
<font color="yellow">Doctor...</font>

741
00:53:08,465 --> 00:53:10,389
<font color="yellow">You're right. Someone might come.</font>

742
00:53:17,787 --> 00:53:20,863
<font color="yellow"><i>Congressman Na Min Soo has received
surgery from a brain hemorrhage.</i></font>

743
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,822
<font color="yellow"><i>He is currently unconsciousness.</i></font>

744
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:26,782

<font color="yellow">What is Congressman Na's illness
and what are his symptoms?</font>

750
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,671
<font color="yellow">He had a hypertensive brain hemorrhage.</font>

751
00:53:39,671 --> 00:53:42,631
<font color="yellow">His capillaries and veins were
being damaged for a long time.</font>

752
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:45,691
<font color="yellow">The blood vessels could no longer
withstand the pressure and ruptured.</font>

753
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:49,405
<font color="yellow">It was not caused by any external factor.
It was a brain hemorrhage.</font>

754
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:53,222
<font color="yellow">What state is he in right now?</font>

755
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:54,691
<font color="yellow">Is there a chance he will wake up?</font>

756
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:56,552
<font color="yellow">The surgery was a success.</font>

757
00:53:56,552 --> 00:53:58,441
<font color="yellow">We are checking his progress.</font>

758
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:01,901
<font color="yellow">You say that,
but he is still unconscious.</font>

759
00:54:01,901 --> 00:54:04,586
<font color="yellow">That is common for patients
who have had brain surgery.</font>

760
00:54:04,586 --> 00:54:08,434
<font color="yellow">I cannot give you a
conclusive statement right now.</font>

761
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:09,602
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

762
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:34,698
<font color="yellow">He's gone from a semi-coma to a stupor.</font>

763
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,664
<font color="yellow">Now it's done.</font>

764
00:54:44,691 --> 00:54:47,943
<font color="yellow">Check his vitals often
and change his dressing.</font>

765
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,780
<font color="yellow">He should be okay now.</font>

766
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,499
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

767
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,162
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

768
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:59,171
<font color="yellow">I'll use this opportunity to set this
hospital on the right path again.</font>

769
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,530

of Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

<font color="yellow">Why did you call me?</font>

771
00:55:30,084 --> 00:55:33,175
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It's all my fault.</font>

772
00:55:33,175 --> 00:55:34,611
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

773
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:36,660
<font color="yellow">This should be happening to me.</font>

774
00:55:37,664 --> 00:55:39,425
<font color="yellow">I'll take responsibility for everything.</font>

775
00:55:40,834 --> 00:55:43,327
<font color="yellow">Do you think just anyone can take
responsibility for things?</font>

776
00:55:43,327 --> 00:55:46,883
<font color="yellow">It's because it's me that I can do it.
I'm kind of great.</font>

777
00:55:50,173 --> 00:55:54,073
<font color="yellow">Even the way you comfort people
is on a different level.</font>

778
00:55:54,073 --> 00:55:56,983
<font color="yellow">Thanks for recognizing
that I was comforting you.</font>

779
00:55:56,983 --> 00:55:58,499
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

785

I was in your dream?</font>
