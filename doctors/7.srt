<i>[Doctor Crush]</i>

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,869
<i>Do you think I don't know you
were with that woman last night?</i>

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:11,714
<i>[Episode 7]
Here you go again!</i>

5
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:13,531
<i>Why can't you just trust me?</i>

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,007
<i>Where do you think you're going?
You can't go!</i>

7
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,142
<i>Let go of me!</i>

8
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:20,552
<i>I'll die you if you leave!</i>

9
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:23,990
<i>Fine! Do whatever you want.
Die or not. It's up to you!</i>

10
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:59,637
<i>To me, love between a man and woman
means fighting until one ends up dying.</i>

11
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,592
Oh, it's cold! It's cold!

12
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>I don't know how to love a man.</i>

13
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,798
<i>As a woman...</i>

14
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:07,984
Are we dating now?

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,503
<i>I don't know how to receive love.</i>

16
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,994
I'm going to do something right now.

17
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:21,093
Man to woman.

18
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:28,633
<i>He's going to kiss me.
I have to avoid it.</i>

19
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:32,294
<i>Turn away. Hurry.</i>

20
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:04,418
<i>I'm not going to die because of
a man's love like Mom did.</i>

21
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,051
Hye Jung!

22
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:13,543
At first, I ran away like you did.

23
00:02:16,624 --> 00:02:18,953
I'm not going to ask you
that question a second time.

24
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:21,303
Why not?

25
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,567
You don't need to move.

26
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,733
I'm going to come to you.

27
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,495
The person who knows love
has to make the first move.

28
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,075
You don't have to move.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,536
If you don't know,
just stay put until you know.

30
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:58,716
Thanks for caring so much
about my patient.

31
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:00,345
It's so unfair.

32
00:03:01,663 --> 00:03:05,084
What good did it do to live her whole
life being good and working hard?

33
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,122
This is unexpected.
I didn't know you could feel this way.

34
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,756
Why is it unexpected?

35
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,805
I thought you wouldn't know
what unfairness was like.

36
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,222
That's not true.

37
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,533
I've been holding a lot in, as well.

38
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,603
Though, I'll explode and
let everything out one day.

39
00:03:20,473 --> 00:03:22,323
It doesn't seem like you're holding back.

40
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,303
I love you.

41
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:28,733
I told you I liked you before, right?

42
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,144
Well, I was lying.

43
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,493
I guess you did explode, after all.

44
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,704
This is what I was planning on
telling you at the restaurant that day.

45
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,776
I didn't want to hear this from you.

46
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,339
I'm a bad guy.

47
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:45,430
If a guy tells you himself that he's bad,
that means he's a really bad guy.

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,786
You knew how I felt.
You just pretended not to know.

49
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,508
I didn't want to torture you
with false hope.

50
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:54,350
I don't care about torturing myself
if there is a small hint of hope.

51
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,723
You're being stubborn.

52
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:59,053
This is why I tried to stop you from
telling me your feelings.

53
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:01,912
Then, promise me something.

54
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,530
Don't like anyone else
for another six months.

55
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,863
Since you rejected me,
that's the least you can do for me.

56
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,131
I've already started...

57
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,703
What?

58
00:04:15,674 --> 00:04:18,162
Who? When?

59
00:04:18,162 --> 00:04:20,225
You haven't had time to meet women.

60
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:22,364
Is it Hye Jung, by any chance?

61
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:23,777
I'm getting goosebumps.

62
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,448
You girls and your intuition, seriously.

63
00:04:27,996 --> 00:04:29,607
Why does it have to be her?

64
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:33,480
How would I know why it's her?

65
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:36,556
How can I control who I like?

66
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:39,931
I want to throw this right now.

67
00:04:43,198 --> 00:04:44,527
That must be Young Gook.

68
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:55,198
I called him to watch over you.

69
00:04:56,648 --> 00:04:57,898
Where are you going?

70
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,809
Something unfortunate
happened to my patient.

71
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:03,650
I'm not in a position to
comfort anyone right now.

72
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:13,910
Does he have to be a show-off
like that all the time?

73
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,664
What's the matter?

74
00:05:18,664 --> 00:05:21,003
Why do bad things happen
all at once like this?

75
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,951
Do you want to go for a drink?

76
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:33,734
Was this taken after
Oh Young Mi passed out?

77
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,443
Yes, after intubation.

78
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:37,833
But, why do you need her angiography now?

79
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,982
I need to know what went wrong!

80
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:43,383
There was nothing we could do
after the examination.

81
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,534
There's a blood clot in the lungs.
It's pulmonary thrombosis.

82
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:50,722
Did she have any symptoms after
she was moved to her room?

83
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:54,172
No, we didn't see anything
in her CT either.

84
00:05:56,277 --> 00:05:58,506
- Contact the guardian.
- Yes.

85
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,124
Here you go.

86
00:06:06,124 --> 00:06:08,412
Enjoy your food.

87
00:06:08,412 --> 00:06:10,244
Is this the only place to drink?

88
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,809
This is the new, hot place for our
hospital employees to go.

89
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,289
Hey, Seo Woo!

90
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:18,337
Hey!

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,669
Oh my, look at that girl.

92
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,193
How could she do that to a friend
she hasn't seen in so long?

93
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:28,501
I thought you were 26 years old.

94
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,587
You must have started school
at the age of three.

95
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:34,780
- I'll give you free appetizers.
- Deal.

96
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:47,837
What's the other bad thing
that happened besides Oh Young Mi?

97
00:06:47,837 --> 00:06:49,556
Did Jung Yoon Do do something again?

98
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:52,280
I'll tell you once I've cleared my mind.

99
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,707
I can't tell you now
because my pride is too hurt.

100
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:58,056
Why are you drinking so much?

101
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,597
Oh, it's our CEO.

102
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,114
I noticed you're still Hye Jung's lackey.

103
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:11,450
Come on, now...

104
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,640
She had a bad day,
so she's not in a very good state.

105
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,883
I know her very well too.

106
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:19,044
I don't pay attention to
what she says. Don't worry.

107
00:07:19,044 --> 00:07:20,775
- Good.
- Hey!

108
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:22,653
Pour me a drink.

109
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:25,825
Hey, what do you take me for?

110
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:27,681
Straight?

111
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:30,076
It's very strong.

112
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,994
Goodness...

113
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,638
He must have a very weak tolerance.

114
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:36,945
He's weak to everything.

115
00:07:36,945 --> 00:07:40,472
How long have you been with Hye Jung?

116
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:42,903
We moved in together right after
I graduated high school.

117
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,772
My dad tried to send me off to Canada.

118
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:47,898
What did Hye Jung do all that time?

119
00:07:47,898 --> 00:07:50,826
She studied and passed her GED.

120
00:07:50,826 --> 00:07:53,787
We came up to Seoul with the money
that her grandma left her.

121
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:57,898
I heard that her grandma passed away.

122
00:07:57,898 --> 00:08:01,116
Then she left with some gangster guy.

123
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,316
Didn't they live together?

124
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,641
No! I told you she lived with me.

125
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:07,785
There was a time before
she lived with you.

126
00:08:07,785 --> 00:08:09,994
What are you talking about? I...

127
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:13,114
Oh, thank you. Bye.

128
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:15,753
Oh! Isn't that him?

129
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,203
It is him.

130
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,883
But he doesn't recognize me at all.

131
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:22,938
- Hey!
- What are you doing?

132
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:24,814
- Hey, don't do it.
- Stop right there!

133
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:28,095
Hey, stop that! Don't do it.

134
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:32,142
Don't you know me?

135
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:35,046
I'm Hye Jung's friend.

136
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:38,162
- I know.
- See, he knows.

137
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,532
Should I give you Hye Jung's number?

138
00:08:40,532 --> 00:08:41,552
Forget it.

139
00:08:41,552 --> 00:08:45,792
I'm sure you'll see her anyway if you
continue delivering to this store.

140
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:49,822
Did you know Hye Jung became a doctor?

141
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,926
You seem very drunk right now.

142
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,444
You picked the wrong guy to
start something with.

143
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:56,973
Are you looking down on me
just because I live this way?

144
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:02,415
What? Who does he think he is? Hey!

145
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,646
Gosh, what do you mean?

146
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,806
Look who's talking.

147
00:09:43,128 --> 00:09:47,085
You must be going in early tomorrow.
Is that why you're washing your hair now?

148
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,236
Yes. Why are you home so late?

149
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,446
Seo Woo showed up and
was being such a nuisance.

150
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:54,706
I guess something bad happened
because she drank a lot.

151
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:57,086
Hey, I'll do it for you.

152
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,758
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- No!

153
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:03,364
I was going to wash my hands anyway.
We can save soap.

154
00:10:08,168 --> 00:10:09,288
Goodness...

155
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:17,590
Make sure to dry your hair thoroughly.

156
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,884
If you don't dry it before sleeping,
it will fall out.

157
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,619
I'm sure I dried it.

158
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,781
I will be responsible for your beauty.

159
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,253
Come here.

160
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,075
All right, come here.

161
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,892
Your hair can be a sign of aging.

162
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,792
You often like to
pretend that I'm your doll.

163
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:45,138
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm rehearsing.

164
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:46,214
Once I get married...

165
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,734
I have to do these things for my husband.

166
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:56,928
You're so lucky.
Someone confessed his feelings for you.

167
00:10:57,869 --> 00:10:59,617
How far have you two gone?

168
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,486
- What is that?
- What?

169
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:07,028
Have you... have you kissed him?

170
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,013
- No!
- You did.

171
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,242
I did.

172
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:15,952
No, it was just a light kiss.

173
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:20,662
Hey, I don't need all the details.
It's making me jealous.

174
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:22,123
I'm so jealous.

175
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,776
Seriously, Teacher Hong is so funny.

176
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:29,233
Though, I understand he must be
in a rush at his age.

177
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,392
He should be in a big rush.
He should move faster.

178
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,614
Hey.

179
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:36,425
Oh you, what a relief.

180
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:40,571
I thought I might have to be old and
alone forever because of you.

181
00:11:40,571 --> 00:11:41,585
Why?

182
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:44,505
I'd feel too bad getting married
and leaving you alone.

183
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,932
You don't live the way
a person should live.

184
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,768
What's wrong with the way I live?

185
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,864
I thought you could relax
after medical school.

186
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,370
But you chose a difficult specialty.

187
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,793
I thought maybe you could
relax after that.

188
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:56,707
Being a staff surgeon was even harder.

189
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:58,165
What is that?

190
00:11:58,165 --> 00:12:00,725
I can't remember the last time you
dressed up and went out.

191
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:03,635
You've had a lot to be upset at me about
all this time, haven't you?

192
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,787
It's not that I'm upset.

193
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,744
I'm worried.

194
00:12:08,556 --> 00:12:10,133
Did you meet your dad?

195
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:14,012
No, I just saw him from afar.

196
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,897
You should get married too.

197
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:18,617
Why are you suddenly saying that?

198
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,130
Just make sure you marry Teacher Hong.

199
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,970
You like him too.

200
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,258
You were willing to throw away
everything for him.

201
00:12:26,258 --> 00:12:30,611
You know I have to achieve a goal
once I set it.

202
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:33,652
That's why I'm telling you to love.

203
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,713
Walk down the flowery path,
Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.

204
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:40,479
There are priorities in life,
Cheon Soon Hee.

205
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,379
Yes, and what is more
important than love?

206
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:47,298
You are so bad at listening, really!

207
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,197
Come here.

208
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,966
<i>[Surgery Records]</i>

209
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:07,562
Okay, I won't ride in your car today.

210
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:20,158
What is this? Playing hard to get?

211
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,918
Doctor!

212
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:34,945
Can I turn on some music?
It's a bit awkward.

213
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,336
It's up to you.

214
00:14:44,946 --> 00:14:49,874
If I read this,
it won't be awkward not to talk.

215
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:53,133
That's not right.

216
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,822
You're studying and I'm driving.
That doesn't seem right.

217
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:58,984
Let's turn on the news instead.

218
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:02,311
<i>Large hospitals are
in urgent need of money</i>

219
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,603
<i>and are now turning to stock markets.</i>

220
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,700
<i>Reporter Lee Dae Hyun.</i>

221
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,677
<i>Major hospitals in Seoul are now...</i>

222
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:10,643
Looks like things will be noisy.

223
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:14,648
You should just study.
I think that'll be better than the news.

224
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,718
I absolutely hate politics.

225
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,297
They make issues out of nothing
because they have nothing to do.

226
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:24,716
We can't let these issues created from
nothing violate our lives, though.

227
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:27,773
That's a political issue.

228
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:29,023
It's reality.

229
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:37,034
Director, is it true that
the hospital invested in stocks?

230
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,205
A hospital is not a business.
You received incorrect information.

231
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,486
Do you not hold those stocks?

232
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,488
We will put out a
press release later on.

233
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,611
Director! Sir!

234
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,624
- Doctor?
- Yes.

235
00:15:54,624 --> 00:15:57,071
It's a busy morning with this news item.

236
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:59,370
Dad says not to worry,
but is it really okay?

237
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,790
How could it be okay?
The war is starting now.

238
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,109
Have you eaten yet?

239
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,080
Anyway, you have to face this thing now.

240
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,811
I'm a doctor.

241
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:12,639
My job is to treat patients and
that's what I'm best at.

242
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,710
You should deal with the politics
and I'll just support you.

243
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,830
This is an implicit
understanding between us.

244
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,445
Why are you being so serious?

245
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,041
I'm trying to give you a task
that you're good at.

246
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,468
Lee Soo Jung, the gold medalist for
archery in the 2011 London Olympics.

247
00:16:27,468 --> 00:16:28,516
Do you know her?

248
00:16:29,257 --> 00:16:30,980
<i>Yes, I was a fan.</i>

249
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,959
<i>Is she still doing archery?</i>

250
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,635
<i>She got punished for drinking
before a match, right?</i>

251
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,643
She's been suspended from
representing Korea for two years.

252
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:48,416
Then she can't go to the Olympics.

253
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,451
Do you think the hand trembling is
a sign of alcoholism?

254
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:54,974
I would have to examine her to know,
but it looks like an action tremor.

255
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:58,808
There are so many different reasons
why hands could tremble.

256
00:16:58,808 --> 00:17:00,521
It isn't so easy to diagnose.

257
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:03,365
I want you to take care of Lee Soo Jung.

258
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,453
She visited many hospitals.

259
00:17:05,453 --> 00:17:07,903
She's quietly looking for
a doctor to help her out.

260
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,126
I have no problem with that.

261
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:12,373
What does Lee Soo Jung have to do
with my dad's problem?

262
00:17:13,513 --> 00:17:17,872
After I was berated by Jin Myung Hoon,
I got angry and learned a lesson.

263
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:19,769
Jin Myung Hoon is doing well.

264
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:21,176
Oh, Doctor...

265
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:24,513
So, I got the motivation
to fight and win.

266
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,938
Jin Myung Hoon's good management sense
is also a good sense of reality.

267
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:30,520
If I become the hospital director and
we continue to see losses

268
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,474
the hospital will eventually close.

269
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:36,224
Then who would listen to
what I have to say?

270
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:37,782
You've changed a lot.

271
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:40,135
To put it another way,
you must feel very troubled.

272
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:43,419
But, I'm glad that you've changed.
I like power now.

273
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:47,404
I'm so glad to have you back.
I have someone to talk to now.

274
00:17:48,158 --> 00:17:52,638
So, my plan is for you to treat
Lee Soo Jung and get your name known.

275
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:56,860
Your name will be a source of strength.
That strength will be helpful to us.

276
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:03,105
<i>[Jin Myung Hoon]</i>

277
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:05,928
Let's go.

278
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,098
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

279
00:18:10,888 --> 00:18:12,407
It's another meeting.

280
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:13,954
He's always calling me.

281
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:15,988
He doesn't like me but always calls.
Isn't that weird?

282
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:17,606
What if I can't treat Lee Soo Jung?

283
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:21,002
Oh, please don't
say that to me, Ji Hong.

284
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,265
I'll pay.

285
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:27,882
Anyway, I'm depending on you.

286
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:31,445
The amount of strength you get
will determine what we do.

287
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,635
Are you getting old?
Stop repeating yourself.

288
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:36,070
That's how important it is.

289
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,264
You've reached your credit limit.

290
00:18:39,534 --> 00:18:41,044
There's no way.

291
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,670
Hey, do you see? Look!

292
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,561
Our revenue went down a bit last month.

293
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:48,802
They lowered the credit limit
on my corporate credit card.

294
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,278
I'll pay for it.

295
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:57,399
It's been 90 days since the surgery
and the patient is in a mental stupor.

296
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,389
The films are normal.

297
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,849
<i>Doctor, I'm returning your message now.</i>

298
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:03,936
<i>Thank you.</i>

299
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:05,730
What? This is it?

300
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,743
What is it?

301
00:19:07,472 --> 00:19:10,101
He went into a drowsy stupor
not long ago...

302
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,820
Doctor Yoo Hye Jung!

303
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,113
Goodbye...

304
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:17,684
Isn't this too much?
You're just going to send me a text?

305
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:21,334
You left me a voicemail,
so I left you a text message.

306
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,564
Is something wrong with that?

307
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:24,814
It's not that it's wrong,
but it's not very grateful.

308
00:19:24,814 --> 00:19:27,754
You gave your patient to another doctor.
How can you have no sincerity?

309
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:32,964
Doctor Yoo!

310
00:19:34,322 --> 00:19:35,859
I don't think they're going to fight.

311
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,631
You don't know what Yoon Knife is like.

312
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,805
Yoon Knife will suddenly lose it.

313
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,639
- Like this?
- You scared me, you crazy punk.

314
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,083
My head...

315
00:19:49,234 --> 00:19:50,278
Where are you going?

316
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,751
To Professor Hong Ji Hong's lab.
What about you?

317
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:56,663
Me? I'm going up to my lab too.

318
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,786
Why did you change your mind?

319
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:01,936
You said you wouldn't
take on that patient.

320
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,344
Of course, I am thankful.

321
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:04,727
I heard that she's family.

322
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:07,375
It would have been simple if you told me.
Why make it harder?

323
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,387
It isn't so simple to me.

324
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:12,956
I've had stepmothers too.
Not just one, but two.

325
00:20:12,956 --> 00:20:15,827
I have no interest in
either of them, of course.

326
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:18,250
She's only your legal mother,
so why let it bother you?

327
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,796
You haven't been mistreated, have you?

328
00:20:21,726 --> 00:20:24,067
- Oh, it's just coming at me again.
- What?

329
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:27,965
You should wait until I'm ready.

330
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:31,466
You just keep coming at me.
I'm taken aback.

331
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,051
What are you talking about?

332
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,013
It's just something...

333
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:48,577
I'll be seeing patient Lee Ga Jin today.

334
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:51,536
I'll try to book her surgery date
as soon as possible.

335
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,779
Okay.

336
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,206
Is that all you have to say?

337
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,107
If someone is showing you goodwill,
shouldn't you show some back?

338
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:03,148
What kind of curt response is that?

339
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:05,781
I don't feel bad for that person.

340
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,109
I don't wish for her
to get better either.

341
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:11,696
I couldn't resolve those feelings and
that's why I wanted you to take over.

342
00:21:12,096 --> 00:21:13,877
It's a low point as a doctor.

343
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,888
The only thing that
makes me feel better

344
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,873
is that she's still
the same awful person.

345
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,500
Still, it doesn't change the fact that
I'm at my lowest point as a doctor.

346
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,264
That's why it's not so simple.

347
00:21:26,264 --> 00:21:29,193
Is this a response that satisfies you?

348
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,882
Well, I suppose...

349
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,269
I'm on my way!

350
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:43,435
What... what are you doing?

351
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,318
Who is protecting whom?
I should be doing this.

352
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:48,092
Yoon Do!

353
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,830
Gosh, that kid.

354
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:07,582
Hey, Yoon...

355
00:22:09,772 --> 00:22:10,962
Hello.

356
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:15,153
- You look more beautiful every time--
- Be quiet and come inside.

357
00:22:15,153 --> 00:22:17,194
- Hey, hey.
- You come in too.

358
00:22:18,924 --> 00:22:20,925
What about me?

359
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,023
What about you?

360
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:23,754
Shouldn't I go in?

361
00:22:23,754 --> 00:22:25,892
Why would you come in?
We have something to discuss.

362
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:28,723
- Just you guys?
- Yes, just us.

363
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:35,420
Gosh, they shouldn't
have cliques like that.

364
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:37,683
"Just us"? Whatever.

365
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,917
<i>[Kang Kyung Joon]</i>

366
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:42,735
Yeah.

367
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:46,260
Oh, it's time for me
to see out-patients.

368
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,534
I'll be there.

369
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:51,622
I'm so busy.

370
00:23:03,937 --> 00:23:05,953
There's not much in these records.

371
00:23:05,953 --> 00:23:07,683
What do you mean by that?

372
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:11,142
Do you mean there were no issues or
that you can't tell by looking at this?

373
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,167
The latter.

374
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,368
The surgery procedure records are
not detailed and only show the results.

375
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:18,289
Cut the abdomen, died of heart failure
during removal of tumor.

376
00:23:18,289 --> 00:23:19,319
The end.

377
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:21,844
So, we can't find out
what really happened

378
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:24,369
in the operating room with these files.

379
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,646
But there are original scans
of the surgery notes.

380
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:29,146
Doesn't that mean things went okay?

381
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:33,351
You can make it appear like
nothing's wrong if you want to.

382
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,294
You can hide it when you
make the initial notes.

383
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:38,218
If I really want to know what happened--

384
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:39,699
Anesthesia records.

385
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,815
Isn't that what we need?

386
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,150
Bingo! You couldn't find the
anesthesia files?

387
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,369
That's what was missing.
This was everything on the patient.

388
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:49,050
Then that's the end of that.

389
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,189
The records for anesthesia could be
saved in the medical records department.

390
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:57,208
The surgery wasn't done here at
headquarters, so would they have it?

391
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,551
- I know.
- What do you know?

392
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,050
It's probably at that local branch
hospital since that's where they did it.

393
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,714
I think I can get it from the
records department at that branch.

394
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:16,968
I'll talk to that medical records
department for you.

395
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:18,859
You've done enough now.

396
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,704
I understand that you want to help,
but this is my homework.

397
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:27,080
It's something I have to do by myself,
like writing my journal.

398
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,059
Aren't you supposed to be
seeing out-patients?

399
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:31,577
How did you know my schedule?
Did you look it up?

400
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:36,407
I'm your fellow who's
getting trained by you.

401
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:37,552
Of course, I should know.

402
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,321
I got excited for no reason.

403
00:24:44,264 --> 00:24:46,175
I got excited for nothing!

404
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:54,791
Excuse me.

405
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:59,074
When can I get my surgery?

406
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:03,176
Most people have to wait six months
to get surgery from me.

407
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,876
As a favor to Doctor Yoo Hye Jung,
I'll do it for you earlier.

408
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:09,795
Doctor, will I be able to get better?

409
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:10,975
You can go now.

410
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:16,417
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- Thank you.

411
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,907
Please sit.

412
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,113
Are you here alone?

413
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,443
Yes.

414
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:37,225
My parents are suffering more than I am.

415
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:39,326
I don't want them to get their hopes up.

416
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:41,646
When did the trembling start?

417
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:44,006
It started last year
and has continued since.

418
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:48,975
At first, my hand would stop trembling
whenever I drank alcohol.

419
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:51,446
So, I drank before a competition.

420
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:54,846
After that... everything was ruined.

421
00:25:55,365 --> 00:25:57,694
And alcohol? Are you still drinking?

422
00:25:57,694 --> 00:26:00,891
I'm not that weak of a person, Doctor.

423
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,693
I'm from a wealthy family.
I've worked hard my entire life.

424
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:06,561
I've made it this far
by working hard, but now...

425
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,730
Can you fix it?

426
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:22,113
I'm willing try anything to stop
my hand from trembling.

427
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,307
Why don't we do some tests for now?

428
00:26:24,307 --> 00:26:27,969
There could be many reasons for
the tremor in your hand.

429
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,183
It's difficult to diagnose.

430
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,667
Forget it, then.

431
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,808
Even doctors who promised they'd fix it
couldn't fix it for me.

432
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:41,733
I don't want to trust a doctor who
doesn't have the confidence to do it.

433
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,897
You're too impatient.

434
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,080
You make quick judgments too.

435
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,790
You weren't like that before, right?

436
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,000
Back when you won the
gold medal in the Olympics?

437
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:54,063
You can trust me because I'm not sure.

438
00:26:54,732 --> 00:26:58,802
People who are good at what they do
will always doubt and question.

439
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:00,933
That way, they won't make mistakes.

440
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:09,080
You will have to get many tests done
before the surgery.

441
00:27:09,578 --> 00:27:12,186
Blood tests, stool tests...
we have to do them all.

442
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:14,427
You have to do them within
one month of the surgery.

443
00:27:14,427 --> 00:27:17,177
You should get them done again
a month after surgery, as well.

444
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,487
Are you saying I have to wait
one month to get the surgery?

445
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,789
But, Yoo Hye Jung is my daughter.

446
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:26,128
Ma'am, you are so impatient.

447
00:27:26,128 --> 00:27:28,429
I was just telling you
how things normally work.

448
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,859
Since you're Doctor Yoo Hye Jung's mother

449
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,859
you're totally a VIP.

450
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,589
You can get surgery in two days.

451
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,399
That's Doctor Jung Yoon Do's
favor to you.

452
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,978
Is Hye Jung really that great?

453
00:27:38,978 --> 00:27:40,693
She's the best.

454
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,843
What good is that?
She should be a good human being.

455
00:27:42,843 --> 00:27:45,763
Her mother is here and
she isn't even showing up.

456
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:49,023
I'm letting it go
because I am her mother.

457
00:27:49,023 --> 00:27:51,673
If I told people how she was
when she was younger

458
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:54,355
does she think she'd be able to work
or live out in society?

459
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,894
Mom.

460
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:58,456
When should we do the tests?

461
00:27:58,456 --> 00:28:00,251
You can do them today since you're here.

462
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:03,971
Do family members
get discounts on just surgery

463
00:28:03,971 --> 00:28:06,994
or on medical exams, as well?

464
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:09,716
- You get it on medical exams, as well.
- Then why didn't I get it?

465
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:12,958
Doctor Yoo needs to
submit the documents to HR

466
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,646
and tell them the dates of your visit.

467
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:17,129
It's just one thing after another.

468
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,745
There are no free things in life.

469
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,755
How will I stand having her
hold that against me?

470
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:27,421
- Doctor?
- Yes.

471
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:32,481
Can you give me my sister's number?

472
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:34,821
My dad wants to see her.

473
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,404
What do you think it is?

474
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:46,587
She's not even 30 yet,
so it doesn't seem degenerative.

475
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:48,498
Is it a resting tremor or action tremor?

476
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,593
Action tremor?

477
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,876
Intention or essential?

478
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:54,635
At first, it was intention that only
happened when she did archery.

479
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:56,732
Now, it happens all the time,
except in her sleep.

480
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,478
What are the causes for an
intention tremor and essential tremor?

481
00:28:59,478 --> 00:29:02,583
An intention tremor occurs usually when
there is something wrong with the hand.

482
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:05,086
With essential tremors,
the causes are unknown.

483
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:06,647
Treatment?

484
00:29:06,647 --> 00:29:08,676
Drug therapy is most common.

485
00:29:08,676 --> 00:29:10,820
Propranolol or primidone.

486
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,265
Give a neurosurgeon's answer.

487
00:29:14,205 --> 00:29:16,752
- DBS?
- That's right.

488
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,548
- You're going to do an awake surgery?
- Yes.

489
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,667
And I'm going to assist you?

490
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:25,007
Of course.

491
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:26,521
Oh, I'm so happy!

492
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:29,715
I've never done an awake surgery before.

493
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,223
I've seen videos and I've thought about
the day I might finally do one.

494
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:36,492
It's finally coming.
Thank you, Doctor!

495
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,506
- So, this is what you like.
- Yes!

496
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:51,204
Gosh, Doctor...

497
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:55,783
Yes!

498
00:29:58,351 --> 00:29:59,990
What are you so happy about?

499
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,748
Have you done a DBS,
awake surgery before?

500
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:04,218
No, I wouldn't have, obviously.

501
00:30:04,218 --> 00:30:07,289
Even in a big hospital like Gookil,
you haven't had that chance?

502
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:09,217
It's so obvious that
you're a small town girl.

503
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:11,458
A fellow can't do a surgery like that.

504
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,759
You're not doing one, are you?

505
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,776
Doctor Hong is doing it
and I'm assisting.

506
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:21,846
Yes!

507
00:30:33,715 --> 00:30:34,911
Come in.

508
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:39,904
Hi. Have you eaten?

509
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:45,177
I want to do the Lee Soo Jung surgery.

510
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:48,061
You said you wanted to work with
Doctor Jung Yoon Do.

511
00:30:48,061 --> 00:30:49,487
I changed my mind.

512
00:30:49,954 --> 00:30:53,350
Just because you change your mind,
it doesn't change anything.

513
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,606
It's not fair.

514
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:57,034
You're giving better opportunities
to the woman you like.

515
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:59,784
- Hey...
- Let me in on it, then.

516
00:31:00,685 --> 00:31:05,416
Gosh, this isn't something
I can decide on my own.

517
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,084
Then, let's hold a meeting.

518
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:13,109
We are all here because
Doctor Jin Seo Woo has an objection.

519
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:15,375
I want to learn from
Professor Hong Ji Hong.

520
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,976
Okay, I'll go with Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.

521
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:24,049
So, it's enough for
the two of you to agree?

522
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,928
Honestly, Jin Seo Woo and I
have been together for a very long time

523
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:28,369
so change is good.

524
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:31,097
- What do you mean "Change is good"?
- You wanted to switch first.

525
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,456
Do you have to put it that way?

526
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:35,016
Stop it. Are you in high school
or something?

527
00:31:35,016 --> 00:31:36,958
What do you think, Doctor Yoo Hye Jung?

528
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,467
I received an offer from you
and I accepted.

529
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:41,013
I don't want to change that.

530
00:31:41,013 --> 00:31:45,936
Doctor Yoo Hye Jung, you are very good
at operating on aneurysms for a fellow.

531
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:47,384
It made me want to work with you.

532
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:50,213
We should work together.
You will learn a lot from me.

533
00:31:50,974 --> 00:31:53,058
To summarize,
Jin Seo Woo and Yoo Hye Jung

534
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:54,267
want to work with Hong Ji Hong.

535
00:31:54,267 --> 00:31:57,583
Hong Ji Hong wants Yoo Hye Jung and
Yoo Hye Jung wants Hong Ji Hong too.

536
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,330
There is no other match, so Hong Ji Hong
and Yoo Hye Jung will be a team.

537
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:05,859
Then let me in on this surgery, at least.

538
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:08,480
What do you think, Doctor Jung?

539
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,100
Since she wants to do it so much,
let her do so.

540
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,502
In return, the fellows can be
passed back and forth

541
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,370
to be trained on different cases.

542
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,411
Passed back and forth?
What a cheap way to talk.

543
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:25,170
Why are you getting angry
at everything I say?

544
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,582
So, let's summarize again.

545
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,390
I will accept
Doctor Jung Yoon Do's proposal.

546
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,917
We will train the fellows
based on the situation.

547
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,292
Are you okay with that?

548
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:40,521
Do you still not get it?

549
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,981
- What?
- Can't you see they like each other?

550
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:46,991
That's them liking each other?

551
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:49,091
I'm sure they're close
since he was her teacher.

552
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:50,792
He's known her since she was young.

553
00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:53,196
- You should go through it too.
- What?

554
00:32:53,196 --> 00:32:56,540
The pain of seeing the person you like
looking at someone else.

555
00:32:57,284 --> 00:32:58,323
You know me.

556
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:02,049
I can maintain love,
but I'm great at starting it.

557
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,503
I haven't even started yet.

558
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,562
If there's a competitor,
I feel even more motivated.

559
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:08,822
Yeah, me too.

560
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,753
I don't know about anyone else,
but I'll never let you go to Hye Jung.

561
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:14,023
I'll lose to her once, but not twice.

562
00:33:14,023 --> 00:33:16,459
Hey, why are you acting like this to me?

563
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:19,884
I waited for you for this long
and this is how you repay me?

564
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:23,602
I will get you no matter what I do.
You'd better prepare for it.

565
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,953
Why is she acting like that? It's scary.

566
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,526
Oh, we're not open yet...

567
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:42,379
Are you disappointed?
I turned up in this state.

568
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:46,235
Did you pretend not to know me
even though you knew?

569
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:49,447
No, I didn't recognize you
because you got so pretty.

570
00:33:49,996 --> 00:33:52,304
You're all doing so well.

571
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:55,937
I hear Hye Jung is the most successful.
Is she really a doctor?

572
00:33:55,937 --> 00:33:58,090
Yes, she was always smart.

573
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,850
I guess she always read books,
even while rebelling.

574
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,020
She's a really smart girl.

575
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,295
I came to say goodbye.

576
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,485
- I won't be delivering beer anymore.
- Why?

577
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,029
I got fired this morning.

578
00:34:11,029 --> 00:34:14,583
I heard about you guys, felt ashamed,
got drunk, and made a mess of things.

579
00:34:15,494 --> 00:34:18,368
You must be a bad drunk. Oh no!

580
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:20,402
Wow, you must have a lot of money.

581
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:22,286
How much do you need
for a place like this?

582
00:34:22,286 --> 00:34:25,118
I told Hye Jung about you.

583
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:26,259
What did she say?

584
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:31,208
Do you still like Hye Jung?
You followed her around a lot back then.

585
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:34,844
Hey, did she say that?
Did she say I followed her around?

586
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,795
Anyway, don't hang around her.

587
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,734
She's going through a lot right now.

588
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:44,266
Why? Is she embarrassed of me?
I should just throw this right over!

589
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,522
President Jung, it's been a long time.

590
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:03,965
I was glad to hear you'd be coming.

591
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:05,967
That's why I made time today.

592
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,217
Old friends are the best kind.

593
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,929
How have you all been?

594
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,406
Congressman Na, you look good.

595
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:19,181
Gosh, I think my liver is failing.
I'm so tired.

596
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:20,353
You should drink less.

597
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:30,592
When we first started this,
we wondered if it would be possible.

598
00:35:30,592 --> 00:35:34,743
People eventually end up on
the side that makes them money.

599
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:39,444
This is the way this generation
is moving, President.

600
00:35:39,444 --> 00:35:42,342
Congressman Na is an expert on
how this generation thinks.

601
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,335
These days, politics are similar
to being a celebrity.

602
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:47,732
Once you lose your popularity,
you lose all support.

603
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:49,964
Oh, stop your complaining now.

604
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:52,404
No one has to look over their shoulders
as much as hospitals.

605
00:35:52,404 --> 00:35:55,255
We even have to pretend
that we are kind.

606
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,467
Once hospitals become private companies

607
00:35:57,467 --> 00:36:00,917
what will Director Jin
complain about then?

608
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:05,027
If that happens, no more complaints.
Only happiness!

609
00:36:10,685 --> 00:36:14,878
Well... we are trying.

610
00:36:14,878 --> 00:36:16,225
The public is the problem.

611
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:18,344
Don't worry. It will happen.

612
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:21,447
We will pass the new revision
to the health bill.

613
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:25,165
They said Jeju Island's private hospital
wouldn't happen, and it did.

614
00:36:25,165 --> 00:36:28,203
You are all truly the best.

615
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:29,755
I feel very supported.

616
00:36:30,744 --> 00:36:34,623
What's going on with Board Director Hong?

617
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,436
You don't need to worry.
I'll take care of him.

618
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,967
Today, let's go all the way!

619
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:44,058
Yes, let's do that!

620
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:56,268
Where is the
Neurosurgery Department here?

621
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,476
- How do you feel?
- Good.

622
00:37:05,476 --> 00:37:08,650
The surgery went well
and there are no issues yet.

623
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:11,219
- You can be discharged tomorrow.
- Thank you.

624
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,290
When can I take a shower?

625
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,460
It's best to wait one day
after being discharged.

626
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,364
I'm dying to shower.

627
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,891
- I guess it hasn't arrived yet.
- What?

628
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:27,049
I thought I would be discharged tomorrow,
so I prepared a present.

629
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:29,982
- Is it a rice cake?
- Yes!

630
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:32,295
Everyone's eating it
at the nurse's station.

631
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:34,020
You should go out and eat it.

632
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,514
It's made with special rice grain,
so it's really good.

633
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,496
Yes, I'll make sure to eat it.

634
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,511
Wow, I've never had a cake
made out of rice before.

635
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,411
It's really good.

636
00:37:45,411 --> 00:37:46,996
Leave some for Chief Kyung Joon.

637
00:37:46,996 --> 00:37:49,054
He'll be like...
"Where's mine!"

638
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:52,513
Should we give some to
the staff surgeons too?

639
00:37:52,513 --> 00:37:55,326
I'll give some to Chief Kyung Joon.

640
00:37:55,326 --> 00:37:57,793
You have a really good personality.

641
00:37:57,793 --> 00:37:59,165
He hits you all the time.

642
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:00,940
He has no clue that he's an outcast.

643
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,101
I pity him.

644
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:06,090
Go on, then.

645
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:09,699
- Are the professors still around?
- Yes.

646
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:14,170
Professor Hong is here and
Professor Jung is in the ICU.

647
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:17,898
Is Yoo Hye Jung around, by chance?

648
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:22,130
What is this about?

649
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:25,127
I don't think I need to tell you that.

650
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,359
Is she here?

651
00:38:30,672 --> 00:38:32,199
She's not here.

652
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,360
If you leave me your number,
I'll call you when she comes.

653
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,625
That means she is coming. I'll wait.

654
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:43,221
What's going on?
Call Doctor Yoo and tell her not to come.

655
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:44,440
Call her now.

656
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:48,067
It's too late.

657
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:54,509
Doctor, eat this.

658
00:38:54,949 --> 00:38:56,824
- Hey.
- Yes?

659
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:01,616
Oh, this is good.

660
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:04,406
Do you even know who bought this cake?

661
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,545
What are you doing?

662
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,377
Well... Doctor.

663
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:12,639
You're in my way. Move.

664
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,404
Okay.

665
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:29,366
Do you know him?

666
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,703
Yes, he's my friend.

667
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,902
What is this? What's going on?
What brings you by?

668
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,746
You're not embarrassed of me?

669
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,212
Why would I be? We're friends.

670
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,826
I heard about you from Soon Hee

671
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:44,627
but I'm so busy
and don't have any days off.

672
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:48,473
I'm sure you're busy being a doctor
in a big hospital like this.

673
00:39:49,355 --> 00:39:51,643
- You've gotten better looking.
- Really?

674
00:39:52,322 --> 00:39:53,324
You have facial hair.

675
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,476
You look like Wolverine! Wolverine.

676
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,866
Wolverine, no.

677
00:39:58,422 --> 00:40:00,409
Why is that kid here?

678
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,487
Do you know him?

679
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:05,288
How would I know that?

680
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,496
Why are you getting mad at me?

681
00:40:07,496 --> 00:40:10,009
Aren't you acting too friendly with me?

682
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:11,299
Well, can't I?

683
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:14,391
You can.

684
00:40:15,922 --> 00:40:17,708
Let's go somewhere else and talk.

685
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:26,630
How have you been?

686
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,860
Not that well.

687
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,648
Then I heard about you and
it really made me think.

688
00:40:31,648 --> 00:40:33,886
I thought to myself that
Hye Jung actually did it.

689
00:40:33,886 --> 00:40:35,580
I did do it.

690
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,128
Thank you for being good to me
when things were tough.

691
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,415
I never did anything for you.

692
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,181
Let's see each other often now.
I'll buy drinks.

693
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,889
Thanks.

694
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,121
I thought you might pretend
not to know me

695
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:52,868
now that you're so successful.

696
00:40:53,587 --> 00:40:55,880
What's wrong with you,
Kim Soo Chul?

697
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,514
What happened to that
"live or die" attitude you used to have?

698
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:04,793
I came to say farewell.

699
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:07,782
I guess it's a farewell
as soon as we met up again.

700
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:09,214
Are you going somewhere?

701
00:41:09,214 --> 00:41:11,031
I'm going to where my son is.

702
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:13,203
Son? Are you married?

703
00:41:13,203 --> 00:41:14,433
I'm divorced.

704
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:19,143
Hey, do you want to see him?
He looks like me, so he's good looking.

705
00:41:19,634 --> 00:41:20,824
Show me.

706
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:25,199
Who's raising your son?

707
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,598
His mom.

708
00:41:27,449 --> 00:41:29,118
I have to send her money.

709
00:41:31,382 --> 00:41:33,159
Oh, he's so cute!

710
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,835
Right, he's so cute?
He looks just like me.

711
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:42,246
I'm going to work really hard now too.

712
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:45,855
Seeing how your life turned out,
I think I can make it work too.

713
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:47,096
Is it too late?

714
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:51,105
It's never too late.
You're still a strong and cool guy.

715
00:41:51,565 --> 00:41:53,715
This is what I wanted to hear from you.

716
00:41:54,775 --> 00:41:56,846
I think I can do it now.

717
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,985
Ah, do you still ride a motorcycle?

718
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:03,324
Every now and then.

719
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,284
You were so cool on your motorcycle.

720
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:07,813
I wish I could see it again.

721
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,177
Hold on.

722
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,665
- Hello.
- <i>It's Dad.</i>

723
00:42:19,134 --> 00:42:20,143
Excuse me?

724
00:42:21,014 --> 00:42:22,438
I said it's Dad.

725
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:25,040
What's wrong?

726
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:30,826
Where are you right now? Let's meet.

727
00:42:31,511 --> 00:42:32,960
All right.

728
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,810
I'm sorry but I think I have to go.

729
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:42,067
You have to see me before you leave.

730
00:42:42,067 --> 00:42:43,208
You have to.

731
00:42:43,208 --> 00:42:45,241
Okay, let's get up.

732
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:07,264
This is where your grandma is.

733
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:10,494
Why did you move her?

734
00:43:10,494 --> 00:43:12,723
The 10 year contract ended.

735
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:15,712
I wanted to move her to a better place.

736
00:43:26,953 --> 00:43:28,449
You look like you've been good.

737
00:43:34,172 --> 00:43:36,350
I've been running a restaurant.

738
00:43:36,728 --> 00:43:37,819
Granny's Rice Soup.

739
00:43:38,527 --> 00:43:42,799
I got your grandma's cooking skills,
though I didn't know it before.

740
00:43:43,598 --> 00:43:46,679
The restaurant is doing pretty well
and we're okay.

741
00:43:47,888 --> 00:43:49,388
You should come by.

742
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:53,118
Yes, you should come with the
hospital people.

743
00:43:53,118 --> 00:43:55,516
I'll treat you all.

744
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:00,674
I'll get going now.

745
00:44:00,915 --> 00:44:04,536
Why... you still have tea left.

746
00:44:04,536 --> 00:44:07,297
I'm an adult who no longer
needs my parents.

747
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:08,473
Hye Jung.

748
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:11,179
You can't live like that.

749
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:15,078
How can you live happily with
a grudge against your dad?

750
00:44:15,078 --> 00:44:16,226
Don't worry.

751
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:17,806
I don't hold a grudge against you.

752
00:44:18,627 --> 00:44:22,246
Just like I said, I'm no longer young,
so I don't need you.

753
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:24,587
I'm used to living on my own.

754
00:44:25,485 --> 00:44:27,565
Let's live apart like we've been doing.

755
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:30,196
Who will walk you down the aisle
when you get married?

756
00:44:30,196 --> 00:44:32,446
You need your dad.

757
00:44:33,886 --> 00:44:37,917
Because I might need you,
I decided not to get married.

758
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:23,502
- Hello.
- Oh Cho Ah, you're here.

759
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:25,650
Okay, let's start in five minutes.

760
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:31,013
Come in. Sit down.

761
00:45:35,705 --> 00:45:36,947
All right...

762
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:41,424
I'm going to give you your diagnosis
for your illness.

763
00:45:41,424 --> 00:45:43,596
You will need to make a choice on whether

764
00:45:43,596 --> 00:45:46,907
you will follow
my treatment advice or not.

765
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,712
<i>[In surgery: Lee Ga Jin, Go Ah Shin]</i>

766
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:51,766
<i>[In recovery: Choi Jung Hoon,
Jin Seo Joo]</i>

767
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:22,337
Please count down from 10.

768
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,877
Ten, nine...

769
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:30,449
eight, seven, six...

770
00:46:33,462 --> 00:46:35,469
Please intubate.

771
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:48,703
Cotton.

772
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:01,333
Dissector.

773
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:13,804
Do you see the lateral spread?

774
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:15,920
Yes, I see it.

775
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
Teflon.

776
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:35,393
Do you still see the lateral spread?

777
00:47:36,663 --> 00:47:37,708
No.

778
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,656
- Is it gone?
- Yes.

779
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,674
Teflon.

780
00:47:44,235 --> 00:47:47,996
The reason your hand shakes
is called an essential tremor.

781
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:50,935
Your hand has tremors
for no specific reason.

782
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:54,895
How can you diagnose it
without knowing the cause?

783
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:58,956
My diagnosis is that your hand
has tremors from an unknown cause.

784
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,621
The important part is the treatment.

785
00:48:01,621 --> 00:48:04,976
DBS is deep brain stimulation surgery.

786
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:06,199
Take a look.

787
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,212
We use electrical stimulation
in the brain

788
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:10,603
to find the area that stops the tremors.

789
00:48:10,627 --> 00:48:13,179
We keep you awake for the surgery.

790
00:48:13,179 --> 00:48:15,869
You will be conscious for the surgery.

791
00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:18,962
I think I've seen it in a movie.

792
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:21,737
Doesn't it hurt?

793
00:48:21,737 --> 00:48:24,828
Not at all. The brain doesn't feel pain.

794
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:28,348
We will provide anesthesia
when we open up the skull.

795
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:33,328
What if you stimulate the brain,
but the tremor doesn't go away?

796
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,226
Could that happen?

797
00:48:35,226 --> 00:48:37,380
Yes, that could happen.

798
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,835
Side effects include paralysis, coma,
hemorrhage, and seizures.

799
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:46,179
You could also end up with
temporary damage to your nerves.

800
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,739
Well, what is the success rate?

801
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:53,310
About 90 percent.

802
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:56,491
- Really?
- Yes.

803
00:48:57,279 --> 00:48:59,253
- Thank you.
- Oh no.

804
00:48:59,253 --> 00:49:03,853
Please don't thank me until you win
at the Asian Games of Tokyo Olympics.

805
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:07,422
- So, I can continue with archery?
- Of course.

806
00:49:09,411 --> 00:49:13,572
Is it possible to take a video of
my surgery and put it online?

807
00:49:14,721 --> 00:49:15,772
Why?

808
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:18,502
I want to restore my honor.

809
00:49:18,502 --> 00:49:22,183
I didn't have a tremor
because I was an alcoholic.

810
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:25,784
I was trying to be a great athlete
even with an illness like this.

811
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:31,636
Even if this surgery fails...
I want to show people I tried my best.

812
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:35,226
I'm rooting for you, Lee Soo Jung.
I'll do whatever you wish.

813
00:49:46,578 --> 00:49:48,078
Come in.

814
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:50,973
Oh, Doctor.

815
00:49:59,051 --> 00:50:03,154
You may not be curious,
but the surgery went very well.

816
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:05,833
Oh, thank you.

817
00:50:05,833 --> 00:50:07,969
- Are you really thankful?
- Yes, of course.

818
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,442
Then, let's go for a meal together.

819
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:11,572
Okay, let's meet in the
hospital cafeteria later.

820
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:14,833
Not the cafeteria.
Isn't that being cheap?

821
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:17,272
Who says thanks by buying cafeteria food?

822
00:50:18,232 --> 00:50:21,632
Honestly, I'm not so thankful that
I want to buy you a meal.

823
00:50:22,911 --> 00:50:25,882
Then, I will buy the meal.
You can buy coffee, can't you?

824
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,322
I'm not thankful enough
to buy coffee either.

825
00:50:28,322 --> 00:50:31,014
Then I will buy the food
and coffee, okay?

826
00:50:32,212 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm sorry about both.

827
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,473
I don't think we're close enough
to go out to eat together.

828
00:50:37,473 --> 00:50:41,721
How close do we have to become
for you to eat with me?

829
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,250
People usually become closer
by eating together.

830
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:47,032
Do you not want to be close to me?

831
00:50:54,163 --> 00:50:56,252
Why did you stop talking
as soon as I walked in?

832
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:58,503
You walked in as soon as
I stopped talking.

833
00:50:58,503 --> 00:51:01,442
Then it's her turn to respond.
Why aren't you responding?

834
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:04,527
It's not that. Let's do it later.

835
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:07,621
- Do what later?
- Why are asking so many questions?

836
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:09,681
Did you get rejected after
asking to go out to eat?

837
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,902
Your methods are so old.

838
00:51:13,902 --> 00:51:16,721
Hey! Are you going to be like this?

839
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:20,891
We may be friendly,
but this is work and I'm your boss.

840
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,183
Have some etiquette.

841
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:27,920
What a joke.

842
00:51:30,831 --> 00:51:33,621
<i>Come to my office.
It's about Lee Soo Jung.</i>

843
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,509
He texted you first.

844
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,002
She's making me angrier.

845
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:48,712
I'm already holding in
my anger as it is.

846
00:51:48,712 --> 00:51:52,069
Sorry, I ran into the section chief
on my way here.

847
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:53,391
Sit down, sit down.

848
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,130
Put the box over there.

849
00:51:59,561 --> 00:52:01,962
Did you book Lee Soo Jung's surgery date?

850
00:52:01,962 --> 00:52:04,402
- Yes, tomorrow.
- That quickly?

851
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:07,663
Everything is ready to go.
I've been practicing it in my head.

852
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:16,915
<i>Honey is just dripping from their eyes,
right in front of me.</i>

853
00:52:16,915 --> 00:52:20,154
Come out early tomorrow to get ready.
Two of you are enough, right?

854
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:21,404
Yes.

855
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:31,645
<i>Just love each other blatantly,
why don't you?</i>

856
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:34,545
I'll get going, then.

857
00:52:34,545 --> 00:52:35,897
Okay.

858
00:52:40,505 --> 00:52:41,993
Aren't you going?

859
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:43,884
I'll leave in a bit.

860
00:52:43,884 --> 00:52:47,683
That's good. Help me move this box.
It's so heavy.

Seo Woo, hurry up. Come on.

862
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,607
Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you.

863
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:56,924
There's no need for that.
The surgery went well, so don't worry.

864
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,042
Yes, we heard from Doctor Jung Yoon Do.

865
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:04,857
He said he inserted some material
between the artery and nerve.

866
00:53:04,857 --> 00:53:07,034
It must be because you're
Doctor Yoo's father.

867
00:53:07,034 --> 00:53:10,473
You understand things very quickly
and speak eloquently.

868
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,058
Ah, there's Doctor Yoo now.

869
00:53:16,288 --> 00:53:19,288
Thanks to you, the surgery went great.

870
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:23,201
Yes. Did you do the dressing on
Hwang Jung Hwa?

871
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,877
- Yes.
- Let's check on her.

872

Yes.

873
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:40,714
Is there anything to eat?

874
00:53:40,714 --> 00:53:43,878
There's still some rice cake left.
Do you want some?

875
00:53:43,878 --> 00:53:45,556
- Yes.
- Yes, sir!

876
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,377
- I will carry out your command.
- Stop playing around.

877
00:53:56,509 --> 00:53:59,386
- Can I sit down?
- Sit.

878
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:09,741
Dad wanted me to bring you
our family documents.

879
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,328
Sis, do you hate me too?

880
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:18,074
No, I don't have ill will towards you.

881
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:23,471
I'm so glad I have a sister.
I've been so lonely.

882
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:28,743
This may come off cold to you,
but I like things the way they are.

883

I don't want to get
mixed up with your family.

897
