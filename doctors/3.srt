3
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:14,098
<font color="yellow">The feelings associated with like and dislike...</font>

4
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,470
<font color="yellow">are produced by the amygdaloid nucleus in cerebrum.</font>

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,053
<font color="yellow">The Amygdaloid nucleus is also responsible...</font>

6
00:00:20,282 --> 00:00:22,283
<font color="yellow">for the fight-or-flight response and aggressive behaviour.</font>

7
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:28,000
<font color="yellow">Falling in love causes people...
to become simultaneously more combative.</font>

8
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,988
<font color="yellow">Hello. I tried to come on time.</font>

9
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,701
<font color="yellow">Please sit.</font>

10
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,997
<font color="yellow">- I ordered my drink already.
- Yes.</font>

11
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,372
<font color="yellow">- I'll have a soda.
- Okay.</font>

12
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:46,173
<font color="yellow">I guess you can't judge a book
by its cover.</font>

13
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:52,314
<font color="yellow">Who knew you would be caught up in
a messy scandal like this, Teacher?</font>

14
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:56,684
<font color="yellow">I believe it's basic manners to respect
the other person when conversing.</font>

15
00:00:56,684 --> 00:00:58,811
<font color="yellow">And I respect you.</font>

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,074
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo misunderstood things and
that's why there was a messy scandal.</font>

17
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:09,338
<font color="yellow">I don't want anyone to
get hurt by what happened.</font>

18
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:11,915
<font color="yellow">I'm willing to accept getting hurt.</font>

19
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:15,494
<font color="yellow">What you're saying is that
you will protect Hye Jung?</font>

20
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,823
<font color="yellow">That child will most likely be expelled.</font>

21
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:21,255
<font color="yellow">You will have to take some
responsibility for this too.</font>

22
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,288
<font color="yellow">If that's the case</font>

23
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:30,365
<font color="yellow">I will have to sue Seo Woo
and the school for defamation.</font>

24
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,936
<font color="yellow">Teacher!</font>

25
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:35,562
<font color="yellow">If this issue gets any bigger,
it won't be good for Seo Woo either.</font>

26
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,118
<font color="yellow">It won't matter if you do so.</font>

27
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,916
<font color="yellow">I cannot accept you and Hye Jung
in the same school.</font>

28
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:02,264
<font color="yellow">Teacher Hong.</font>

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,105
<font color="yellow">I really liked you.</font>

30
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:07,869
<font color="yellow">You're a doctor who became a teacher.
It's a nice title.</font>

31
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:10,654
<font color="yellow">Why throw that away?</font>

32
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:16,467
<font color="yellow">Please get the temporary English teacher
to take over my class.</font>

33
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:49,295
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

34
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,869
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do?</font>

35
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:56,659
<font color="yellow">We should go to the hospital.</font>

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,718
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

37
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:01,825
<font color="yellow">Don't tell the homeroom teacher
why we met up.</font>

38
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:06,189
<font color="yellow">He ought to know what you did
on his behalf.</font>

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,162
<font color="yellow">- Soon Hee.
- Yes?</font>

40
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,890
<font color="yellow">My friend, Soon Hee.</font>

41
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,841
<font color="yellow">I want to become a good person.</font>

42
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,641
<font color="yellow">I want to live a good life.</font>

43
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,037
<font color="yellow">I don't want our teacher to get
involved in this with me.</font>

44
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,379
<font color="yellow">Same goes for you, as well.</font>

45
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:27,044
<font color="yellow">You should run far away from me, quickly.</font>

46
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,468
<font color="yellow">Give me your parents' number
instead of your grandma's.</font>

47
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:54,498
<font color="yellow">I don't have any.</font>

48
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:57,348
<font color="yellow">She attends our school
and she's a nuisance.</font>

49
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:59,015
<font color="yellow">Arson is a crime.</font>

50
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,034
<font color="yellow">Then, what's going to happen?</font>

51
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,373
<font color="yellow">What do you think? She'll go to prison.</font>

52
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:07,634
<font color="yellow">You're over the age of 14,
so you'll get a prison sentence.</font>

53
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:09,754
<font color="yellow">Even if it was an accident?</font>

54
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:12,135
<font color="yellow">Some container of gas fell over, is all.</font>

55
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:16,135
<font color="yellow">Did that container fall over on its own?
Someone set a fire and made it fall.</font>

56
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:19,337
<font color="yellow">Can I take my daughter home now?</font>

57
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:21,125
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can take her home.</font>

58
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:22,212
<font color="yellow">What about Hye Jung?</font>

59
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,642
<font color="yellow">She has no guardian.</font>

60
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:26,253
<font color="yellow">I will have to charge her
for the crime of arson.</font>

61
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,051
<font color="yellow">No! I'll stay here with her.</font>

62
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:30,330
<font color="yellow">Stop saying nonsense. Come on.</font>

63
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:32,133
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung!</font>

64
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,827
<font color="yellow">Go home with your dad.</font>

65
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:37,195
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who started it.
I should be the one to end it.</font>

66
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,965
<font color="yellow">No, I did it. Hye Jung didn't do it!</font>

67
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:44,625
<font color="yellow">Kids this age will do anything
for their friends.</font>

68
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,253
<font color="yellow">She's still very clueless.</font>

69
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:48,863
<font color="yellow">- Let's get going!
- No, Hye Jung! Hye Jung!</font>

70
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:51,104
<font color="yellow">Dad, Dad! Hye Jung!</font>

71
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:53,409
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung! I'll be back. Dad...</font>

72
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:58,736
<font color="yellow">You must think you're cool
to take all the blame.</font>

73
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:03,275
<font color="yellow">But... the reality is that
it's like a deep ditch.</font>

74
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,075
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

75
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:22,347
<font color="yellow">Welcome to my home!</font>

76
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:25,073
<font color="yellow">Gosh, be quiet! You'll wake everyone.</font>

77
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,395
<font color="yellow">Stop barking.</font>

78
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:31,190
<font color="yellow">This second year resident with
not much to do is here to visit you.</font>

79
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,003
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

80
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,414
<font color="yellow">Why am I so happy to hear
that you quit school?</font>

81
00:05:37,414 --> 00:05:40,238
<font color="yellow">Did you quit to go to the US
with the director?</font>

82
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,032
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten yet?</font>

83
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,751
<font color="yellow">Are you going to cook for me?</font>

84
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,697
<font color="yellow">I'm going to give you
food from the fridge.</font>

85
00:05:53,697 --> 00:05:56,106
<font color="yellow">That's the same thing.</font>

86
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,036
<font color="yellow">Oh, hey!</font>

87
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,356
<font color="yellow">Be mine. I'll be good to you.</font>

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,431
<font color="yellow">Who is that? I'll kill her.</font>

89
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:10,296
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

90
00:06:10,642 --> 00:06:13,019
<font color="yellow">Teacher Hong. It's Soon Hee.</font>

91
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,489
<font color="yellow">Yeah, why are you calling so late?</font>

92
00:06:14,489 --> 00:06:17,130
<font color="yellow">Sorry, it's urgent.</font>

93
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,618
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung is at the police station.</font>

94
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,580
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

95
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,270
<font color="yellow">Hello, Doctor. Hello, ma'am.</font>

96
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,924
<font color="yellow">What, exactly, happened?</font>

97
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,875
<font color="yellow">What did Hye Jung say?</font>

98
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,452
<font color="yellow">I came to you first.</font>

99
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,322
<font color="yellow">She tried to kill me.</font>

100
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,544
<font color="yellow">- Seo Woo--
- I liked you, Teacher.</font>

101
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:05,500
<font color="yellow">I respected you.</font>

102
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:10,609
<font color="yellow">Because someone like you was there,
I actually enjoyed going to school.</font>

103
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,308
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to disappoint me?</font>

104
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,334
<font color="yellow">What did you like and
what disappointed you?</font>

105
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,489
<font color="yellow">Why can't it be me?</font>

106
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:21,940
<font color="yellow">Why is Hye Jung okay, but not me?</font>

107
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:25,161
<font color="yellow">Why do you like her and not me?</font>

108
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:30,046
<font color="yellow">You know that you're
pretty and smart, right?</font>

109
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:38,587
<font color="yellow">Rest up and get better,
both your heart and body.</font>

110
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:09,096
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung, come on out.</font>

111
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,184
<font color="yellow">Give me your arm.</font>

112
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:38,115
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

113
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,953
<font color="yellow">There you go, not listening again.</font>

114
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,768
<font color="yellow">You never did listen very well.</font>

115
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,630
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo can't be the only one injured.</font>

116
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,174
<font color="yellow">You were both in the same place.</font>

117
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:24,261
<font color="yellow">People with backgrounds like yours can
get treated unfairly by the police.</font>

118
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:35,019
<font color="yellow">Why would you want that?</font>

119
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:36,673
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

120
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:39,218
<font color="yellow">You are an odd one.</font>

121
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,049
<font color="yellow">Sign it for me.</font>

122
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:55,855
<font color="yellow">Lee Ji Hong? Hong Ji Hong?</font>

123
00:09:55,855 --> 00:09:59,808
<font color="yellow">Oh, that? I was an orphan
until junior high.</font>

124
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,698
<font color="yellow">What's that look?</font>

125
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,500
<font color="yellow">Do I suddenly look pitiful to you?</font>

126
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,370
<font color="yellow">Ah, so that's how people feel
when they look at me.</font>

127
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,121
<font color="yellow">When I tell them I don't have a mom...</font>

128
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:22,044
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

129
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,303
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at you because
I have nowhere else to look.</font>

130
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,848
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo's okay. I just saw her.</font>

131
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

132
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:02,346
<font color="yellow">I've been avoiding you since
that post went online.</font>

133
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:04,409
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

134
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:07,855
<font color="yellow">It's just so strange, you and I...</font>

135
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:14,737
<font color="yellow">I didn't imagine it could be possible.</font>

136
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:23,942
<font color="yellow">I heard that you resigned
because of me--</font>

137
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:26,668
<font color="yellow">Teacher and student. Woman and man.</font>

138
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:31,183
<font color="yellow">In a society like ours,
who would end up suffering more?</font>

139
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:36,553
<font color="yellow">So, why am I more worried about you?</font>

140
00:11:50,783 --> 00:11:51,871
<font color="yellow">Teacher.</font>

141
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,622
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

142
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:58,900
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly doing this?</font>

143
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,351
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling I might not
see you anymore.</font>

144
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,952
<font color="yellow">Don't come to visit me anymore.</font>

145
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,082
<font color="yellow">It's better if we don't see each other.</font>

146
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:15,582
<font color="yellow">Take care of your injury.</font>

147
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,781
<font color="yellow">You don't need to put gauze on it.
Put this on it.</font>

148
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,922
<font color="yellow">I'll drive you home.</font>

149
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,578
<font color="yellow">It's getting late. Just go home.</font>

150
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,370
<font color="yellow">No, I want to drive you home.</font>

151
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,419
<font color="yellow">In Joo, isn't your uncle a lawyer?</font>

152
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,049
<font color="yellow">All right, I'll get her a lawyer.</font>

153
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:17,228
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of everything for her,
so I want you to back out.</font>

154
00:13:17,228 --> 00:13:18,789
<font color="yellow">I don't need to do that.</font>

155
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,808
<font color="yellow">If there is a scandal,
the weakest person will suffer most.</font>

156
00:13:21,808 --> 00:13:22,888
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

157
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,000
<font color="yellow">I know that Hye Jung will suffer most
because of this lie.</font>

158
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,159
<font color="yellow">You should leave Granny's house.</font>

159
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,906
<font color="yellow">It looks worse because you live there.</font>

160
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:32,888
<font color="yellow">People who think that way
are the strange ones.</font>

161
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:35,140
<font color="yellow">I don't need to hear this kind of
criticism from you.</font>

162
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,689
<font color="yellow">It's not criticism. It's jealousy.</font>

163
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:39,097
<font color="yellow">- In Joo!
- Stay away from Hye Jung.</font>

164
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:40,982
<font color="yellow">She's a really charming girl.</font>

165
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:43,958
<font color="yellow">You're going too far. She's my student.</font>

166
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,509
<font color="yellow">Yes, she's a minor.</font>

167
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:49,539
<font color="yellow">She should be protected,
so you need to act properly.</font>

168
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:53,678
<font color="yellow">I don't want to drive you.
I changed my mind.</font>

169
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:19,206
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

170
00:14:19,783 --> 00:14:21,925
<font color="yellow">Nothing will be resolved if I do nothing.</font>

171
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,394
<font color="yellow">-
- Is that you, son?</font>

172
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,768
<font color="yellow">You need to come here.</font>

173
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:38,178
<font color="yellow">If this is about Hye Jung,
don't talk to me about it.</font>

174
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,728
<font color="yellow">She's your daughter so
who else should I talk to?</font>

175
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:45,105
<font color="yellow">She got into some trouble
and she might go to prison.</font>

176
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:47,278
<font color="yellow">Whether she goes to prison
or emigrates to</font>

177
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:49,103
<font color="yellow">I don't need to know.</font>

178
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,996
<font color="yellow">Then you should come
because I have cancer.</font>

179
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:52,491
<font color="yellow">Stop putting on a show.</font>

180
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,694
<font color="yellow">I'm crazy for expecting anything.</font>

181
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,463
<font color="yellow">You have to do something, Kang Mal Soon.</font>

182
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:06,725
<font color="yellow">Be strong. Be strong.</font>

183
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,756
<font color="yellow">Will this heal properly?</font>

184
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,793
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, ma'am.</font>

185
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:18,476
<font color="yellow">We don't need to do a skin graft
for a burn this minor.</font>

186
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:29,702
<font color="yellow">Hel...</font>

187
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:33,689
<font color="yellow">Oh, Doctor! What are you...</font>

188
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,640
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here, Grandma?</font>

189
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,852
<font color="yellow">That young lady in bed is my daughter.</font>

190
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:44,077
<font color="yellow">Oh no, what do I do?
I'm so sorry, Doctor.</font>

191
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:48,331
<font color="yellow">My granddaughter did a great wrong
against your daughter.</font>

192
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:51,476
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Are you very hurt?</font>

193
00:15:51,476 --> 00:15:53,437
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

194
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:57,467
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- What do you mean you're okay?</font>

195
00:15:58,246 --> 00:15:59,410
<font color="yellow">Leave!</font>

196
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,553
<font color="yellow">Can anyone enter VIP rooms like this?</font>

197
00:16:02,553 --> 00:16:04,985
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Grandma, please leave.</font>

198
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:06,997
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

199
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:09,437
<font color="yellow">There is nothing I can say
to make this better.</font>

200
00:16:09,437 --> 00:16:10,766
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

201
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:12,803
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

202
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,307
<font color="yellow">Take this thing out of here!</font>

203
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,390
<font color="yellow">It's 100 percent juice. Try it.</font>

204
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,568
<font color="yellow">Let's go together.</font>

205
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,948
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, seriously!</font>

206
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,167
<font color="yellow">Come and eat rice.</font>

207
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,824
<font color="yellow">Does someone like me even have
any right to eat rice?</font>

208
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,966
<font color="yellow">What right does anyone need to eat rice?</font>

209
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,284
<font color="yellow">Any breathing person can eat.</font>

210
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:21,177
<font color="yellow">Here, eat.</font>

211
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:26,691
<font color="yellow">I don't want to. I have no appetite.</font>

212
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,765
<font color="yellow">Have some soup, at least.</font>

213
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:32,053
<font color="yellow">It's bone broth so
it should give you strength.</font>

214
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:36,245
<font color="yellow">Don't come here anymore.
It'll only upset you to come.</font>

215
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:41,022
<font color="yellow">From now on, you live your own life
and I'll live my own life.</font>

216
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,816
<font color="yellow">You think you can say whatever you want
because you have a mouth?</font>

217
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:47,692
<font color="yellow">How can I live off on my own
and you on your own?</font>

218
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,487
<font color="yellow">You would toss me away if
you were embarrassed of me.</font>

219
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,686
<font color="yellow">Who says I would?</font>

220
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:57,128
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to live comfortably
and run far away from me.</font>

221
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:59,387
<font color="yellow">I'm just a pain so I'm giving you
an opportunity to go.</font>

222
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:03,632
<font color="yellow">Even if you don't give me an opportunity,
I can run off whenever I want.</font>

223
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:08,753
<font color="yellow">I may have lived a reckless life,
but I've never run away from anything.</font>

224
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:14,032
<font color="yellow">Give that to me if you're not
going to eat it, you wench.</font>

225
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,464
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

226
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,964
<font color="yellow">Whoever made it is a great cook.</font>

227
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:28,630
<font color="yellow">You made it for me
so why are you eating it?</font>

228
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,736
<font color="yellow">Are you hurt at all?</font>

229
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,554
<font color="yellow">I'm not hurt.</font>

230
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,871
<font color="yellow">How could you not be hurt?</font>

231
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,906
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

232
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:13,099
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

233
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,420
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy.</font>

234
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,380
<font color="yellow">I'm happy so why do I keep crying?</font>

235
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,985
<font color="yellow">You should laugh if you're happy.
Why are you crying?</font>

236
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,469
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying, Grandma?</font>

237
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:35,613
<font color="yellow">Because I'm happy.</font>

238
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:39,574
<font color="yellow">Oh, my child! Oh dear!</font>

239
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,653
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

240
00:20:10,303 --> 00:20:11,582
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

241
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,973
<font color="yellow">In Joo was here waiting,
but she got a call and left.</font>

242
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:16,439
<font color="yellow">She butts into everything.</font>

243
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,996
<font color="yellow">I like her. She's very bright.</font>

244
00:20:20,355 --> 00:20:22,213
<font color="yellow">Did you finish up at school?</font>

245
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:24,019
<font color="yellow">I just need to say
goodbye to the students.</font>

246
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,418
<font color="yellow">How is your health?</font>

247
00:20:25,418 --> 00:20:27,608
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like an old senior.</font>

248
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:30,776
<font color="yellow">One surgery isn't going to change much.</font>

249
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:36,034
<font color="yellow">Apply at Johns Hopkins and Mayo
before going to the US.</font>

250
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,809
<font color="yellow">Prepare all of the documents.</font>

251
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,512
<font color="yellow">You have lots to do. You'll be busy.</font>

252
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,716
<font color="yellow">- Are you happy?
- I am.</font>

253
00:20:42,716 --> 00:20:45,244
<font color="yellow">- How about you?
- I'm happy too.</font>

254
00:21:00,504 --> 00:21:02,822
<font color="yellow">What is it? What's wrong with you?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

255
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,861
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed to look at you.</font>

256
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:07,887
<font color="yellow">I was really petty last time.</font>

257
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:11,287
<font color="yellow">What you said did make me
come to my senses.</font>

258
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,698
<font color="yellow">Can you look after Hye Jung?</font>

259
00:21:15,927 --> 00:21:18,748
<font color="yellow">- Do you trust me?
- I have to. You're my friend.</font>

260
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,148
<font color="yellow">You sure are smart.</font>

261
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:24,098
<font color="yellow">You get what you want out of this
and draw a clear line between us.</font>

262
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:26,384
<font color="yellow">You hit two birds with one stone.</font>

263
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:44,876
<font color="yellow">You're home?</font>

264
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:47,881
<font color="yellow">Why are you out here?
Did you meet the lawyer?</font>

265
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:49,040
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

266
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,909
<font color="yellow">He was very kind, likely because
it was a favor you requested.</font>

267
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,479
<font color="yellow">I think it will work out.</font>

268
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:58,592
<font color="yellow">I hate to bring this up now...</font>

269
00:21:58,592 --> 00:21:59,999
<font color="yellow">but, I'm moving out.</font>

270
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,192
<font color="yellow">You went through a lot
because of my granddaughter.</font>

271
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,641
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Teacher Hong.</font>

272
00:22:09,643 --> 00:22:13,431
<font color="yellow">You can give me my deposit later.
I'm the one breaking our lease.</font>

273
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:14,902
<font color="yellow">Give it to me when our lease is up.</font>

274
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:19,313
<font color="yellow">Make sure to contact me when
you get settled in somewhere.</font>

275
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,152
<font color="yellow">Of course, I will.</font>

276
00:22:22,053 --> 00:22:25,044
<font color="yellow">- I'm hungry. Give me rice.
- Yeah, okay.</font>

277
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,541
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to come for a few days.</font>

278
00:22:49,574 --> 00:22:51,449
<font color="yellow">I told you that you don't
have to come at all.</font>

279
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:53,793
<font color="yellow">Stop saying things that you don't mean.</font>

280
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,614
<font color="yellow">Are you so great?</font>

281
00:22:56,544 --> 00:22:58,669
<font color="yellow">When you do bad things,
you're just saying...</font>

282
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,275
<font color="yellow">"Please look at me. Look at me."</font>

283
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:02,736
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know that?</font>

284
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,613
<font color="yellow">You're so great,
yet you run a restaurant.</font>

285
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:07,042
<font color="yellow">Why not become President of Korea?</font>

286
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,467
<font color="yellow">You seem lively now that you've had food.</font>

287
00:23:10,971 --> 00:23:13,986
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I can't come next week.</font>

288
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,671
<font color="yellow">Aren't you even going to ask me
why I can't come?</font>

289
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:21,579
<font color="yellow">What an odd thing to demand.
You could just tell me.</font>

290
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,170
<font color="yellow">Why can't you come?</font>

291
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:25,633
<font color="yellow">I'm getting surgery.</font>

292
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,841
<font color="yellow">It's stomach cancer and they say
I'll be okay after surgery.</font>

293
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,673
<font color="yellow">I didn't want you to worry
and that's why I didn't tell you.</font>

294
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:37,908
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you when
I was going into surgery.</font>

295
00:23:37,908 --> 00:23:44,015
<font color="yellow">Since you're bored in jail,
you might as well worry about me.</font>

296
00:23:44,015 --> 00:23:45,195
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you.</font>

297
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:50,173
<font color="yellow">I thought about waiting for you to
come out before doing my surgery.</font>

298
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:52,252
<font color="yellow">But, I wanted to show you.</font>

299
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:57,681
<font color="yellow">This is how much your grandma
loves her life.</font>

300
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:00,331
<font color="yellow">This is how badly I want to live.</font>

301
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:07,341
<font color="yellow">The doctor says that it hasn't spread,
so I should be okay after surgery.</font>

302
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:11,114
<font color="yellow">Still, they're cutting up my body and
internal organs so how could it be okay?</font>

303
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:13,411
<font color="yellow">- I could die.
- Grandma!</font>

304
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,986
<font color="yellow">You're just sitting in there.</font>

305
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:19,450
<font color="yellow">Not even thinking of coming out,
worrying, and if you end up in prison...</font>

306
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:22,766
<font color="yellow">you might not be there when I die.</font>

307
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,151
<font color="yellow">You won't die. Don't worry.</font>

308
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:26,442
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

309
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:28,883
<font color="yellow">So, you have to live too.</font>

310
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:33,517
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever it takes to save you.</font>

311
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:36,977
<font color="yellow">You have to do something
for yourself too.</font>

312
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,611
<font color="yellow">You didn't start that fire, did you?</font>

313
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:48,752
<font color="yellow">Don't take all the blame and speak up.</font>

314
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,797
<font color="yellow">You should go now.</font>

315
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,514
<font color="yellow">Get surgery and come back healthy.</font>

316
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:23,994
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

317
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,357
<font color="yellow">Grandma...</font>

318
00:26:11,492 --> 00:26:12,910
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

319
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:36,124
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

320
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:39,048
<font color="yellow">If you look at Jin Seo Woo's statement</font>

321
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:42,717
<font color="yellow">"Cheon Soon Hee lured me to a place
and Yoo Hye Jung was there."</font>

322
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:46,194
<font color="yellow">"Yoo Hye Jung wanted revenge for the
post I put up on the school site."</font>

323
00:26:46,194 --> 00:26:49,992
<font color="yellow">"Yoo Hye Jung demanded that I
delete my post and we fought."</font>

324
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:56,938
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo doesn't know
how the fire started.</font>

325
00:26:56,938 --> 00:26:59,444
<font color="yellow">They were arguing so she doesn't know.</font>

326
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:02,646
<font color="yellow">If you did it,
you realize that a person was injured.</font>

327
00:27:02,646 --> 00:27:05,074
<font color="yellow">It's a minimum of five years in a
Youth Detention Center.</font>

328
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:07,223
<font color="yellow">Are you still saying you did it?</font>

329
00:27:09,954 --> 00:27:12,245
<font color="yellow">I will take her with me.</font>

330
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:13,781
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid you can't.</font>

331
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:15,759
<font color="yellow">We're re-writing the report.</font>

332
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,246
<font color="yellow">You crazy girl.</font>

333
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,876
<font color="yellow">Even if you like your friend,
do you want to become a criminal?</font>

334
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,128
<font color="yellow">Why do you like someone like that?</font>

335
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:27,107
<font color="yellow">You have your parents and siblings.
Do you like her more than them?</font>

336
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:28,194
<font color="yellow">I like her more!</font>

337
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:34,554
<font color="yellow">Since the day I was born until now,
only Hye Jung treated me with sincerity.</font>

338
00:27:34,554 --> 00:27:35,783
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

339
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,593
<font color="yellow">You and Mom always say so.</font>

340
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:41,038
<font color="yellow">That you suffer so much
for having a child later in life</font>

341
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,207
<font color="yellow">and shouldn't have had me.</font>

342
00:27:42,207 --> 00:27:44,427
<font color="yellow">Our whole family is embarrassed of me.</font>

343
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,548
<font color="yellow">All my brothers and sister-in-laws.</font>

344
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:49,868
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung actually likes me.</font>

345
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:51,949
<font color="yellow">She's not embarrassed of me.</font>

346
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,996
<font color="yellow">I won't leave her alone and leave.</font>

347
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:58,323
<font color="yellow">All right... do whatever you please.</font>

348
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:02,747
<font color="yellow">I don't know how I had a child like this
who's brought such shame to our family.</font>

349
00:28:21,191 --> 00:28:23,265
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung, get out.</font>

350
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:25,714
<font color="yellow">Get out of there.</font>

351
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:31,766
<font color="yellow">You. Get inside.</font>

352
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:49,985
<font color="yellow">Why would you?</font>

353
00:28:50,325 --> 00:28:51,829
<font color="yellow">I did it.</font>

354
00:28:51,829 --> 00:28:54,364
<font color="yellow">Don't do this. You can't survive in here.</font>

355
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:56,435
<font color="yellow">If you can do it, so can I.</font>

356
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,955
<font color="yellow">Please let her go. She can't be here.</font>

357
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:02,685
<font color="yellow">I asked her to call Seo Woo for me and
she got mixed up in it because of that.</font>

358
00:29:02,685 --> 00:29:04,025
<font color="yellow">Are you two dating?</font>

359
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,883
<font color="yellow">You're just full of affection
for each other.</font>

360
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:09,735
<font color="yellow">You two can figure out
the love issues, okay?</font>

361
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:14,611
<font color="yellow">Dummy, tell them now that it wasn't you.</font>

362
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:16,675
<font color="yellow">This isn't going to change anything.</font>

363
00:29:16,675 --> 00:29:18,968
<font color="yellow">I'm just an unlucky girl
and that's why this happened.</font>

364
00:29:18,968 --> 00:29:23,143
<font color="yellow">I... didn't leave you and run away.</font>

365
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:29,543
<font color="yellow">Just remember that.</font>

366
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,830
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung or whoever she is...
has been expelled.</font>

367
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,104
<font color="yellow">What about my homeroom teacher?</font>

368
00:29:46,236 --> 00:29:48,415
<font color="yellow">Don't even think about
that school anymore.</font>

369
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:51,166
<font color="yellow">You should transfer.
That place is not up to our standard.</font>

370
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,209
<font color="yellow">Go to school near
your grandfather's house.</font>

371
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,766
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat this.</font>

372
00:29:55,265 --> 00:29:57,734
<font color="yellow">I feel stuffy in here.
I'm going to step outside.</font>

373
00:29:57,734 --> 00:29:59,511
<font color="yellow">Where would you go at this hour?</font>

374
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:01,035
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

375
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:37,400
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, wake up! Seo Woo, Seo Woo!</font>

376
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,659
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo, Seo Woo! Wake up!</font>

377
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,975
<font color="yellow">- Get her on my back. Hurry!
- Okay.</font>

378
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:58,903
<font color="yellow">Hurry! Let's get out of here.</font>

379
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:17,610
<font color="yellow">Did you escape from the police station?</font>

380
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,996
<font color="yellow">You know the fire wasn't set on purpose.</font>

381
00:31:20,996 --> 00:31:22,430
<font color="yellow">It was an accident.</font>

382
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,238
<font color="yellow">If you told the truth,
it could end without anyone getting hurt.</font>

383
00:31:26,238 --> 00:31:28,868
<font color="yellow">The important point is that
you called me to that place.</font>

384
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:33,902
<font color="yellow">You called me to that place because
you had intent to threaten me.</font>

385
00:31:33,902 --> 00:31:35,727
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing as setting the fire.</font>

386
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:40,651
<font color="yellow">Soon Hee came to the police station
and told them she started the fire.</font>

387
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,527
<font color="yellow">Seriously, that girl can't be stopped.</font>

388
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:47,457
<font color="yellow">Is she crazy?</font>

389
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,369
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

390
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:52,448
<font color="yellow">Things were good with us.
You helped me with my studies--</font>

391
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:55,138
<font color="yellow">I get angry... whenever I see you.</font>

392
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,890
<font color="yellow">I don't know why either.</font>

393
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:01,858
<font color="yellow">I start to feel very angry.</font>

394
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:05,992
<font color="yellow">What can I do, then?</font>

395
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:09,044
<font color="yellow">Should I beg,
though I doubt it will work?</font>

396
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,756
<font color="yellow">You need try it to see
if it works or not.</font>

397
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,898
<font color="yellow">Now I know.</font>

398
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,047
<font color="yellow">It doesn't work.</font>

399
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:40,387
<font color="yellow">I was worried I wouldn't be there
for your surgery.</font>

400
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:06,684
<font color="yellow">Oh, you scared me!</font>

401
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,881
<font color="yellow">I was sleeping.</font>

402
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:11,258
<font color="yellow">Hey, when did you get out?</font>

403
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,628
<font color="yellow">How did you get out, huh?</font>

404
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,443
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

405
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:16,581
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

406
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:19,251
<font color="yellow">I can't be sitting around like this.</font>

407
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,099
<font color="yellow">This isn't it.</font>

408
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:35,965
<font color="yellow">She needs to eat something else.</font>

409
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,501
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung, eat this. Come on.</font>

410
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,001
<font color="yellow">Later.</font>

411
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:46,180
<font color="yellow">You have to eat it now. Just chew.</font>

412
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:57,104
<font color="yellow">You're being admitted into
the hospital today.</font>

413
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:58,746
<font color="yellow">You have a good memory.</font>

414
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,537
<font color="yellow">My child.</font>

415
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,032
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Lawyer.
- Your welcome.</font>

416
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,505
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

417
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,617
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

418
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:27,137
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dad.</font>

419
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:31,695
<font color="yellow">Just being in the jail cell one day
was so scary.</font>

420
00:35:32,394 --> 00:35:35,965
<font color="yellow">Do you think I did it for you?
You brought such shame to our family!</font>

421
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:38,950
<font color="yellow">Still, thank you for getting me out.</font>

422
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:41,760
<font color="yellow">Once this whole mess is over,
I'm sending you to your aunt in Canada.</font>

423
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,845
<font color="yellow">I'm prepared for that.</font>

424
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:47,613
<font color="yellow">You must be so embarrassed right now
because of a daughter like me.</font>

425
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:53,396
<font color="yellow">Dad! Dad, Dad...</font>

426
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:56,735
<font color="yellow">I have no excuses.</font>

427
00:35:56,735 --> 00:36:00,976
<font color="yellow">However, I am sorry I couldn't stay with
you all until the end of this semester.</font>

428
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,807
<font color="yellow">I trust that you will all
make the right judgments.</font>

429
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:09,092
<font color="yellow">Once time has passed,
let's meet again.</font>

430
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:11,063
<font color="yellow">Class President.</font>

431
00:36:13,945 --> 00:36:14,999
<font color="yellow">Attention.</font>

432
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:20,320
<font color="yellow">No matter where I end up,
I will remember all of you.</font>

433
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:25,209
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

434
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,068
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

435
00:36:45,376 --> 00:36:46,829
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

436
00:36:48,155 --> 00:36:50,550
<font color="yellow">I guess you're worried
about your grandma.</font>

437
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,595
<font color="yellow">Who says I'm worried?</font>

438
00:36:52,595 --> 00:36:55,468
<font color="yellow">You've survived all these years.
Cancer's not going to kill you.</font>

439
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:57,800
<font color="yellow">You said the doctor told you not to
worry either.</font>

440
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,468
<font color="yellow">You got expelled from school.
What are you going to do?</font>

441
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,410
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you my plans once
you're out of surgery.</font>

442
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,599
<font color="yellow">What kind of trouble are you
going to cause?</font>

443
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,291
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me?</font>

444
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,334
<font color="yellow">You have to act trustworthy
for me to trust you.</font>

445
00:37:09,735 --> 00:37:12,184
<font color="yellow">Even if I wanted to die,
I can't die because of you.</font>

446
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:15,956
<font color="yellow">I'd better keep causing trouble, then.
You'll live a long life.</font>

447
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,794
<font color="yellow">Stop saying nonsense.</font>

448
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:20,365
<font color="yellow">- "Stop saying nonsense."
- Oh my.</font>

449
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:24,584
<font color="yellow">Oh, Grandma...</font>

450
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:38,582
<font color="yellow">I'll be out soon.</font>

451
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:42,052
<font color="yellow">Don't sit around crying or anything.
Go get something to eat.</font>

452
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,177
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business and just be well.</font>

453
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:46,928
<font color="yellow">My doctor is very good at what he does.</font>

454
00:37:46,928 --> 00:37:49,916
<font color="yellow">My doctor is good looking and smart.</font>

455
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,765
<font color="yellow">I trust my doctor.</font>

456
00:37:51,765 --> 00:37:53,927
<font color="yellow">Since when did he become "my doctor"?</font>

457
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,704
<font color="yellow">He's that girl Seo Woo's father.</font>

458
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:00,847
<font color="yellow">You'll be indebted to her for life.</font>

459
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:04,175
<font color="yellow">We're heading in now.</font>

460
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:41,878
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know. 5:00 p.m.</font>

461
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:45,075
<font color="yellow">I'm in surgery now.
I'll finish up quickly.</font>

462
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:50,064
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's wider than
I originally thought.</font>

463
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,633
<font color="yellow">Suction!</font>

464
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,535
<font color="yellow">Blood pressure is dropping.</font>

465
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:16,903
<font color="yellow">Get more blood now!</font>

466
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:19,613
<font color="yellow">She's in arrest!</font>

467
00:39:43,363 --> 00:39:45,713
<font color="yellow">I did my best but it didn't go very well.</font>

468
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:49,164
<font color="yellow">What do you mean when you say
it didn't go very well?</font>

469
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:50,784
<font color="yellow">Like I said, it didn't go very well.</font>

470
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,005
<font color="yellow">You should prepare for her funeral
with your parents.</font>

471
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,006
<font color="yellow">That makes no sense...</font>

472
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:59,224
<font color="yellow">My grandma is Kang Mal Soon.
Kang Mal Soon.</font>

473
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,883
<font color="yellow">Kang Mal Soon would never die.</font>

474
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:03,414
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to the adults about this.</font>

475
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:06,037
<font color="yellow">Why can't you talk to me?
Why do you need to talk to adults?</font>

476
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:09,653
<font color="yellow">My grandma was the closest to me.</font>

477
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:13,724
<font color="yellow">Instead of speaking to the person closest
to her, why would you speak to others?</font>

478
00:40:13,724 --> 00:40:15,807
<font color="yellow">Because adults have common sense.</font>

479
00:40:54,012 --> 00:40:55,700
<font color="yellow">Our family is all gathered together.</font>

480
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,968
<font color="yellow">Today is a turning point for our family.</font>

481
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,039
<font color="yellow">Let's drink to it.</font>

482
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,106
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your dinner, Father.
- I will.</font>

483
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:12,646
<font color="yellow">The fragrance is lovely.</font>

484
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,282
<font color="yellow">Tastes great.</font>

485
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:16,927
<font color="yellow">Honey, eat lots.</font>

486
00:42:25,534 --> 00:42:29,343
<font color="yellow">You were born into this world,
so why not live a special life?</font>

487
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:32,856
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you show me something
like that before I die?</font>

488
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:09,566
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault.</font>

489
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:12,059
<font color="yellow">Why are you even crying?</font>

490
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:15,157
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have left you
with your grandmother.</font>

491
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:16,726
<font color="yellow">Right, Honey?</font>

492
00:43:16,936 --> 00:43:21,655
<font color="yellow">In the end, you managed to
gobble her up too.</font>

493
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:26,215
<font color="yellow">You've been expelled from school too.
What are you going to do?</font>

494
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,865
<font color="yellow">You received money from
the hospital, didn't you?</font>

495
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,400
<font color="yellow">What money?</font>

496
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:34,385
<font color="yellow">Ah, money for the funeral?</font>

497
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,247
<font color="yellow">Why would you concern yourself with that?</font>

498
00:43:41,985 --> 00:43:44,392
<font color="yellow">I told you something went wrong
with the surgery.</font>

499
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:48,519
<font color="yellow">How could someone who went in
laughing come out dead?</font>

500
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:50,602
<font color="yellow">I know they did something wrong!</font>

501
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,246
<font color="yellow">Stop causing such a fuss.</font>

502
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:55,894
<font color="yellow">Since when have you cared
so much about your grandma?</font>

503
00:43:55,894 --> 00:43:57,367
<font color="yellow">She was an old lady.</font>

504
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,316
<font color="yellow">Surgery is hard for young people,
let alone a senior.</font>

505
00:44:00,316 --> 00:44:04,265
<font color="yellow">There can be complications during
surgery and it's possible to die.</font>

506
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,046
<font color="yellow">"It's possible to die"?</font>

507
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,238
<font color="yellow">"It's possible to die"!</font>

508
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:13,997
<font color="yellow">How could you say that?</font>

509
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:16,309
<font color="yellow">Would you say that if your daughter died?</font>

510
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:19,959
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that about my Yoo Na?</font>

511
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:25,184
<font color="yellow">What about you, Dad?</font>

512
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:28,428
<font color="yellow">Don't you have anything to say?</font>

513
00:44:32,992 --> 00:44:34,378
<font color="yellow">Let's go quietly.</font>

514
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:39,081
<font color="yellow">"Quietly," you have to be kidding me.</font>

515
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:55,421
<font color="yellow">You killed my grandma, right?</font>

516
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:56,990
<font color="yellow">You killed her?</font>

517
00:44:57,892 --> 00:45:00,014
<font color="yellow">You said she'd live
if you removed the cancer.</font>

518
00:45:00,014 --> 00:45:02,432
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's with this girl?
Move aside.</font>

519
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:03,773
<font color="yellow">Go on!</font>

520
00:45:03,773 --> 00:45:05,441
<font color="yellow">You think this hospital will do well?</font>

521
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,140
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get away with this!</font>

522
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,421
<font color="yellow">Let her go.</font>

523
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,970
<font color="yellow">Exactly, what is it that you can do?</font>

524
00:45:14,302 --> 00:45:15,832
<font color="yellow">I already spoke to your parents.</font>

525
00:45:15,832 --> 00:45:18,930
<font color="yellow">We've come to an agreement
and they even accepted payment.</font>

526
00:45:19,872 --> 00:45:21,606
<font color="yellow">I find this regrettable.</font>

527
00:45:21,606 --> 00:45:24,015
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to feel guilty about
because I did my best.</font>

528
00:45:24,015 --> 00:45:25,932
<font color="yellow">I took care of things afterward, as well.</font>

529
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:29,954
<font color="yellow">If you did your best and a person died,
you should be embarrassed.</font>

530
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,133
<font color="yellow">Can you forgive yourself
just because you did your best?</font>

531
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:37,401
<font color="yellow">If you can find something
showing that I didn't do my best</font>

532
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,541
<font color="yellow">then I will be punished
however you see fit.</font>

533
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:43,660
<font color="yellow">However, I cannot forgive
this kind of reckless behavior.</font>

534
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,084
<font color="yellow">If you cause a disturbance
in the hospital</font>

535
00:45:46,084 --> 00:45:47,548
<font color="yellow">I won't let it go next time.</font>

536
00:46:59,845 --> 00:47:02,546
<font color="yellow">Of course, purely as a student.</font>

537
00:47:02,546 --> 00:47:07,570
<font color="yellow">I've always helped out Hong Ji Hong,
so I agreed to help you.</font>

538
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:09,523
<font color="yellow">I can take care of myself.</font>

539
00:47:11,943 --> 00:47:13,428
<font color="yellow">It's a school you can go to.</font>

540
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:16,858
<font color="yellow">It's in Gangwon-do.
They have dorms there.</font>

541
00:47:18,057 --> 00:47:19,947
<font color="yellow">I'm going to take my GED exam.</font>

542
00:47:19,947 --> 00:47:22,039
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be apart from my grandma.</font>

543
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:24,613
<font color="yellow">You like Ji Hong, right?</font>

544
00:47:25,546 --> 00:47:29,593
<font color="yellow">Birds of a feather flock together.</font>

545
00:47:29,593 --> 00:47:32,925
<font color="yellow">You and Ji Hong live in different worlds.</font>

546
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:35,573
<font color="yellow">Ji Hong and I run in the same circles.</font>

547
00:47:35,573 --> 00:47:38,155
<font color="yellow">When we are together,
it's a win-win situation for both of us.</font>

548
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:44,693
<font color="yellow">To get straight to the point,
you'd be a hindrance in Ji Hong's life.</font>

549
00:48:00,173 --> 00:48:01,374
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

550
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:11,206
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me?</font>

551
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:13,715
<font color="yellow">Why did I have to hear about Granny
from someone else?</font>

552
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,119
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to tell you
about my grandma?</font>

553
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,648
<font color="yellow">Of course you should tell me.</font>

554
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,809
<font color="yellow">What are you planning on doing?</font>

555
00:48:28,845 --> 00:48:31,267
<font color="yellow">Why do you care what I plan on doing?</font>

556
00:48:31,267 --> 00:48:34,657
<font color="yellow">Of course I care. You're my student.</font>

557
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:39,025
<font color="yellow">Do you care this much about
all of your students?</font>

558
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:49,628
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

559
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,860
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is
the right time to talk.</font>

560
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,390
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

561
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:00,925
<font color="yellow">Should I really go?</font>

562
00:49:06,651 --> 00:49:07,709
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

563
00:49:08,494 --> 00:49:10,936
<font color="yellow">I don't think I want to see you again.</font>

564
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:14,416
<font color="yellow">I can help you.</font>

565
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,765
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

566
00:49:18,302 --> 00:49:20,477
<font color="yellow">Go back to the place where you live.</font>

567
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:23,197
<font color="yellow">I will go back to where I live.</font>

568
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,204
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get away from here?</font>

569
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,501
<font color="yellow">Doctor, here!</font>

570
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:56,791
<font color="yellow">We need an MRI so get it ready now.</font>

571
00:51:58,066 --> 00:51:59,236
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

572
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:03,702
<font color="yellow">Where is the doctor?</font>

573
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:09,059
<font color="yellow">Call the doctor! Call a doctor!</font>

574
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,351
<font color="yellow">Our boss is here.
Is this the best you can do?</font>

575
00:52:13,351 --> 00:52:14,468
<font color="yellow">You do it.</font>

576
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:17,220
<font color="yellow">You said that neurosurgery is
the most important in the ER.</font>

577
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,680
<font color="yellow">You said you guys have to look at
all of the patients first.</font>

578
00:52:20,711 --> 00:52:22,981
<font color="yellow">Is it you? Get over here.</font>

579
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:25,059
<font color="yellow">So... what brings you here today?</font>

580
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,401
<font color="yellow">We're here because he's hurt.</font>

581
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:30,244
<font color="yellow">Stop being scared! Stop!
We're people too. Come here.</font>

582
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:32,630
<font color="yellow">He's bleeding here.</font>

583
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,111
<font color="yellow">Hey! What do you think you're doing?</font>

584
00:52:36,336 --> 00:52:38,807
<font color="yellow">I... I was just nervous.</font>

585
00:52:38,807 --> 00:52:40,613
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Oh, Doctor!</font>

586
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:43,242
<font color="yellow">He's the one in charge here. Go on.</font>

587
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:44,639
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am in charge.</font>

588
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:45,668
<font color="yellow">- You're a doctor?
- Yes.</font>

589
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:46,722
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and look.</font>

590
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:50,570
<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

591
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:57,814
<font color="yellow">First, let's do an AGAB and routine.</font>

592
00:52:57,814 --> 00:53:01,256
<font color="yellow">- Then do a CT and and MRI.
- Okay.</font>

593
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,436
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

594
00:53:05,436 --> 00:53:10,412
<font color="yellow">You think I don't know that you're trying
to make money off me with useless exams?</font>

595
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:15,235
<font color="yellow">Hey! Can't you even do that properly?</font>

596
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:19,593
<font color="yellow">Boss is talking to you right now.</font>

597
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,282
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at him
instead of responding?</font>

598
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,709
<font color="yellow">Should I fold you in half
like an accordion?</font>

599
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:25,709
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

600
00:53:25,709 --> 00:53:28,492
<font color="yellow">You're taking out your anger
on him, right?</font>

601
00:53:28,492 --> 00:53:29,572
<font color="yellow">No... of course not.</font>

602
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,762
<font color="yellow">- Clench your jaw.
- No.</font>

603
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:33,472
<font color="yellow">Clench your jaw.</font>

604
00:53:36,412 --> 00:53:37,695
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

605
00:53:39,231 --> 00:53:40,343
<font color="yellow">A medic?</font>

606
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:43,092
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell by looking? I'm a doctor.</font>

607
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:53,320
<font color="yellow">This is a place for patients
to receive treatment.</font>

608
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,403
<font color="yellow">If you're not a patient, please leave.</font>

609
00:53:55,403 --> 00:53:58,771
<font color="yellow">Who are you to
speak that way to our boss?</font>

610
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,840
<font color="yellow">I'm the person who will be
treating this patient.</font>

611
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,881
<font color="yellow">It's my job to create the optimal
environment to treat this patient.</font>

612
00:54:03,881 --> 00:54:06,041
<font color="yellow">I won't receive treatment from a woman.</font>

613
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:09,682
<font color="yellow">Bring a man.</font>

614
00:54:09,682 --> 00:54:12,662
<font color="yellow">Hey, take her outside.</font>

615
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:13,834
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

616
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,202
<font color="yellow">Hey, just go outside.</font>

617
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:19,599
<font color="yellow">Come on, Doctor.
Why not go and take a break?</font>

618
00:54:51,003 --> 00:54:54,421
<font color="yellow">Senior, I've liked for a long time.</font>

619
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:56,823
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

620
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,155
<font color="yellow">Isn't there something fresher?</font>

621
00:55:00,155 --> 00:55:02,528
<font color="yellow">I have to get that animal
to feel something.</font>

622
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:07,818
<font color="yellow">Yoon Do, I've been watching over you
since our hospital training days.</font>

623
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,070
<font color="yellow">"Watching over"?</font>

624
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:12,568
<font color="yellow">I sound like a stalker.</font>

625
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:16,561
<font color="yellow">No, let's keep it simple.</font>

626
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:18,789
<font color="yellow">It won't work with him if I try too hard.</font>

627
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:24,088
<font color="yellow">Jung Yoon Do, you're mine.</font>

628
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:32,481
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you wait a bit?
You started eating without me.</font>

629
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,805
<font color="yellow">You're acting like a girl now?</font>

630
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,003
<font color="yellow">Ask your boyfriend to do that
when you get one.</font>

631
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,209
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can eat.</font>

632
00:55:41,807 --> 00:55:43,791
<font color="yellow">Why would you buy me a meal
in a place like this?</font>

633
00:55:43,791 --> 00:55:45,130
<font color="yellow">There are lots of nicer places.</font>

634
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:48,302
<font color="yellow">There are places that are nicer,
more expensive, and have bad food.</font>

635
00:55:48,302 --> 00:55:50,633
<font color="yellow">Do you know how famous
and good the food here is?</font>

636
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:53,236
<font color="yellow">You wear 20,000 won socks
and you're so thrifty with food.</font>

637
00:55:53,236 --> 00:55:54,771
<font color="yellow">I've told you before.</font>

638
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:57,227
<font color="yellow">The completion of an interior
is the finishing materials.</font>

639
00:55:57,227 --> 00:55:59,599
<font color="yellow">The completion of an outfit is socks.</font>

640
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:01,106
<font color="yellow">Just hurry up and eat.</font>

641
00:56:01,106 --> 00:56:02,715
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not eating.</font>

642
00:56:02,715 --> 00:56:04,961
<font color="yellow">Then let's go in.
I have to go to the hospital.</font>

643
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:06,881
<font color="yellow">I have something to say.</font>

644
00:56:09,095 --> 00:56:10,251
<font color="yellow">Then say it.</font>

645
00:56:11,218 --> 00:56:14,481
<font color="yellow">I know if I try to put it into
pretty words it won't work on you.</font>

646
00:56:14,506 --> 00:56:15,506
<font color="yellow">So I will give you facts.</font>

647
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:16,724
<font color="yellow">Hey, ma'am.</font>

648
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:25,108
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- Who else am I looking at?</font>

649
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:26,669
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at you, ma'am.</font>

650
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:31,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not a "ma'am."
You have very bad eyes.</font>

651
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,059
<font color="yellow">Sorry, I thought you two were married.</font>

652
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:40,851
<font color="yellow">Senior, people must think
we look very good together.</font>

653
00:56:40,851 --> 00:56:42,896
<font color="yellow">That's not why I thought that.</font>

654
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:45,340
<font color="yellow">The guy is treating you with
such disinterest.</font>

655
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,130
<font color="yellow">A boyfriend wouldn't do that.</font>

656
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:51,030
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this woman is really playing
around with my emotions.</font>

657
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:55,689
<font color="yellow">By the way, miss,
you sure are very strong.</font>

658
00:56:56,053 --> 00:56:57,771
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for it.</font>

659
00:57:00,271 --> 00:57:03,287
<font color="yellow">Why don't you try apologizing first?
Who asked you for money?</font>

660
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,675
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I am sorry.</font>

661
00:57:05,675 --> 00:57:08,845
<font color="yellow">You did something wrong too.
That was on the verge of falling off.</font>

662
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:11,059
<font color="yellow">What would you have done
if someone got injured?</font>

663
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,952
<font color="yellow">Senior... are you leaving?</font>

664
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,392
<font color="yellow">Senior, haven't you ever seen a drama?</font>

665
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,791
<font color="yellow">A man should save the woman,
speak up, and offer money here.</font>

666
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,785
<font color="yellow">Clean up your own poop, okay?</font>

667
00:57:25,171 --> 00:57:28,059
<font color="yellow">- Senior!
- Where are you going?</font>

668
00:57:28,059 --> 00:57:31,631
<font color="yellow">Gosh! How much is it? I can pay for it.</font>

669
00:57:35,213 --> 00:57:37,365
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right, Ma'am?
- Oh no!</font>

670
00:57:37,365 --> 00:57:40,111
<font color="yellow">- Oh no.
- What do I do?</font>

671
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:41,347
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

672
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,818
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Call an ambulance!</font>

673
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:45,617
<font color="yellow">- What do I do?
- Ma'am!</font>

674
00:57:57,756 --> 00:57:59,302
<font color="yellow">Is the operating room ready?</font>

675
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:00,586
<font color="yellow">Yes, room 1.</font>

676
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,121
<font color="yellow">Why is it room 1 and not 2?</font>

677
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:05,139
<font color="yellow">Room 2 is being used by the new fellow.</font>

678
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:06,570
<font color="yellow">It was an emergency epidural hemorrhage.</font>

679
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,727
<font color="yellow">Why is a surgery I don't
know about in progress?</font>

680
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:09,909
<font color="yellow">I'm on duty today.</font>

681
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:12,012
<font color="yellow">I'm responsible for all
of the surgeries today.</font>

682
00:58:12,012 --> 00:58:15,825
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know! I told her that
she can't, but she just--</font>

683
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,070
<font color="yellow">You should have called me.
What the hell are you doing?</font>

684
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:21,678
<font color="yellow">I let you have some freedom
and this is what you do?</font>

685
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,767
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.</font>

686
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,298
<font color="yellow">You'll take responsibility
for what you're sorry for.</font>
