<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,100
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed because of your mom.</font>

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,680
<font color="yellow">So why don't you just admit yourself
into the hospital like I told you to?</font>

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,420
<font color="yellow">If you had admitted yourself already,
this wouldn't have happened.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let me take a look.</font>

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,500
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Do it later.</font>

17
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,050
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,980

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,080
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,150
<font color="yellow">- Do you know her?
- Of course, I know her.</font>

21
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,790
<font color="yellow">She's the one who
did that to our Seo Woo--</font>

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,200
<font color="yellow">She's my friend.</font>

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,440
<font color="yellow">I said that she's my friend.</font>

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,130
<font color="yellow">We should move him into a room.</font>

26
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,240
<font color="yellow">Let's do that.</font>

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,940
<font color="yellow">We'll move him into a VIP room.</font>

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,720
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is going on here?</font>

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,760
<font color="yellow">This is the hospital.
Dad and I work here.</font>

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,460
<font color="yellow">I wish you would keep
proper etiquette around here.</font>

31
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,320
<font color="yellow">We'll move you into a patient room.</font>

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,750
<font color="yellow">I'm going to walk.</font>

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,410
<font color="yellow">- Get me my shoes.
- You have none.</font>

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,580
<font color="yellow">- Go find me some slippers.
- Yes, I will.</font>

<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,640
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,480
<font color="yellow">The tumor on his spine
is the same as before.</font>

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,630
<font color="yellow">His brain is fine, as well.</font>

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,260
<font color="yellow">So it was just the sleeping pills, then.</font>

41
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,380
<font color="yellow">I'm not even his doctor,
so why was I called?</font>

42
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,730
<font color="yellow">I thought you would be
best suited for this.</font>

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,560
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't Doctor Jung Yoon Do
be better for this?</font>

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,230
<font color="yellow">Director Jin ordered you back to work
in Neurosurgery yesterday.</font>

45
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,170
<font color="yellow">Well, he never spoke to me about it.</font>

46
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,290
<font color="yellow">He spoke to me.</font>

47
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,280
<font color="yellow">Keep him hydrated for now.</font>

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,310
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

49
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,790
<font color="yellow">I'm opposed to Doctor Hong
operating on your dad.</font>

50
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,090
<font color="yellow">Are there no other doctors?
Why does it have to be him?</font>

51
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,450
<font color="yellow">There's always Yoon Do,
or let's just go to the U.S.</font>

52
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,100
<font color="yellow">Getting the surgery from
Doctor Hong Ji Hong is our best option.</font>

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,440
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "best option"?</font>

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,400
<font color="yellow">We brought him from the US
because he was good.</font>

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,160
<font color="yellow">Why would I go to the US?</font>

56
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,050
<font color="yellow">It hurts my pride.</font>

57
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,480
<font color="yellow">Is your pride more important to you
than Dad's surgery?</font>

58
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,850
<font color="yellow">I never thought I'd live to see the day.</font>

59
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,960
<font color="yellow">How could we meet him like this again?</font>

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,440
<font color="yellow">We looked at your CT and MRI,
and it hasn't changed from before.</font>

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,790
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, Professor Kim?
Why isn't Professor Hong here?</font>

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,850
<font color="yellow">Will you allow Professor Hong Ji Hong
to operate on you?</font>

63
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,400
<font color="yellow">Then, who else will operate?</font>

64
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,480
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me to the ER?
Did you know that I was working again?</font>

65
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,540
<font color="yellow">No, it's because you're the best.</font>

66
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,930
<font color="yellow">That's why I called you.</font>

67
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,150
<font color="yellow">That makes me feel good.</font>

68
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,150
<font color="yellow">Did you know about Director Jin?</font>

69
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,700
<font color="yellow">No, I just found out when I saw.
It looks very bad.</font>

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,420
<font color="yellow">Yes, even with the surgery,
he won't be like he was before.</font>

71
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,180
<font color="yellow">Why don't you want to operate on him?</font>

72
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,270
<font color="yellow">We went head-to-head recently.</font>

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,580
<font color="yellow">The patient probably doesn't
feel comfortable with me.</font>

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,250
<font color="yellow">It isn't right to operate on someone
just because I can operate well.</font>

75
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,640
<font color="yellow"><i>[DOCTOR KIM TAE HO]</i></font>

76
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,860
<font color="yellow">Yes, Doctor.</font>

77
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,030
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

78
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,870
<font color="yellow">You two should talk now.</font>

79
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,150
<font color="yellow">Stay here with us.</font>

80
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,620
<font color="yellow">You two can either build trust
or build a wall with blocks.</font>

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,180
<font color="yellow">It's up to you.</font>

82
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,850
<font color="yellow">Let's have coffee once you're done.</font>

83
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,410
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,650
<font color="yellow">For what?</font>

85
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,450
<font color="yellow">For calling Professor Hong.</font>

86
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,290
<font color="yellow">I was just making a
judgment call as a doctor.</font>

87
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,080
<font color="yellow">You hate my dad, though.</font>

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="yellow">I don't like him, but he's a patient.</font>

89
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,740
<font color="yellow">I can't let my emotions get in the way.</font>

90
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,930
<font color="yellow">I can't be objective
when it comes to my dad.</font>

91
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,050
<font color="yellow">That's why he's my dad.</font>

92
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,620
<font color="yellow">I know that he hurt you.</font>

93
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,720
<font color="yellow">But he is my father,
whom I cherish very much.</font>

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,080
<font color="yellow">You have a tumor on your third
and fourth cervical vertebrae.</font>

95
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,060
<font color="yellow">We'll have to perform
a biopsy to be certain.</font>

96
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,490
<font color="yellow">However, I believe it's an ependymoma.</font>

97
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,780
<font color="yellow">An ependymoma is usually
from the cerebrospinal fluid cells.</font>

98
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,050
<font color="yellow">It's usually in the
ventricle of the brain.</font>

99
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,730
<font color="yellow">It can also be found in the spinal cord.</font>

100
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,540
<font color="yellow">In your case, it is in a
very dangerous location.</font>

101
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,170
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

102
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,380
<font color="yellow">Director, we need to
operate before it grows.</font>

103
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,740
<font color="yellow">What happens if it grows?</font>

104
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,880
<font color="yellow">It is very dangerous, even to your life.</font>

105
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,300
<font color="yellow">How are you going to operate?</font>

106
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,640
<font color="yellow">The tumor is inside your spinal cord.</font>

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,790
<font color="yellow">I'm going to open
the back of your spinal cord.</font>

108
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,130
<font color="yellow">There will be damage once you do that.</font>

109
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,490
<font color="yellow">Even if it is a success</font>

110
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,950
<font color="yellow">you'll likely have
issues with your senses.</font>

111
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,790
<font color="yellow">Your ability to control your muscles
and movement will be affected.</font>

112
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,060
<font color="yellow">There is also the chance that you
may become a quadriplegic.</font>

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,970
<font color="yellow">Let's just do the surgery quickly.</font>

114
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,580
<font color="yellow">Are you really okay with me doing it?</font>

115
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

116
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,690
<font color="yellow">I trust you as a doctor.</font>

117
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,030
<font color="yellow">There is a problem, though.</font>

118
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,090
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

119
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,990
<font color="yellow">I need Doctor Yoo Hye Jung to assist me.</font>

120
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,920
<font color="yellow">I can't do this surgery without her.</font>

121
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,090
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this to spite me
due to personal feelings?</font>

122
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,790
<font color="yellow">It's a dangerous surgery.</font>

123
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,070
<font color="yellow">Doctor Yoo and I have
worked together a lot recently.</font>

124
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,410
<font color="yellow">Our rate of success is high.</font>

125
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,120
<font color="yellow">As a doctor,
I want to save every patient.</font>

126
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,100
<font color="yellow">Yoo Min Ho? Please come in.</font>

127
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,160
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

128
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,010
<font color="yellow">I was glad to hear from you first.</font>

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,850
<font color="yellow">I went to see Grandma recently.</font>

130
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, did you? I should go too.</font>

131
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,890
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to go lately.</font>

132
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,600
<font color="yellow">Should we go together next time?</font>

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,030
<font color="yellow">Why did you accept a settlement for
Grandma's medical accident?</font>

134
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
<font color="yellow">Did you move her to a better memorial
because you felt guilty?</font>

135
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,160
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what to do back then.</font>

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,650
<font color="yellow">I didn't know where to start.</font>

137
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,140
<font color="yellow">I asked for a copy of the medical record.</font>

138
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,820
<font color="yellow">So, I looked at it. I did.</font>

139
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,130
<font color="yellow">But what was I supposed to do with it?</font>

140
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,810
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what I was looking at.</font>

141
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,690
<font color="yellow">Going down a legal path
would've taken a long time.</font>

142
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,980
<font color="yellow">Then you shouldn't have
accepted the settlement money.</font>

143
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,900
<font color="yellow">For whose sake?</font>

144
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,900
<font color="yellow">Only the hospital would gain from that.</font>

145
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,930
<font color="yellow">What could I have done in that situation?</font>

146
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,270
<font color="yellow">I need to make a living and
take care of things too.</font>

147
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,050
<font color="yellow">I was so angry too.</font>

148
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,040
<font color="yellow">Yet, that was all I could manage to do.
What could I do?</font>

149
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,910
<font color="yellow">I don't have any pity for your life.</font>

150
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,070
<font color="yellow">You know, most parents
and children are not objective</font>

151
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,830
<font color="yellow">when it comes to one another.</font>

152
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,220
<font color="yellow">But I can't think of a
single good memory with you</font>

153
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,230
<font color="yellow">no matter how hard I try.</font>

154
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,850
<font color="yellow">It's strange, though.</font>

155
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,020
<font color="yellow">I don't like you.</font>

156
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,800
<font color="yellow">Yet my heart hurt
when I heard you were sick.</font>

157
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:55,120
<font color="yellow">If you're sick or having a hard time,
I will want to help you.</font>

158
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,220
<font color="yellow">But if not...</font>

159
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,690
<font color="yellow">I think it's best that we don't meet.</font>

160
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,140
<font color="yellow">I want to start a family.</font>

161
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,260
<font color="yellow">If I didn't talk with you first...</font>

162
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,140
<font color="yellow">I didn't think I could start properly.
That's why I wanted to meet.</font>

163
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,670
<font color="yellow">Are you getting married?</font>

164
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,390
<font color="yellow">I will be, someday.</font>

165
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,100
<font color="yellow">I probably won't be contacting you.</font>

166
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,650
<font color="yellow">Live well and healthily.</font>

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

168
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:48,180
<font color="yellow">I wasn't there for you as a father.</font>

169
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,490
<font color="yellow">I made life hard for you.</font>

170
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,450
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your apology.</font>

171
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,570
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best not to get sick.</font>

172
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,180
<font color="yellow">Live your life happily.</font>

173
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:25,090
<font color="yellow">Go outside. I need to meet someone.</font>

174
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,530
<font color="yellow">Go ahead. I'm not stopping you.</font>

175
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,060
<font color="yellow">Who can't you meet
just because I'm around?</font>

176
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,290
<font color="yellow">I was totally embarrassed because of you.</font>

177
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,780
<font color="yellow">I could have come in quietly once I
had a surgery date, and now look.</font>

178
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,300
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

179
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,820
<font color="yellow">You told me to leave to meet her?</font>

180
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,130
<font color="yellow">You always leave me out.</font>

181
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,930
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me that
Doctor Hong and that girl work here?</font>

182
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,440
<font color="yellow">I'm a patient here.</font>

183
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,190
<font color="yellow">You've moved up in the world.</font>

184
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,440
<font color="yellow">How did you become a doctor, at that?</font>

185
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,210
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop.</font>

186
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,790
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

187
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,350
<font color="yellow">You heard from Professor Hong, right?</font>

188
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,730
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you're referring to.</font>

189
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:13,210
<font color="yellow">He has to operate on me.</font>

190
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,940
<font color="yellow">He's being stubborn and insisting
that you have to assist him.</font>

191
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,660
<font color="yellow">I won't do it.</font>

192
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,410
<font color="yellow">I agree with you.</font>

193
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,090
<font color="yellow">If that happens,
I'll be too worried to get the surgery.</font>

194
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,690
<font color="yellow">Go and tell that to Professor Hong.</font>

195
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,810
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

196
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,560
<font color="yellow">I will switch the doctor in charge to
Chief Kang Kyung Joon, as well.</font>

197
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,730
<font color="yellow">You do that.</font>

198
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,820
<font color="yellow"><i>[JUNG YOON DO]</i></font>

199
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,170
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you picking up?</font>

200
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,850
<font color="yellow">Do I have to?</font>

201
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,940
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

202
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,620
<font color="yellow">Have you prepared
Kim Ji Young for surgery?</font>

203
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,380
<font color="yellow">Yes, I just need to go in.</font>

204
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,640
<font color="yellow">- Your father...
- He has a nasty tumor.</font>

205
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,390
<font color="yellow">It's in such a dangerous location.</font>

206
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,910
<font color="yellow">How can it be right on the neck?</font>

207
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,650
<font color="yellow">I heard Professor Hong is operating.</font>

208
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,560
<font color="yellow">No, it hasn't been decided yet.</font>

209
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,460
<font color="yellow">I don't know why.</font>

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,120
<font color="yellow">All the nerves in the body
pass through the neck.</font>

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,010
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong...</font>

212
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,970
<font color="yellow">I have a bad feeling.</font>

213
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,180
<font color="yellow">I can't live without my dad.</font>

214
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,500
<font color="yellow">My grandpa is going through a trial.</font>

215
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,070
<font color="yellow">What do I do?</font>

216
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,630
<font color="yellow">It'll all work out.</font>

217
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,540
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

218
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,780
<font color="yellow">You were in here, Doctor Jung.</font>

219
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,700
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

220
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,370
<font color="yellow">What are your feelings for Seo Woo?</font>

221
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,840
<font color="yellow">Why do I need to tell you that?</font>

222
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
<font color="yellow">I'm Seo Woo's friend.</font>

223
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
<font color="yellow">I was by her side when she was going
through a hard time because of you.</font>

224
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,470
<font color="yellow">I think that gives me a right to know.</font>

225
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,510
<font color="yellow">You're being really polite, aren't you?</font>

226
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,780
<font color="yellow">Have you liked Seo Woo
since you two were in school?</font>

227
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,030
<font color="yellow">Is that why you've always
kept your distance from me?</font>

228
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,120
<font color="yellow">I liked her as a friend.</font>

229
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,130
<font color="yellow">Though, not anymore.</font>

230
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,580
<font color="yellow">I'm no more than a brother to Seo Woo.</font>

231
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,650
<font color="yellow">If you end up dating Seo Woo,
I'm all for it.</font>

232
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,480
<font color="yellow">Be good to her.</font>

233
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,080
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you're having a hard time.</font>

234
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,100
<font color="yellow">Aren't you just too cool?</font>

235
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,960
<font color="yellow">What's so cool about me?</font>

236
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,430
<font color="yellow">You found a person you love.</font>

237
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,960
<font color="yellow">You're trying to protect that love.
You're the cool one here.</font>

238
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,530
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you know this already.
Seo Woo's a bit mentally weak.</font>

239
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,440
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

240
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,150
<font color="yellow">Wow! This looks just like them.</font>

241
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,080
<font color="yellow">"As usual, this is the best."</font>

242
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,230
<font color="yellow">KJ says, "It's boring. Get lost."
This crazy punk.</font>

243
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,080
<font color="yellow">People don't seem to like it.</font>

244
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,990
<font color="yellow">KJ says it's boring.</font>

245
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,470
<font color="yellow">I think I know this KJ.</font>

246
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,000
<font color="yellow">He keeps coming around
and posting this nonsense.</font>

247
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,280
<font color="yellow">Is it you, Chief? KJ.</font>

248
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,690
<font color="yellow">- Kyung Joon.
- No.</font>

249
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,870
<font color="yellow">It really isn't me.</font>

250
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,800
<font color="yellow">Am I the only KJ?</font>

251
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,320
<font color="yellow">Kwang Joo, Kyung Joo, Kook Ja,
or like Kyung Joon...</font>

252
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,780
<font color="yellow">Oh! Kyung Joon.</font>

253
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,810
<font color="yellow">Wow, you just outed yourself.</font>

254
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,860
<font color="yellow">Fine, it was me.</font>

255
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,810
<font color="yellow">How did you know?
Is it very obvious?</font>

256
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,480
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why are you doing that?</font>

257
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,000
<font color="yellow">You're just doing so well.
I'm worried you'll become a writer.</font>

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,700
<font color="yellow">Gosh, really.</font>

259
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,610
<font color="yellow">I like webtoons. They're a hobby.
My dream is to be a surgeon.</font>

260
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,080
<font color="yellow">Stop worrying about useless things
and don't do things like this.</font>

261
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,450
<font color="yellow">Okay, okay.</font>

262
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,920
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

263
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,190
<font color="yellow">Kang Soo.</font>

264
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,710
<font color="yellow">What about the seizures?</font>

265
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,940
<font color="yellow">They are...</font>

266
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,900
<font color="yellow">gone now that I took medication.</font>

267
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,500
<font color="yellow">- What a relief.
- You're checking diligently.</font>

268
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,980
<font color="yellow">Are you doing that for all patients?</font>

269
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

270
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,060
<font color="yellow">You know that the director
is in the VIP room, right?</font>

271
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, I made the call from the ER.</font>

272
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,440
<font color="yellow">You sure are good at answering.</font>

273
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,440
<font color="yellow">Will the director be able
to stay in his position?</font>

274
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,840
<font color="yellow">He'll probably get fired
once there is a new board director.</font>

275
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,500
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have that connection anymore.</font>

276
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,350
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

277
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,130
<font color="yellow">What? Were you gossiping again?</font>

278
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,850
<font color="yellow">You went quiet when I came in,
so I guess you were.</font>

279
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,090
<font color="yellow">No, we weren't.</font>

280
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,290
<font color="yellow">Where's Young Gook?</font>

281
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,310
<font color="yellow">He's in the on-call room.</font>

282
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,430
<font color="yellow">Young Gook.</font>

283
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,210
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

284
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,640
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

285
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,490
<font color="yellow">So why would you come looking for me?
You should go eat.</font>

286
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,930
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

287
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,720
<font color="yellow">Why did I come to you when I'm hungry?</font>

288
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,010
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

289
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,770
<font color="yellow">Stay put. I'm not going to attack you.</font>

290
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,300
<font color="yellow">You're barely even eating.
Why did you say you were hungry?</font>

291
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,290
<font color="yellow">Why did you just leave earlier?</font>

292
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,330
<font color="yellow">It seemed like you were
talking with Senior Yoon Do.</font>

293
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,910
<font color="yellow">He was just returning the favor.</font>

294
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,630
<font color="yellow">- When he used to get dumped--
- You don't need to explain.</font>

295
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
<font color="yellow">Is there anything about you
that I don't know?</font>

296
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,190
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here.</font>

297
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,800
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo.</font>

298
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,990
<font color="yellow">As I've always been, I'm by your side.</font>

299
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,090
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

300
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,550
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

301
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,800
<font color="yellow">I think you've always been
there by my side.</font>

302
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,630
<font color="yellow">But what do I do now?</font>

303
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,580
<font color="yellow">I've changed now.</font>

304
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,400
<font color="yellow">I think it was ever since then.</font>

305
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,700
<font color="yellow">When I first did that bad thing to you...</font>

306
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,760
<font color="yellow">Since then...</font>

307
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,950
<font color="yellow">you came rushing into my heart.</font>

308
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,820
<font color="yellow">I don't really know
when you came into my heart.</font>

309
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,270
<font color="yellow">But when I heard about my dad...</font>

310
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,230
<font color="yellow">the first thing I thought was that
I wanted to be comforted by you.</font>

311
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,230
<font color="yellow">Everything...</font>

312
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,420
<font color="yellow">will be okay.</font>

313
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,910
<font color="yellow">I know it's late, but congratulations
on coming back to work.</font>

314
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,950
<font color="yellow">What is all of this?</font>

315
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
<font color="yellow">I bought them at the hospital store.
Take them home with you.</font>

316
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,950
<font color="yellow">I'm usually single-minded.</font>

317
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,850
<font color="yellow">I've decided to change that.
I'm going to do multiple things at once.</font>

318
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,040
<font color="yellow">- You're testing it out on me?
- Yes.</font>

319
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,520
<font color="yellow">Taking care of you and being a surgeon.</font>

320
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,970
<font color="yellow">Being a great friend to Soon Hee.</font>

321
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,840
<font color="yellow">Being a good senior
to the department people.</font>

322
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,240
<font color="yellow">Can you do all of that?</font>

323
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,170
<font color="yellow">I won't be doing Director Jin's surgery.</font>

324
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,320
<font color="yellow">To summarize,
Director Jin's surgery is on your mind.</font>

325
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,160
<font color="yellow">All your thoughts are on that,
so you want to keep yourself busy.</font>

326
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,580
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

327
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,880
<font color="yellow">Because I'm your man.</font>

328
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,130
<font color="yellow">You say all the answers I want to hear.</font>

329
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,250
<font color="yellow">If you don't go in,
I can't do that surgery either.</font>

330
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,870
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

331
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,990
<font color="yellow">I don't have the confidence.</font>

332
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,890
<font color="yellow">You have things
you're not confident about?</font>

333
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,820
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a very difficult surgery.</font>

334
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,630
<font color="yellow">It's emotionally burdensome and risky.</font>

335
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:22,110
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that the patient
will suffer from that risk.</font>

336
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,840
<font color="yellow">I haven't been able to
forgive Director Jin.</font>

337
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,160
<font color="yellow">That's why I can't do it.</font>

338
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,970
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the ICU. I'm sorry.</font>

340
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,650
<font color="yellow">How is she?</font>

341
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,080
<font color="yellow">Her BST was 250, so I gave her insulin.</font>

342
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,130
<font color="yellow">Her cortisol levels are a little high.</font>

343
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,480
<font color="yellow">What do the obstetricians say?</font>

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,310
<font color="yellow">They say it could be temporary,
so we should just check on her.</font>

345
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

346
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,450
<font color="yellow">I'm very sorry.</font>

347
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,110
<font color="yellow">I made this decision for
your benefit, not for mine.</font>

348
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,160
<font color="yellow">How can not operating on me
be for my benefit?</font>

349
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,500
<font color="yellow">Do you think I asked you to
operate on me because I like you?</font>

350
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,590
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

351
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,900
<font color="yellow">We are looking into other surgeons.</font>

352
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,970
<font color="yellow">You can't come in this month?</font>

353
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,510
<font color="yellow">It won't be good to delay this.</font>

354
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,790
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

355
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,050
<font color="yellow">Then find out when Professor Song
is coming back from the U.S.</font>

356
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

357
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,470
<font color="yellow">Professor Lee Sung Min can't do it?</font>

358
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,380
<font color="yellow">No, and Professor Song Man Soo
is off studying right now.</font>

359
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,130
<font color="yellow">Professor Song Hye Jin.</font>

360
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,280
<font color="yellow">She got into a fight with Director Jin
and left the hospital.</font>

361
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,780
<font color="yellow">That won't work either.</font>

362
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,280
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

363
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,580
<font color="yellow">Can't you do it, Doctor?</font>

364
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,230
<font color="yellow">I have to perform the duties
of the director right now.</font>

365
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,290
<font color="yellow">And I've been handling management duties</font>

366
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,230
<font color="yellow">so my hands are not what they used to be.</font>

367
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

368
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,270
<font color="yellow">Does it make sense that he can't operate
because Hye Jung won't do it?</font>

369
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,570
<font color="yellow">He can just say he doesn't want to do it.
What kind of excuse is that?</font>

370
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,960
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

371
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,360
<font color="yellow">The two of them have rarely
failed in surgery together.</font>

372
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,590
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung is a skilled surgeon.</font>

373
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,850
<font color="yellow">Why do you care who is assisting?
It's the surgeon who's important.</font>

374
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,670
<font color="yellow">The assisting surgeon is important.</font>

375
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,450
<font color="yellow">No matter what the surgery,
a small mistake can make it go wrong.</font>

376
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,340
<font color="yellow">She is really detailed about her work.
So is Doctor Hong.</font>

377
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:49,070
<font color="yellow">Getting the two of them to operate
is the best thing for you, Dad.</font>

378
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,510
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Kim Tae Ho is
looking into other surgeons.</font>

379
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,310
<font color="yellow">I can get it from someone else.</font>

380
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,930
<font color="yellow">What brings you by this late?</font>

381
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,460
<font color="yellow">I wondered what you thought about
postponing the surgery date.</font>

382
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,820
<font color="yellow">It's hard to find anyone who can
operate on your schedule.</font>

383
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,450
<font color="yellow">Did you even look properly?</font>

384
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,470
<font color="yellow">I understand you're feeling sensitive,
but please don't cross the line.</font>

385
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,260
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you want me to die.</font>

386
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,390
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- It's all right.</font>

387
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,870
<font color="yellow">We'll talk again later.</font>

388
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,580
<font color="yellow">Do you need something to help you sleep?</font>

389
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,350
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. I can sleep well.</font>

390
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,860
<font color="yellow">This is so upsetting.
How did things get this way?</font>

391
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,990
<font color="yellow">Why do bad things happen all at once?</font>

392
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,400
<font color="yellow">Father-in-law has to be questioned by
the prosecutors the day after tomorrow.</font>

393
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,270
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep talking? It's noisy.</font>

394
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,880
<font color="yellow">Go home if you're
going to be bothersome.</font>

395
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,110
<font color="yellow">Can't I even talk?
You get annoyed whenever I talk.</font>

396
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,350
<font color="yellow">Can't you stay quiet?</font>

397
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,580
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

398
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,680
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

399
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,420
<font color="yellow"><i>[JIN SEO WOO]</i></font>

400
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,530
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

401
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,710
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

402
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,350
<font color="yellow">Can we meet now?</font>

403
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to come so late.</font>

404
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,250
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Sit down.</font>

405
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,210
<font color="yellow">So, you live here with Soon Hee.</font>

406
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,890
<font color="yellow">- Where's Soon Hee?
- She'll be here soon.</font>

407
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,640
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay with herbal tea?
- Yes.</font>

408
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,270
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung.</font>

409
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,210
<font color="yellow">About my dad's surgery,
can you come in and assist?</font>

410
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,790
<font color="yellow">Doctor Hong says he won't do it,
so we're looking for another doctor.</font>

411
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,490
<font color="yellow">It's not working out well.</font>

412
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,560
<font color="yellow">Your father won't like it.</font>

413
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,410
<font color="yellow">I can persuade my dad.</font>

414
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:57,980
<font color="yellow">You should try talking to Doctor Hong.</font>

415
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,840
<font color="yellow">Kyung Joon or Young Gook can assist.</font>

416
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,810
<font color="yellow">Can you do it?</font>

417
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,710
<font color="yellow">I feel like that's what would
make me feel at ease.</font>

418
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

419
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,160
<font color="yellow">Please, I'm asking you.</font>

420
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,570
<font color="yellow">Why are you alone?</font>

421
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,250
<font color="yellow">I sent them all away
because they were irritating me.</font>

422
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,110
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

423
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,880
<font color="yellow">This is when you need
your family more than anything.</font>

424
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you here so late?</font>

425
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,220
<font color="yellow">I kept trying to come.</font>

426
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,060
<font color="yellow">My heart felt weak and my
body felt weak. I couldn't come.</font>

427
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,140
<font color="yellow">My child is sick. How could I be okay?</font>

428
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,800
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep.</font>

429
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,480
<font color="yellow">Dad...</font>

430
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,460
<font color="yellow">How did such an awful thing
grow inside of you?</font>

431
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,640
<font color="yellow">Even if I get surgery,
I won't be able to live like before.</font>

432
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,600
<font color="yellow">I might not be able to walk and
I might not be able to talk.</font>

433
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,520
<font color="yellow">I'm scared to death.</font>

434
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,940
<font color="yellow">You just need to live.</font>

435
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,230
<font color="yellow">You can become used to
the other discomforts.</font>

436
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,480
<font color="yellow">Don't think about that stuff.</font>

437
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,140
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking I'm going to die!
I think I'm going to die during surgery.</font>

438
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,200
<font color="yellow">I don't want to die, Dad!</font>

439
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,060
<font color="yellow">You're not going to die!</font>

440
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,010
<font color="yellow">How can you say that
in front of your father?</font>

441
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,270
<font color="yellow">You... will not die.</font>

442
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,040
<font color="yellow">Your dad will not let you die!</font>

443
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,460
<font color="yellow"><i>My doctor knows what he is doing.</i></font>

444
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,490
<font color="yellow">My doctor is good looking and smart.</font>

445
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,350
<font color="yellow">I trust my doctor.</font>

446
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,350
<font color="yellow">Yes, Kyung Joon.</font>

447
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,010
<font color="yellow">Director Jin Myung Hoon is
complaining about headaches.</font>

448
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,850
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

449
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,250
<font color="yellow">He didn't take any medication
or food that would cause this.</font>

450
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,500
<font color="yellow">Where and how severe is the head pain?</font>

451
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,200
<font color="yellow">It's everywhere and I feel like
my head is going to explode.</font>

452
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,980
<font color="yellow">Just in case, let's take another CT.
Give him some painkillers quickly.</font>

453
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,050
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

454
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,500
<font color="yellow">Tell me if there's anything else wrong.</font>

455
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,100
<font color="yellow">You're not even going to do my surgery.</font>

456
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,010
<font color="yellow">Tell Yoon Do to take charge
until I get a surgery date.</font>

457
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,960
<font color="yellow">We can't do that according
to the hospital rules.</font>

458
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,380
<font color="yellow">I will take responsibility for you
until your surgery.</font>

459
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,460
<font color="yellow">Stop dangling a mouse
in front a cat and just leave.</font>

460
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,560
<font color="yellow">You're just leaving me to die.</font>

461
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

462
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,840
<font color="yellow">Oh! Pretty Doctor Yoo, whom I respect.</font>

463
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
<font color="yellow">- Hello, there.
- Coming from somewhere?</font>

464
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,770
<font color="yellow">Running errands.
Just doing my job as secretary.</font>

465
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,850
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

466
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,880
<font color="yellow">Which floor? The station?</font>

467
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,970
<font color="yellow">- No, the VIP floor.
- Okay.</font>

468
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,200
<font color="yellow">Why are you going there?</font>

469
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,770
<font color="yellow">Do I have to report that to you?</font>

470
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,160
<font color="yellow">No, have a good visit there.</font>

471
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
<font color="yellow">What brings you up here?</font>

472
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,200
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see the director.</font>

473
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,820
<font color="yellow">If the director wants it,
I will assist you in the surgery.</font>

474
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,360
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

475
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,710
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor.</font>

476
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,420
<font color="yellow">I should do it if the patient wants it.</font>

477
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,540
<font color="yellow">You made a good decision.</font>

478
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,830
<font color="yellow">I might get rejected.
I made the decision to do it, though.</font>

479
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,380
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

480
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

481
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,750
<font color="yellow">I want to assist in your surgery.</font>

482
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

483
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,030
<font color="yellow">I will go into your surgery, do my best,
and help the lead surgeon.</font>

484
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,670
<font color="yellow">Leave out the part about doing your best.</font>

485
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,660
<font color="yellow">Don't make fun of me.</font>

486
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,960
<font color="yellow">You're going to cut one of my
blood vessels during surgery, right?</font>

487
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,130
<font color="yellow">Then say that you did your best?</font>

488
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,880
<font color="yellow">Why would you think that?</font>

489
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,490
<font color="yellow">I'm going crazy right now.</font>

490
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,930
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm getting what I deserve
because this happened?</font>

491
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,080
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do think you are.</font>

492
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,740
<font color="yellow">I haven't done anything wrong.</font>

493
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,970
<font color="yellow">I looked at the MRI and CT again.</font>

494
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,020
<font color="yellow">The tumor is inside the spinal cord</font>

495
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,670
<font color="yellow">so we'll have to
open the posterior column.</font>

496
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,700
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

497
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,260
<font color="yellow">When we open it up...</font>

498
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,530
<font color="yellow">I will do what I can to avoid
causing damage to the area.</font>

499
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,490
<font color="yellow">You do seem to have skills.</font>

500
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,380
<font color="yellow">I found that out...</font>

501
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,370
<font color="yellow">when I was digging into your past.</font>

502
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,730
<font color="yellow">Do you know what my grandma said
to me before she went into surgery?</font>

503
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,950
<font color="yellow">"My doctor knows what he is doing."</font>

504
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,010
<font color="yellow">"I trust my doctor."</font>

505
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,750
<font color="yellow">I thought about it.</font>

506
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,580
<font color="yellow">I think my grandma's last moments
were peaceful, at least.</font>

507
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,640
<font color="yellow">Because she trusted you.</font>

508
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,320
<font color="yellow">She trusted that she would wake up.</font>

509
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,190
<font color="yellow">She thought she would
live a healthy life.</font>

510
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,880
<font color="yellow">Before the surgery...</font>

511
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,290
<font color="yellow">you made her feel she could trust you
and feel safe going into her surgery.</font>

512
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,570
<font color="yellow">Thank you for that.</font>

513
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,130
<font color="yellow">You were originally my patient.</font>

514
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,230
<font color="yellow">You need this surgery
and I want to save you.</font>

515
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,660
<font color="yellow">I want to save you.</font>

516
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,570
<font color="yellow">And I want to hear you say "Thank you."</font>

517
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,540
<font color="yellow">I will be going now.</font>

518
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,540
<font color="yellow">You tell Professor Hong Ji Hong.</font>

519
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,120
<font color="yellow">Schedule the surgery as soon as possible.</font>

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,790
<font color="yellow">Self-retaining retractor.</font>

522
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:47,150
<font color="yellow">This surgery requires the spinal cord
to be opened because the tumor is inside.</font>

523
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,770
<font color="yellow">It is extremely difficult.</font>

524
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,620
<font color="yellow">It's a dangerous surgery
that could cause paralysis, right?</font>

525
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,560
<font color="yellow">Yes. Do you understand, Joong Dae?</font>

526
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,930
<font color="yellow">I will study it.</font>

527
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,990
<font color="yellow">Gown, please.</font>

528
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,710
<font color="yellow">Cutter, please.</font>

529
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,670
<font color="yellow">Let's get started.</font>

530
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,450
<font color="yellow">Irrigation, please.</font>

531
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,950
<font color="yellow">Rinse it here.</font>

532
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,840
<font color="yellow">They've cut the backbone
of C2 to C5, right?</font>

533
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

534
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,360
<font color="yellow">Don't go near the inner part
of the vertebral artery.</font>

535
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,280
<font color="yellow">Bipolars.</font>

536
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,450
<font color="yellow">They're getting in okay.</font>

537
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,730
<font color="yellow">They've barely touched it so far.</font>

538
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,060
<font color="yellow">It's really stuck on there.</font>

539
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,350
<font color="yellow">I see that.</font>

540
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,360
<font color="yellow">The tumor is on the underside
of the spinal cord.</font>

541
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,990
<font color="yellow">It looks like they will have to touch
the nerves to remove the tumor.</font>

542
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,610
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I got Hong Ji Hong
to do this surgery to avoid that.</font>

543
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,240
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

544
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,840
<font color="yellow">They've removed it.</font>

545
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, they've done it.</font>

546
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,920
<font color="yellow">There's bleeding.</font>

547
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,480
<font color="yellow">It was unavoidable because the tumor
was adhered so tightly to the spine.</font>

548
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,510
<font color="yellow">They have to fix that.</font>

549
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,870
<font color="yellow">Bring me cottonoid.</font>

550
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,320
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

551
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,430
<font color="yellow">I see it. Let me finish this.</font>

552
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,560
<font color="yellow">Biopsy.</font>

553
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,510
<font color="yellow">The bleeding isn't stopping.</font>

554
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,520
<font color="yellow">His nerves are getting damaged.</font>

555
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,950
<font color="yellow">Cottonoid.</font>

556
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,640
<font color="yellow">What if he wakes up and can't move?</font>

557
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,130
<font color="yellow">Why isn't the bleeding stopping?</font>

558
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:57,550
<font color="yellow">Let's just watch, kids.</font>

559
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,260
<font color="yellow">Doctor, the signal is strange.</font>

560
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,960
<font color="yellow">We have to do something.
I have to stop the bleeding.</font>

561
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,080
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

562
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,710
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

563
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,400
<font color="yellow">They got it.</font>

564
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,020
<font color="yellow">They finished a very hard surgery.</font>

565
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,880
<font color="yellow">Good work, Doctor Yoo.</font>

566
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,650
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

567
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,050
<font color="yellow">The director lived. Let's finish up.</font>

568
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,780
<font color="yellow">The surgery went well.</font>

569
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,740
<font color="yellow">The tumor was removed.</font>

570
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,840
<font color="yellow">There was damage to some nerves.</font>

571
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,780
<font color="yellow">We won't know anything for sure
until he wakes up.</font>

572
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,400
<font color="yellow">We'll move him into his room.</font>

573
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,110
<font color="yellow">Thanks. Thank you, Doctor.</font>

574
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,430
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

575
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,670
<font color="yellow">Bye, then.</font>

576
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,110
<font color="yellow">He survived.</font>

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480

581
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,530

582
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,650
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

583
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,610
<font color="yellow">- Doctor! Have this.
- What's this?</font>

584
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,070
<font color="yellow">Iced Americano. Kang Soo bought it.</font>

585
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,750
<font color="yellow">Doctor, it really feels like our
department again because you're back.</font>

586
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,240
<font color="yellow">Now that the director's surgery went well</font>

587
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,960
<font color="yellow">let's go out for welcome-back drinks!</font>

588
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,250
<font color="yellow">It's not like
I just started working here.</font>

589
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,960
<font color="yellow">Professor, we're all feeling down lately.</font>

590

<font color="yellow">Ah! Doctor Yoo can come too.</font>

592
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,420
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we can all go if she comes, right?</font>

593
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,450
<font color="yellow">We can all go if I go? Where?</font>

594
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,290
<font color="yellow">We all want to go for a beer.</font>

595
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,510
<font color="yellow">- Chief, you can't go.
- Why?</font>

596
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,360
<font color="yellow">You're on-call.</font>

597
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,580
<font color="yellow">Gosh, no!</font>

598
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,380
<font color="yellow">- Then, should we go for a drink?
- Yes!</font>

599
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,370
