00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,340
<font color="yellow">I can't do it anymore.</font>

5
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,270
<font color="yellow">Look at the stars.</font>

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,010
<font color="yellow">They're so beautiful.</font>

7
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,350
<font color="yellow">- Hye Jung.
- Yes?</font>

8
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,420
<font color="yellow">My arm is long, right?</font>

9
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,940
<font color="yellow">You can use my arm.</font>

10
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,820
<font color="yellow">That line gave me goosebumps.</font>

I find myself falling asleep.</i></font>

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,260
<font color="yellow">Open this for me.</font>

16
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,320
<font color="yellow">That's enough drinking.</font>

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,500
<font color="yellow">- Open it for me.
- Stop drinking. You've had enough.</font>

18
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,360
<font color="yellow">Hey, aren't you going to leave?</font>

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,270
<font color="yellow">I have to close up now.</font>

20
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,930
<font color="yellow">You came here so late and
now you won't go.</font>

21
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,990
<font color="yellow">This is all because of you.</font>

22
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,320
<font color="yellow">All right. I'm sorry.</font>

23
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,930
<font color="yellow">What's with you?
Are you being sarcastic right now?</font>

24
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,880
<font color="yellow">She's making sarcastic remarks at me.</font>

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,900
<font color="yellow">Hey, be careful.</font>

26
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,950
<font color="yellow">Will you please do something about her?</font>

27
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,950
<font color="yellow">I've never seen her so drunk before,
so I don't know what to do.</font>

28
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,410
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my head.
- Here.</font>

29
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,520
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's get going now.</font>

30
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,600
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- No, I'm not leaving.</font>

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,750
<font color="yellow">I'm going to blow this place up.</font>

32
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,850
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

33
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,600
<font color="yellow">This is all your fault.</font>

34
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,010
<font color="yellow">If you hadn't brought Hye Jung around</font>

35
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,740
<font color="yellow">this wouldn't have happened in my life.</font>

36
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,590
<font color="yellow">Put this down and let's go now.</font>

37
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,280
<font color="yellow">If you want blow this place up,
do it tomorrow.</font>

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,310
<font color="yellow">Let's get going, okay?</font>

39
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,980
<font color="yellow">You have to buy some bombs too.</font>

40
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,470
<font color="yellow">- This is all your fault.
- Let's go.</font>

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,960
<font color="yellow">Go to the hardware store
and buy some bombs.</font>

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,150
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

43
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that girl is such a nuisance.</font>

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
<font color="yellow">- Seriously...
- 22!</font>

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, you scared me!</font>

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,300
<font color="yellow">Who are you, Mister?</font>

47
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,440
<font color="yellow">I'm Ahn Joong Dae.</font>

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,320
<font color="yellow">Seriously. what are you saying
you're going to "give me"?</font>

49
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,030
<font color="yellow">Is everyone gone?</font>

50
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, they're gone. Now, go!</font>

51
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,420
<font color="yellow">Why was I the only one left behind?</font>

52
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,030
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Do you have ramen here?</font>

53
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,640
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry after taking a nap.</font>

54
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,420
<font color="yellow">I'm not giving you any, Ahn Joong Dae!</font>

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,970
<font color="yellow">You little punk, seriously.
Do you know what you put us through?</font>

56
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,030
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

57
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,140
<font color="yellow">What do you think it is?
It's glucose. What do you think?</font>

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,010
<font color="yellow">You said you had a
high alcohol tolerance.</font>

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,030
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie?</font>

60
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,060
<font color="yellow">- Oh, did I pass out?
- We're talking about your life here.</font>

61
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,140
<font color="yellow">It only ended well because Joong Dae
brought the intubation kit.</font>

62
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,140
<font color="yellow">If he didn't, who knows...</font>

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,190
<font color="yellow">- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm sick.</font>

64
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,770
<font color="yellow">Let me sleep when I'm sick.</font>

65
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,840
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, you punk!
- Wait, look.</font>

66
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,180
<font color="yellow">All right, rest.</font>

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,950
<font color="yellow">Why is he suddenly acting that way?</font>

68
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,890
<font color="yellow">Your arm hurts because of me,
doesn't it?</font>

69
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,200
<font color="yellow">No, I'm just rotating it.</font>

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,780
<font color="yellow">Is your arm really okay?
My head was really heavy, right?</font>

71
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,770
<font color="yellow">Was that your head?
I thought it was a feather.</font>

72
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,950
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.
I haven't slept so well in a long time.</font>

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,390
<font color="yellow">Are you just getting home now?</font>

74
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,720
<font color="yellow">Aren't you getting in too late?</font>

75
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,990
<font color="yellow">You sounds like the
school principal or something.</font>

76
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,860
<font color="yellow">Teacher, I am her guardian.</font>

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,570
<font color="yellow">There are many weird people these days.</font>

78
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,660
<font color="yellow">When it was raining last time</font>

79
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,520
<font color="yellow">I heard a crazy girl and guy
were dancing in the park.</font>

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,780
<font color="yellow">What if our Hye Jung happens to run into
one of those strange people?</font>

81
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,150
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

82
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,570
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

83
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,830
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

84
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,280
<font color="yellow">- Bye!
- Yeah, bye.</font>

85
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,120
<font color="yellow">I suppose anyone who runs into
Hye Jung would be unlucky.</font>

86
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait for me!</font>

87
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,650
<font color="yellow">Ah, I'm so tired.</font>

88
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,490
<font color="yellow">How come you finished up so late today?</font>

89
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,230
<font color="yellow">It's way past the store's closing time.</font>

90
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,560
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo showed up
and caused a scene again.</font>

91
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,990
<font color="yellow">She didn't show up for the party.
I guess she came late.</font>

92
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,540
<font color="yellow">She got very drunk and left.
That doctor Young Gook took her.</font>

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,460
<font color="yellow">He seems very nice.</font>

94
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,970
<font color="yellow">He's tall and good looking.</font>

95
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,440
<font color="yellow">Young Gook is your type, isn't he?</font>

96
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,570
<font color="yellow">Did you notice?</font>

97
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, I noticed.</font>

98
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,620
<font color="yellow">You should bring him by often.</font>

99
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,200
<font color="yellow">You're not going be the
only one dating, are you?</font>

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,350
<font color="yellow">Now that you're dating,
I want to date too.</font>

101
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,200
<font color="yellow">Is this what dating is?</font>

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,900
<font color="yellow">Oh, you know that tall guy
who came at the end?</font>

103
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,510
<font color="yellow">You know that guy who looks sort of
like a Siberian husky dog?</font>

104
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,700
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung Yoon Do.</font>

105
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,320
<font color="yellow">His name is Jung Yoon Do?</font>

106
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,430
<font color="yellow">He was a little bit strange.</font>

107
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,410
<font color="yellow">He was staring at you and
Teacher Hong the entire time.</font>

108
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,730
<font color="yellow">Which of you does he like?</font>

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,390
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bet 500 won
that he likes you.</font>

110
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,080
<font color="yellow">You're just getting back now?</font>

111
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,930
<font color="yellow">You seem upset that I'm coming back now.</font>

112
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,590
<font color="yellow">What are you doing this late
instead of sleeping?</font>

113
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,430
<font color="yellow">I had some things to think about.</font>

114
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,860
<font color="yellow">- So, are you done thinking?
- Yes.</font>

115
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,180
<font color="yellow">Doctor, I like Doctor Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,100
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me that?</font>

117
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,630
<font color="yellow">I heard that you and Doctor Yoo Hye Jung
have a special relationship.</font>

118
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,040
<font color="yellow">Though a special relationship is
different than being in love.</font>

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,380
<font color="yellow">I've heard that you've only recently been
in a relationship as a man and woman.</font>

120
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,750
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

121
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,350
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'm overthinking things.</font>

122
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,120
<font color="yellow">You two are not married yet.</font>

123
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,610
<font color="yellow">So, I believe I still have
a right to pursue Hye Jung.</font>

124
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,040
<font color="yellow">- Does Hye Jung know this too?
- Of course, she knows.</font>

125
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,050
<font color="yellow">Would I tell you first without
telling the woman I like?</font>

126
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,240
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

127
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,250
<font color="yellow">So, why are you telling me all of this?</font>

128
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,200
<font color="yellow">I really hate to stab people in the back.</font>

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,320
<font color="yellow">Since I know you two have
some sort of relationship</font>

130
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,180
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be the kind of person
to scheme and take her away.</font>

131
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,560
<font color="yellow">How do you plan on taking her away?
Did I say I'd let you?</font>

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I like it.</font>

133
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,430
<font color="yellow">You're very manly.</font>

134
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,570
<font color="yellow">A man should be this way.</font>

135
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,830
<font color="yellow">But, just so you know...</font>

136
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,010
<font color="yellow">I've never lost something
I've wanted before.</font>

137
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,530
<font color="yellow">I'm happy you recognize all of
Hye Jung's charms.</font>

138
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,790
<font color="yellow">I'm glad Hye Jung knows just
how popular she is with men.</font>

139
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,220
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

140
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,810
<font color="yellow">Aren't you worried about me at all?</font>

141
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,910
<font color="yellow">Why would I be?</font>

142
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,270
<font color="yellow">You're going to help Hye Jung and me
realize how strong our relationship is.</font>

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,400
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

144
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,620
<font color="yellow">Good luck with the fight.</font>

145
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,800
<font color="yellow">Wow, he puts up a good front.
What's with that overconfidence?</font>

146
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,330
<font color="yellow">You never know with men and women
until they enter the wedding hall!</font>

147
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,260
<font color="yellow">What is this? I feel like I've lost
when it hasn't started yet.</font>

148
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,000
<font color="yellow"><i>That's so cute.</i></font>

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440

159
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,780
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I can't give you
the records for Kang Mal Soon.</font>

160
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,350
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

161
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,420
<font color="yellow">We destroy files that are
over 10 years old.</font>

162
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,650
<font color="yellow">It's gone now.</font>

163
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,780
<font color="yellow">This is Gookil Hospital admissions.</font>

164
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,080
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Doctor Kim Chi Hyun,
who was a resident 13 years ago, is now?</font>

165
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,460
<font color="yellow">Do you mean Section Chief Kim Chi Hyun?</font>

166
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,520
<font color="yellow">We're not seeing patients yet.</font>

167
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,710
<font color="yellow">I'm a junior of Doctor Kim Chi Hyun.
I wanted to drop by.</font>

168
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,410
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

169
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,630
<font color="yellow">You were a surgical resident 13 years ago
at this hospital, right?</font>

170
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,280
<font color="yellow">Has it been 13 years already?</font>

171
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,240
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,850
<font color="yellow">I was a patient's guardian back then.</font>

173
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,680
<font color="yellow">But it wouldn't have been me back then.</font>

174
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,220
<font color="yellow">The section chief would've been
the one giving treatment.</font>

175
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,280
<font color="yellow">It was you who filled out
the paperwork, wasn't it?</font>

176
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,270
<font color="yellow">Who, exactly, are you?</font>

177
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so sensitive?</font>

178
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,330
<font color="yellow">If you wanted to ask this,
you should've put in an official request.</font>

179
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,490
<font color="yellow">What the heck is this?</font>

180
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,430
<font color="yellow">If I put in an official request,
would you have even met me?</font>

181
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,310
<font color="yellow">I did not lead that surgery.</font>

182
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,170
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming to me about this?</font>

183
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,560
<font color="yellow">You were a physician
and you filled out her chart.</font>

184
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,280
<font color="yellow">I want to know everything that happened
that day in the operating room.</font>

185
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,730
<font color="yellow">How can I remember something
that happened 13 years ago?</font>

186
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,370
<font color="yellow">I performed so many surgeries.</font>

187
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,160
<font color="yellow">Many patients die during surgery.</font>

188
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,650
<font color="yellow">Even if you can't remember,
force yourself to remember.</font>

189
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,510
<font color="yellow">This surgery from 13 years ago
may have been insignificant to you.</font>

190
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,950
<font color="yellow">But some people have thought about it
every single day since.</font>

191
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
<font color="yellow">You can't sue even if you find anything.</font>

192
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,100
<font color="yellow">The statute of limitations on this
is 10 years and it's too late.</font>

193
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,220
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

194
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,030
<font color="yellow">Even if there was an error,
a legal punishment is difficult.</font>

195
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,480
<font color="yellow">However, legal punishments are not
the only kind of punishment.</font>

196
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,070
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want?</font>

197
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,860
<font color="yellow">An apology, the truth...</font>

198
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,670
<font color="yellow">To make people pay.</font>

199
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,080
<font color="yellow">These are the rules that any
healthy society should abide by.</font>

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,310
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I have nothing to do
with this surgery.</font>

201
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,910
<font color="yellow">I was not the lead.
Sorry. I'm busy.</font>

202
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,570
<font color="yellow">I'll leave this here.
Think about it carefully.</font>

203
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,110
<font color="yellow">Call me.</font>

204
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,130
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

205
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,680
<font color="yellow">I want to look more bright.
Can you choose a color for me?</font>

206
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,960
<font color="yellow">Sure, I'll pick out some tints for you.</font>

207
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,010
<font color="yellow">You must be going to meet your boyfriend.</font>

208
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, no.</font>

209
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,200
<font color="yellow">Then a person you're flirting with?</font>

210
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,130
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting my grandma.
She likes pretty things.</font>

211
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,510
<font color="yellow">I envy you. My grandma passed away.</font>

212
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,600
<font color="yellow">I'll give you lots of samples.
Give them to your grandmother.</font>

213
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,140
<font color="yellow">Grandma, do you like the flowers?</font>

214
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,900
<font color="yellow">You like small and pretty things.</font>

215
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,570
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you'd like these.</font>

216
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,940
<font color="yellow">Well, I suppose it's okay
as long as I like them.</font>

217
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,430
<font color="yellow">When you bought me my necklace...</font>

218
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,990
<font color="yellow">you said you'd be
the one looking at it.</font>

219
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,550
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I haven't forgotten.</font>

220
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,210
<font color="yellow">That life of yours that you loved
until the very end...</font>

221
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,870
<font color="yellow">I won't ever forget your life.</font>

222
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,620
<font color="yellow">Why do I keep talking to myself?
Just like you always did.</font>

223
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,840
<font color="yellow">I really miss you.</font>

224
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,310
<font color="yellow">Don't get hung up on a guy.</font>

225
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,310
<font color="yellow">No one will love you
as much as your dad.</font>

226
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,900
<font color="yellow">Yoon Do has no manners
to treat elders like that.</font>

227
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,180
<font color="yellow">If it weren't for his father,
I wouldn't have let him be.</font>

228
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,490
<font color="yellow">Don't drive him away though.</font>

229
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,810
<font color="yellow">Men are weak to women who wait for them.</font>

230
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,250
<font color="yellow">Pretend to wait for him.</font>

231
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,540
<font color="yellow">How can I pretend?</font>

232
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,450
<font color="yellow">Business is about moving
people's hearts by pretending.</font>

233
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,670
<font color="yellow">I'm a doctor.</font>

234
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,570
<font color="yellow">You're a doctor who knows business.</font>

235
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,640
<font color="yellow">Don't focus only on one thing
and be more flexible.</font>

236
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,560
<font color="yellow">Hi. Morning.</font>

237
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,290
<font color="yellow">How much do you hate fishing
that you need my help?</font>

238
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,870
<font color="yellow">I don't hate it. It's just boring.</font>

239
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,590
<font color="yellow">I do want to spend time
with my dad though.</font>

240
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,320
<font color="yellow">If you're with me, the problem is solved.</font>

241
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,160
<font color="yellow">My dad must be here.</font>

242
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,010
<font color="yellow">- Should we get out?
- Yes.</font>

243
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,550
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

244
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,240
<font color="yellow">This is my junior.</font>

245
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,090
<font color="yellow">Hello, my name is Yoo Hye Jung.</font>

246
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,290
<font color="yellow">Yoo Hye Jung?</font>

247
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,030
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung? I think I've heard that name.</font>

248
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,940
<font color="yellow">Is she that person who called
when we were fishing before?</font>

249
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,740
<font color="yellow">Wow, you remember that?</font>

250
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,030
<font color="yellow">Come this way. Let's walk together.</font>

251
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, okay.</font>

252
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,470
<font color="yellow">What do you like about my Ji Hong?</font>

253
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,360
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
- Dad, why are you saying that?</font>

254
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,660
<font color="yellow">I'll say whatever I want.</font>

255
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,060
<font color="yellow">- Grandpa!
- Hello.</font>

256
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,310
<font color="yellow">Dad, you're here early.</font>

257
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,300
<font color="yellow">Oh, I finished golfing early.</font>

258
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,200
<font color="yellow">I wanted to show you
something great, Seo Woo.</font>

259
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,370
<font color="yellow">This is the place our dreams will start.</font>

260
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,240
<font color="yellow">Gookil Medical Corporation.</font>

261
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,870
<font color="yellow">We still have a long way to go.</font>

262
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,780
<font color="yellow">No, starting it up is half of it.</font>

263
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,430
<font color="yellow">Your father and I are on it.</font>

264
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,760
<font color="yellow">You only need to
reap the fruits, all right?</font>

265
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

266
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,910
<font color="yellow">I will live for the three of us
and our dream from now on.</font>

267
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

268
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,290
<font color="yellow">It's today, right?</font>

269
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should head back in.</font>

270
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,160
<font color="yellow">I should take a look to see
how it's playing out.</font>

271
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,430
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

272
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
<font color="yellow">It says National Tax Administration
on the boxes.</font>

273
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,610
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it would get this big.</font>

274
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,680
<font color="yellow">It's suffering a big loss
to gain a small profit.</font>

275
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,410
<font color="yellow">If you consider what we
could lose later, this is nothing.</font>

276
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,430
<font color="yellow">Board Director Hong is done now.</font>

277
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,200
<font color="yellow">Are both of your parents alive?</font>

278
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,200
<font color="yellow">You're still young.
I'm sure they are alive.</font>

279
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,980
<font color="yellow">Why did I even ask that?</font>

280
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,070
<font color="yellow">My mother passed away.</font>

281
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,250
<font color="yellow">It must be because I'm getting closer
to the age where people die.</font>

282
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,320
<font color="yellow">When did you first become
close to Ji Hong?</font>

283
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,150
<font color="yellow">Spicy fish stew is the best
when you catch the fish yourself.</font>

284
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,020
<font color="yellow">Enough with the questions.
You're making her nervous.</font>

285
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,460
<font color="yellow">Were you nervous?</font>

286
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,660
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

287
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,880
<font color="yellow">- I'll do it.
- No, it's okay.</font>

288
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's okay.</font>

289
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,740
<font color="yellow">It's fine for you to just sit here.</font>

290
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,450
<font color="yellow">Do you know how to cook?</font>

291
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,650
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not very good.</font>

292
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,290
<font color="yellow">That's good too.</font>

293
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,250
<font color="yellow">It's fine for you to just sit here.</font>

294
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,820
<font color="yellow">Dad, you're being very cheesy.</font>

295
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,830
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's eat now.</font>

296
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,270

301
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,210

340
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,200

- Because I liked you.</font>

but I didn't know.</font>

397
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,260
<font color="yellow">You assume I'm talking to you
but won't believe anything you say?</font>

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,980

I'll believe everything you say.</font>

improving relations with me?</font>

444
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,850
<font color="yellow">You only care about Doctor Jung Yoon Do.</font>

445
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,710
<font color="yellow">He'll be here.
Here comes the tiger...</font>

446
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,340
<font color="yellow">Is Kim Jin Han's surgery prep going well?</font>

447
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,420
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

448
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:11,460
<font color="yellow">- What about lunch in the cafeteria?
- Later, I have something to do.</font>

449
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,350
<font color="yellow">You like her that much?</font>

450
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

451
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,670
<font color="yellow">You want to hear it here or outside?</font>

452
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,290
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be seeing out-patients?</font>

453
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,240
<font color="yellow">Are you worrying about me?</font>

454
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,700
<font color="yellow">I'm not worrying--</font>

455
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,540
<font color="yellow">Let go.</font>

456
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,030
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like I'm a
crazy person who liked you by myself?</font>

457
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,790
<font color="yellow">You knew exactly how I felt.</font>

458
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,850
<font color="yellow">You knew how I felt and told me to go,
but your eyes told me to stay.</font>

459
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,150
<font color="yellow">Was I imagining that?</font>

460
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,110
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I was attracted to you for a
moment but it was a brief moment.</font>

461
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,020
<font color="yellow">The unfair thing about this is...
you didn't always only have eyes for me.</font>

462
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,790
<font color="yellow">I can endure it if you insult me
because I love you.</font>

463
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,810
<font color="yellow">But I can't stand by and
watch you insult my family.</font>

464
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,570
<font color="yellow">Fine, you felt insulted by me
all that time.</font>

465
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,220
<font color="yellow">Let's call it even since you slapped me.</font>

466
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,880
<font color="yellow">I had felt sorry towards you,
but now that burden is gone.</font>

467
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,360
<font color="yellow">My love wasn't so light that
we can call it even with this.</font>

468
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,390
<font color="yellow">Then what do you want?</font>

469
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:31,450
<font color="yellow">You're always attracted to damaged women
who have a strong nature.</font>

470
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,880
<font color="yellow">You say you love Hye Jung?</font>

471
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,140
<font color="yellow">That's not love.
That's your emotional complex.</font>

472
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,140
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get rid of your complex.</font>

473
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,410
<font color="yellow">- You're doing psych analysis now?
- I'm going to live crookedly now.</font>

474
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,310
<font color="yellow">People who really want to live crookedly
don't announce it to the world.</font>

475
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,720
<font color="yellow">This world is all wrong.</font>

476
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,400
<font color="yellow">In order to live in this world,
I have to live crookedly.</font>

477
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,080
<font color="yellow">How can a person like Hye Jung be loved
and live proudly in this world?</font>

478
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,680
<font color="yellow">You're the one who needs to get rid of
your complex about her.</font>

479
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,270
<font color="yellow">Even you see her appeal.</font>

480
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,730
<font color="yellow">You're busy making excuses
and being afraid to do anything.</font>

481
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,010
<font color="yellow">But she does it all.</font>

482
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,150
<font color="yellow">And she's pretty.</font>

483
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,520
<font color="yellow">She's pretty?</font>

484
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,470
<font color="yellow">You must be really blinded by her.</font>

485
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,130
<font color="yellow">She's pretty. Prettier than you.</font>

486
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,640
<font color="yellow">It drives you insane to hear me
talk this way, doesn't it?</font>

487
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,000
<font color="yellow">I know you very well.</font>

488
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,140
<font color="yellow">I know how to hurt you too.</font>

489
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,990
<font color="yellow">Don't try your awkward psych analysis
on me and apply it to your own life.</font>

490
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,920
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested in you as a woman,
but I do see you as a sibling.</font>

491
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,310
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

492
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,740
<font color="yellow">I'll accept your anger
until you've cooled down.</font>

493
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,930
<font color="yellow">Just like you said, I'm partly
to blame for mistaken feelings.</font>

494
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,740
<font color="yellow">But don't slap me next time.</font>

495
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,180
<font color="yellow">It feels like crap.</font>

496
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,120
<font color="yellow">She's here. She's here.</font>

497
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,050
<font color="yellow">- Do it.
- Okay, okay.</font>

498
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,400
<font color="yellow">- Doctor.
- What is it?</font>

499
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,060
<font color="yellow">About the car...
you know, the one from Boss.</font>

500
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,890
<font color="yellow">Yeah, I don't know what to do with it.
I don't know how to return it.</font>

501
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,730
<font color="yellow">Should I donate it to the hospital?</font>

502
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,520
<font color="yellow">What would the hospital do
with a sports car?</font>

503
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,540
<font color="yellow">You should just drive it.</font>

504
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,470
<font color="yellow">I believe there are no free things
in life, so I don't want it.</font>

505
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,560
<font color="yellow">I believe there are many
free things in life.</font>

506
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,380
<font color="yellow">I won't ask you for the car.
Can we ride in it just once?</font>

507
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,130
<font color="yellow">Doctor, me too.</font>

508
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,020
<font color="yellow">I have never been in
a foreign car before.</font>

509
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,010
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's right
to be born female</font>

510
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,000
<font color="yellow">and never get to ride a car like that.</font>

511
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,270
<font color="yellow">Since you said "never"...</font>

512
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,060
<font color="yellow">I said it's okay.</font>

513
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,270
<font color="yellow">It's not okay with me.</font>

514
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,690
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that I drank it.</font>

515
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,140
<font color="yellow">I'm not the only one who
doesn't like free things.</font>

516
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,910
<font color="yellow">I'm going to buy you that
fresh kiwi juice you like so much.</font>

517
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,590
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

518
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,590
<font color="yellow">Section Chief Kim Chi Hyun is here
from South Yangju.</font>

519
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,740
<font color="yellow">I said we could talk on the phone.
Why did you insist on meeting?</font>

520
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,110
<font color="yellow">It's this.</font>

521
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,610
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

522
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:34,970
<font color="yellow">It's a surgery you led when
you were in South Yangju.</font>

523
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,890
<font color="yellow">The patient's guardian came to see me.</font>

524
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,570
<font color="yellow">She was a young woman.</font>

525
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,440
<font color="yellow">It's been over 10 years.
What does she want to do?</font>

526
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,490
<font color="yellow">She wants to know everything that
happened in the operating room.</font>

527
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,430
<font color="yellow">She says she wants us to
pay for what we did.</font>

528
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,550
<font color="yellow">It's too late, legally.</font>

529
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,610
<font color="yellow">Does she know me?</font>

530
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,880
<font color="yellow">You're famous, so all she'd have to do
is search on the internet.</font>

531
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,480
<font color="yellow">She knows me, but went to you first.</font>

532
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,860
<font color="yellow">It's a scheme for money.</font>

533
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,530
<font color="yellow">It didn't seem that way.</font>

534
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,940
<font color="yellow">What else could it be?</font>

535
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,500
<font color="yellow">How can you still be so naive
about the world?</font>

536
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

537
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,520
<font color="yellow">Show me this time that you
really are one of my people.</font>

538
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,490
<font color="yellow">Then when will you bring me
up to Seoul headquarters?</font>

539
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,250
<font color="yellow"><i>You killed my grandmother, right?</i></font>

540
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,850
<font color="yellow"><i>Did you kill her?</i></font>

541
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,100
<font color="yellow"><i>You said you'd remove the cancer.</i></font>

542
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,740
<font color="yellow">What is going on with our security?</font>

543
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,430
<font color="yellow">A patient file that could not
be accessed was leaked.</font>

544
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,540
<font color="yellow">Find out who accessed it.</font>

545
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

546
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,760
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to the board meeting?</font>

547
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,550
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

548
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,130
<font color="yellow">Doo Shik will announce his retirement.</font>

549
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,000
<font color="yellow">He won't stay because of his honor.</font>

550
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,260
<font color="yellow">Some of you here...</font>

551
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,410
<font color="yellow">Some of you here today</font>

552
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:14,790
<font color="yellow">may believe that our hospital's troubles
have been brought on by me.</font>

553
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:20,550
<font color="yellow">Personally, I have learned a lot
from this incident.</font>

554
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,370
<font color="yellow">If I were to think about my own dignity,
I'd give up being director of the board.</font>

555
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,550
<font color="yellow">I want to show people that I am innocent.</font>

556
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,970
<font color="yellow">I realized that stepping down
is not the answer.</font>

557
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,410
<font color="yellow">I promise to take responsibility for
what has happened...</font>

558
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,030
<font color="yellow">and finish things up.</font>

559
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:10,710
<font color="yellow">You've changed.
You're not like you were before.</font>

560
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,800
<font color="yellow">This is why people should leave politics
when they get old.</font>

561
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,630
<font color="yellow">What is it that you want to say?</font>

562
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,540
<font color="yellow">I feel bad seeing you
turn into a greedy, old man.</font>

563
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,880
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm staying on
because of greed?</font>

564
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,950
<font color="yellow">Is it not that?</font>

565
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,770
<font color="yellow">Then, was it Ji Hong who
coached you into doing this?</font>

566
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:32,170
<font color="yellow">Since when did you have to concern
yourself with what he thinks?</font>

567
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,360
<font color="yellow">He's not even your son.
He's not your blood.</font>

568
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,040
<font color="yellow">Why, you!</font>

569
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,540
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare talk about
Ji Hong in that way.</font>

570
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,660
<font color="yellow">I won't let you get away with this.</font>

571
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,350
<font color="yellow">It's because of you that
our taxes are being investigated.</font>

572
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,010
<font color="yellow">How will you take responsibility?</font>

573
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,700
<font color="yellow">If you had something to say,
you should've said it then.</font>

574
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,010
<font color="yellow">You said nothing then,
so why say something now?</font>

575
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,260
<font color="yellow">I assumed you would retire.
Who knew you'd insist on staying on?</font>

576
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,920
<font color="yellow">Someone planned this whole thing
and leaked it.</font>

577
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,210
<font color="yellow">I'm looking into it.</font>

578
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,910
<font color="yellow">If it was someone in the hospital,
I need to find out why.</font>

579
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,540
<font color="yellow">My judgment is not dead yet.</font>

580
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,160
<font color="yellow">So don't get in my way.</font>

581
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,740
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about he said.</font>

582
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,100
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Before...</font>

583
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,850
<font color="yellow">He said you're not my son or whatever.</font>

584
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,260
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

585
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,620
<font color="yellow">I stopped caring about
that stuff long ago.</font>

586
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,290
<font color="yellow">You're like a boy going through puberty
getting in fights over that.</font>

587
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,010
<font color="yellow">Are you making fun of me too?</font>

588
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,000
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

589
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,170
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.</font>

590
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,310
<font color="yellow">Tripping is not a big deal.
You don't need to worry.</font>

591
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,800
<font color="yellow">How long has it been since
your last physical exam?</font>

592
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,830
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

593
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:44,210
<font color="yellow">You've been going for check-ups
and following up, right?</font>

594
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,690
<font color="yellow">I'm all better now.
Why would I bother?</font>

595
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:48,300
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

596
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,880
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose my hearing.</font>

597
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,840
<font color="yellow">Get some tests done while you're here.</font>

598
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,140
<font color="yellow">Later, it's such a pain to do it.</font>

599
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,790
<font color="yellow">That's why you should do it.</font>

600
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,540
<font color="yellow">If I do that now</font>

601
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,010
<font color="yellow">there will be rumors that I'm dying
even though there is nothing wrong.</font>

602
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,560
<font color="yellow">In a situation like this,
I can't do it based on just your feeling.</font>

603
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,050
<font color="yellow">You misspoke twice during
the board meeting.</font>

604
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,560
<font color="yellow">Your face muscles twisted too.</font>

605
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,060
<font color="yellow">I think it's facial numbness.</font>

606
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,870
<font color="yellow">No, no. It's not.</font>

607
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,600
<font color="yellow">I just pronounced it wrong.</font>

608
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,290
<font color="yellow">Your facial muscles changed.</font>

609
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,360
<font color="yellow">You're just too sensitive.</font>

610
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,690
<font color="yellow">Your body tilted a bit.
I think it's ataxia.</font>

611
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,400
<font color="yellow">It could be the
Vestibular Schwannoma again.</font>

612
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,970
<font color="yellow">Get a medical exam, Dad.</font>

613
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,350
<font color="yellow">Looks normal.</font>

614
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,580
<font color="yellow">Why would you let him hit you?</font>

615
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:48,160
<font color="yellow">What happened with Director Hong?</font>

616
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,020
<font color="yellow">Does he know you did it?</font>

617
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,180
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't stay put if he knew.</font>

618
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:57,140
<font color="yellow">What if he finds out about the slush fund
in the hospital foundation?</font>

619
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,860
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.
That will never happen, Dad.</font>

620
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,950
<font color="yellow">What were you doing
letting it get this bad?</font>

621
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,260
<font color="yellow">It's too big and it's
pressing on the brain stem.</font>

622
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,960
<font color="yellow">Surgery will be hard.</font>

623
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,710
<font color="yellow">It's all my fault.</font>

624
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,080
<font color="yellow">No, it's my fault.</font>

625
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:29,970
<font color="yellow">I call him my mentor and teacher,
but I didn't even follow up.</font>

626
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,010
<font color="yellow">What do we do now?</font>

627
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,770
<font color="yellow">What else can we do?
You need to do surgery.</font>

628
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:38,930
<font color="yellow">How can I do this surgery on him?</font>

629
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:40,930
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong,
I won't be able to live.</font>

630
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,010
<font color="yellow">Then, who will do it?</font>

631
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,520
<font color="yellow">I can't do it.</font>

632
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,910
<font color="yellow">Doctor Jung Yoon Do
will be better than me.</font>

633
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,010
<font color="yellow">He has better hands than me and his
surgeries are the most successful lately.</font>

634
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,660
<font color="yellow">No one can find out.</font>

635
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,470
<font color="yellow">Even if the surgery is a success,
he needs to rest for several months.</font>

636
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,030
<font color="yellow">Tell him to retire from his position as
director of the board.</font>

637
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,250
<font color="yellow">Nothing is more important than life.</font>

638
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,230
<font color="yellow">Please make sure no one finds out until
my dad makes his decision.</font>

639
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,390
<font color="yellow">You're just an orphan.
You ought to know your place.</font>

640
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,800
<font color="yellow">Why are you so good at studying?</font>

641
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,830
<font color="yellow">You need to get beaten up.</font>

642
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:31,200
<font color="yellow">Why do we need be stressed out
because of you?</font>

643
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,790
<font color="yellow">You may be good at studying.</font>

644
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,150
<font color="yellow">But you will always be at
the bottom your whole life.</font>

645
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,230
<font color="yellow">It's you guys who will be
at the bottom all your lives.</font>

646
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,300
<font color="yellow">You think I'm getting beaten up
because I'm not strong?</font>

647
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:52,930
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you hit me
because I'm an orphan.</font>

648
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:54,570
<font color="yellow">Stop showing off.</font>

649
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,500
<font color="yellow">That's enough... for today.</font>

650
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,970
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I'm not someone
for you to compete with.</font>

651
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,840
<font color="yellow">You punk, are you crazy?</font>

652
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,710
<font color="yellow">What are you kids doing there?</font>

653
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,180
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.</font>

654
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,400
<font color="yellow">Today's not the only day.
We always have tomorrow.</font>

655
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,780
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

656
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,880
<font color="yellow">I'm okay, Director.</font>

657
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,850
<font color="yellow">You don't seem okay to me.</font>

658
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,640
<font color="yellow">It will take two weeks to fully heal.</font>

659
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,120
<font color="yellow">I'm okay because it will
be better in two weeks.</font>

660
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,210
<font color="yellow">Aren't you overthinking things
too much for a man?</font>

661
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:38,840
<font color="yellow">You must enjoy losing.</font>

662
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,210
<font color="yellow">- Reality is not a movie.
- What?</font>

663
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,530
<font color="yellow">Hitting people without thinking
about the consequences.</font>

664
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:47,120
<font color="yellow">Getting overly emotional and
putting people in danger.</font>

665
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,760
<font color="yellow">Do you like these types of things?</font>

666
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,500
<font color="yellow">That's how junior high kids act.</font>

667
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,660
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come with me?</font>

668
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,980
<font color="yellow">No... do you want to live with me?</font>

669
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,120
<font color="yellow">I'm saying no.</font>

670
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,360
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry a woman.</font>

671
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,540
<font color="yellow">Did I ask to marry you?</font>

672
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,450
<font color="yellow">How would you like to be my son?</font>

673
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,820
<font color="yellow"><i>I will accept your congrats and
congratulate you too.</i></font>

674
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:19,020
<font color="yellow">Your dream of having the same job
as your son came true.</font>

675
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,670
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask to see me here?</font>

676
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,750
<font color="yellow">Are those mine?</font>

677
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,200
<font color="yellow">It grew a lot in that time.</font>

678
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh, life is a scary thing.</font>

679
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,280
<font color="yellow">Even cancer cells are working away
so hard to try and live.</font>

680
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,510
<font color="yellow">It is definitely the
Vestibular Schwannoma.</font>

681
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,190
<font color="yellow">It really is strong.</font>

682
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,150
<font color="yellow">You need to admit yourself.</font>

683
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,530
<font color="yellow">I won't get surgery.</font>

684
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,260
<font color="yellow">Nothing is more important
than your health.</font>

685
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,480
<font color="yellow">It's already progressed this far.
We can't delay the surgery.</font>

686
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:30,460
<font color="yellow">I can't do it now.</font>

687
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,050
<font color="yellow">How can I with the way things are?</font>

688
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,020
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

689
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,280
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

690
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,680
<font color="yellow">I no longer want to send off
the people I love before me.</font>

691
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,430
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

692
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,760
<font color="yellow">Oh, this car is so beautiful.</font>

693
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,060
<font color="yellow">Doctor, let's go to Gangbyeon.</font>

694
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,890
<font color="yellow">We can go to this hotel there.</font>

695
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:06,180
<font color="yellow">Hotel? Are you crazy?</font>

696
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:09,760
<font color="yellow">We can't do that.
We're not in that kind of relationship.›</font>

697
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,210
<font color="yellow">Did I say I wanted to sleep with you?
I wanted to eat pizza.</font>

698
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,920
<font color="yellow">There's a good pizza place
on the hill by that hotel.</font>

699
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:20,430
<font color="yellow">Today, I'm pretending to be
from a wealthy family.</font>

700
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,290
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You have to open the door for me.</font>

701
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,760
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

702
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,890
<font color="yellow">Wow! This is so nice.</font>

703
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,430
<font color="yellow">- What are you looking for?
- This.</font>

704
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,810
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just drive?</font>

705
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,070
<font color="yellow">If you act awkward like this,
you'll ruin my whole rich girl act.</font>

706
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:47,550
<font color="yellow">Right now, I'm on a date with a guy who
has 20 foreign cars like this.</font>

707
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,190
<font color="yellow">What's with her Cinderella fantasy?</font>

708
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,500
<font color="yellow">Why did Cinderella have to
lose her glass slipper?</font>

709
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:56,160
<font color="yellow">She made all the girls in the world
look for a prince.</font>

710
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,560
<font color="yellow">Hurry. Let's go.</font>

711
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,620
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my! Wow, it's amazing!</font>

712
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,740
<font color="yellow">So amazing!</font>

713
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,980
<font color="yellow">- Should we get going?
- Yes!</font>

714
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,020
<font color="yellow">I'll drive around the parking lot once.</font>

715
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,220
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

716
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,300
<font color="yellow">There's no insurance on this car,
so we can't get into an accident.</font>

717
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,230
<font color="yellow">Why are you worrying suddenly?</font>

718
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,320
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

719
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,200
<font color="yellow">You're a great driver. What accident?</font>

720
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,500
<font color="yellow">I am a good driver,
but I don't have a license.</font>

721
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,560
<font color="yellow">What? What kind of guy doesn't have
a driver's license?</font>

722
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,900
<font color="yellow">I've been so busy
that I couldn't get one.</font>

723
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,040
<font color="yellow">I'll get it next year.</font>

724
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,530
<font color="yellow">If you want to drive,
you can do it, Nurse Hyun.</font>

725
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,990
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

726
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:46,330
<font color="yellow">What was I thinking
pretending to be a rich girl?</font>

727
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,760
<font color="yellow">Stop! I'll drive the car.</font>

728
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,810
<font color="yellow">Okay, but why are you getting mad?</font>

729
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,170
<font color="yellow">I'm in big trouble now.</font>

730
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,140
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do now?</font>

731
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:30,080
<font color="yellow">Hey, just focus on eating when we eat.</font>

732
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,790
<font color="yellow">Oh, isn't that Doctor Yoo?</font>

733
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,300
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Why are you drawing that?</font>

734
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,370
<font color="yellow">Are you still dreaming of
being a comic book artist?</font>

735
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:42,140
<font color="yellow">Joong Dae, you don't throw away dreams.
You should develop them.</font>

736
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,120
<font color="yellow">This might be my last work
before I'm beaten to death.</font>

737
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,600
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to eat?</font>

738
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,510
<font color="yellow">Hello, what brings you by?</font>

739
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,800
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some noodles?
- No, it's okay.</font>

740
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,530
<font color="yellow">I can't live after doing wrong.</font>

741
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,080
<font color="yellow">What are you doing there?</font>

742
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,900
<font color="yellow">- Doctor.
- Are you hiding from me?</font>

743
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,470
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Give me the car keys.</font>

744
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,260
<font color="yellow">You look like you're about to cry.</font>

745
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,850
<font color="yellow">I guess the car is very good because
I rammed into the other car very hard.</font>

746
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,820
<font color="yellow">The damage wasn't too bad though.</font>

747
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,740
<font color="yellow">How can you leave it like this?</font>

748
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,250
<font color="yellow">I was going to take it to get fixed.</font>

749
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,970
<font color="yellow">I was on duty the whole time,
so I didn't have time.</font>

750
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,530
<font color="yellow">Get it fixed quickly.</font>

751
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,300
<font color="yellow">- Is that it?
- Yes.</font>

752
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,600
<font color="yellow">- It's not enough? Should I hit you?
- No.</font>

753
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,750
<font color="yellow">It'll cost a lot to fix.</font>

754
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:37,740
<font color="yellow">If you don't plan on driving it,
do I really need to fix it?</font>

755
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,020
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

756
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:43,870
<font color="yellow">Gosh...</font>

757
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,920
<font color="yellow">Doctor, should I keep waiting here?</font>

758
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,620
<font color="yellow">I have surgery soon.</font>

759
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,680
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

760
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,250
<font color="yellow">Both of you, come over here.</font>

761
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:17,210
<font color="yellow">I want Doctor Jung Yoon Do
to do surgery on this patient.</font>

762
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,870
<font color="yellow">I want Doctor Yoo Hye Jung to assist.</font>

763
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,050
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

764
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,620
<font color="yellow">It's Director Hong Doo Shik.</font>

765
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,070
<font color="yellow">I don't want to do it.</font>

766
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,340
<font color="yellow">The entire hospital will be
paying very close attention.</font>

767
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,970
<font color="yellow">I don't want the attention.</font>

768
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:34,370
<font color="yellow">I don't want anyone but the three of us
to know about the surgery.</font>

769
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,030
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me why.</font>

770
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,420
<font color="yellow">It's large in size and pressing on the
brain stem, so it won't be easy.</font>

771
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,650
<font color="yellow">Also, you say it's a relapse?</font>

772
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:46,320
<font color="yellow">Rather than total removal,
I'd like you to use lateral SOC.</font>

773
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,890
<font color="yellow">Then I want you to use
radiosurgery for the rest.</font>

774
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:50,670
<font color="yellow">I think total removal is better.</font>

775
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,390
<font color="yellow">It relapsed after he tried radiosurgery.</font>

776
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:53,390
<font color="yellow">Total removal?</font>

777
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,250
<font color="yellow">His facial paralysis is not bad,
so we save those nerves.</font>

778
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,480
<font color="yellow">The trans-lab approach is best to
remove the cancer completely.</font>

779
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,990
<font color="yellow">That surgery takes a long time.</font>

780
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,370
<font color="yellow">No, take the safe route.</font>

781
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:09,170
<font color="yellow">If you do not want total removal</font>

782
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,160
<font color="yellow">there's no need for me
to do this surgery.</font>

783
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,720
<font color="yellow">You know me. I'm all or nothing.</font>

784
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,140
<font color="yellow">All or nothing.</font>

785
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,660
<font color="yellow">Don't be overconfident.
Be humble with this surgery.</font>

786
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,320
<font color="yellow">If you don't trust me,
you can ask someone else.</font>

787
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,840
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I don't trust you.
I'm asking you to be careful.</font>

788
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,680
<font color="yellow">You're not being your normal self.</font>

789
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,100
<font color="yellow">All surgeries have risk.</font>

790
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,560
<font color="yellow">"Be careful" are words that mean fear.</font>

791
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,330
<font color="yellow">It's over for a surgeon
if they feel fear.</font>

792
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,300
<font color="yellow">Are you scaring me before
the surgery has even started?</font>

793
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,740
<font color="yellow">Is it true you're going for
a total removal?</font>

794
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,460
<font color="yellow">Don't remove it dangerously. Be safe.</font>

795
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:09,280
<font color="yellow">There's that word "safe" again.</font>

796
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:13,210
<font color="yellow">My principle is sub total clear.
Don't worry.</font>

797
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,980
<font color="yellow">I'm making this request.</font>

798
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,860
<font color="yellow">You're acting like the general public.</font>

799
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,010
<font color="yellow">This pressure and request.</font>

800
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:23,960
<font color="yellow">And you, Doctor Jung,
are speaking in a very improper tone.</font>

801
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,410
<font color="yellow">Do you speak this way to
family members of other patients?</font>

802
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,370
<font color="yellow">They don't treat doctors this way.</font>

803
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:32,800
<font color="yellow">They trust the doctors.</font>

804
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,930
<font color="yellow">Do you trust me?</font>

805
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:42,910
<font color="yellow">I did not want this patient.</font>

806
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:46,020
<font color="yellow">I can quit now if you want me to.</font>

807
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,750
<font color="yellow">Well, I have another surgery to do.</font>

808
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,180
<font color="yellow">Irrigation.</font>

809
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,490
<font color="yellow">Doctor Hong is acting that way
because he's scared.</font>

810
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,490
<font color="yellow">He's worried something could go wrong.</font>

811
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,920
<font color="yellow">You're the same too.</font>

812
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:33,500
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

813
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,560
<font color="yellow">You're scared something could go wrong
and you'll get all the blame.</font>

814
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,410
<font color="yellow">That's why you're acting tough.</font>

815
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,170
<font color="yellow">Who says I'm scared?</font>

816
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,720
<font color="yellow">Don't be scared. I'll be assisting you.</font>

817
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,990
<font color="yellow">I'll be helping so you don't
have to be scared.</font>

818
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,600
<font color="yellow">- You have an ego.
- Yes.</font>

819
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:59,220
<font color="yellow">When you grow up in a poor environment,
it helps to have a healthy ego.</font>

820
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,910
<font color="yellow">Should we cut this?</font>

821
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think we should cut it.</font>

822
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

823
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:39,010
<font color="yellow">I searched your work history
before you came here.</font>

824
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:42,340
<font color="yellow">Am I livestock for you to judge
or something?</font>

825
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,800
<font color="yellow">You are very talented.</font>

826
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,580
<font color="yellow">You asked me if I trust you?</font>

827
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,970
<font color="yellow">I trust you as a doctor.</font>

828
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,750
<font color="yellow">Should I bow down in thanks?</font>

829
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,610
<font color="yellow">As a patient's guardian,
I don't trust you.</font>

830
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,320
<font color="yellow">If this surgery goes wrong...</font>
