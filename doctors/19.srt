<font color="yellow">I don't think it was a bit.</font>

152
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,339
<font color="yellow">There seems to be an inflammation in your liver.</font>

153
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,839
<font color="yellow">I'll do an ultrasonic wave test on your liver.</font>

154
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:20,939
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

155
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,309
<font color="yellow">How do you know Dr Jung?</font>

156
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:26,669
<font color="yellow">He's a regular at my diner.</font>

157
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,709
<font color="yellow">He also did my wife's surgery.</font>

158
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:33,109
<font color="yellow">Dr Jung must be going the extra mile because you're Dr Yoo's father.</font>

159
00:10:33,469 --> 00:10:34,469
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful.</font>

160
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,509
<font color="yellow">The prosecution just needs the slush fund transactions, right?</font>

161
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,269
<font color="yellow">This will end faster than I thought.</font>

162
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,809
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

163
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,409
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't use it now.</font>

164
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:48,869
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

165
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:52,769
<font color="yellow">President Jin is holding Dr Yoo as collateral.</font>

166
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:53,969
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo?</font>

167
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:01,769
<font color="yellow">I don't believe it. You turned out to be a total romantic.</font>

168
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,009
<font color="yellow">Dr Kim.</font>

169
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:07,109
<font color="yellow">When I heard that you're going to the research centre,</font>

170
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,569
<font color="yellow">I knew there must be some big reason.</font>

171
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,669
<font color="yellow">But who knew it would be for love? Should I congratulate you?</font>

172
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,339
<font color="yellow">Stop making fun of me.</font>

173
00:11:15,969 --> 00:11:18,969
<font color="yellow">I like seeing you dating someone and I hope it works out.</font>

174
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,539
<font color="yellow">But Ji Hong, we don't have much time.</font>

175
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,339
<font color="yellow">Once the geriatrics centre takes its initial steps,</font>

176
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,639
<font color="yellow">the hospital would face too much loss.</font>

177
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:32,769
<font color="yellow">Whoever takes President Jin's place...</font>

178
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:37,069
<font color="yellow">will have to start with a burden of a great deficit on his shoulders.</font>

179
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,169
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm thinking about it.</font>

180
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,339
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

181
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:51,009
<font color="yellow">Can I talk to you for a minute?</font>

182
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:07,309
<font color="yellow">Did you come to work here...</font>

183
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,139
<font color="yellow">because of my dad?</font>

184
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:12,169
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

185
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:15,239
<font color="yellow">Do you think your grandma died from my dad's medical malpractice?</font>

186
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,869
<font color="yellow">It's a fact, not an opinion. I confirmed it.</font>

187
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,639
<font color="yellow">How could you confirm something that happened 13 years ago?</font>

188
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,969
<font color="yellow">There can't be any records left.</font>

189
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,439
<font color="yellow">There were records.</font>

190
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,109
<font color="yellow">Someone still had them.</font>

191
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,009
<font color="yellow">Why would anyone keep it if it's not even his own?</font>

192
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:33,269
<font color="yellow">There was a good enough reason and I accepted it.</font>

193
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:38,469
<font color="yellow">Did you read out the records accurately? Who helped you with it?</font>

194
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,009
<font color="yellow">Dr Jung Pa Ran.</font>

195
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:46,069
<font color="yellow">Things we can't control happen in the operation room.</font>

196
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,539
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

197
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,639
<font color="yellow">They made a settlement.</font>

198
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,809
<font color="yellow">My dad and the hospital.</font>

199
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,769
<font color="yellow">I came to ask you something.</font>

200
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,269
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- Did Dr Yoo come see you...</font>

201
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:14,339
<font color="yellow">to ask for help in reading out an anaesthesiology report?</font>

202
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,469
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did and I told her the surgeon made a mistake.</font>

203
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,809
<font color="yellow">Does Prof. Hong Ji Hong know about this as well?</font>

204
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,009
<font color="yellow">He probably does.</font>

205
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,569
<font color="yellow">He was the one who introduced me to Dr Yoo.</font>

206
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,009
<font color="yellow">Then does Yoon Do know about it too?</font>

207
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,009
<font color="yellow">Yes, he does. He likes Dr Yoo.</font>

208
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,769
<font color="yellow">I've never seen anyone have such a creative crush.</font>

209
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:40,069
<font color="yellow">Thank you for telling me.</font>

210
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,239
<font color="yellow">Did you become a director...</font>

211
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,269
<font color="yellow">because of Hye Jung?</font>

212
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,009
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- To help her?</font>

213
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:05,009
<font color="yellow">Not just her, but also Prof. Hong.</font>

214
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,139
<font color="yellow">You never cease to surprise me.</font>

215
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,339
<font color="yellow">You weren't like this before.</font>

216
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:14,039
<font color="yellow">You never interfere in other people's affairs.</font>

217
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,009
<font color="yellow">You don't like fights or politics.</font>

218
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,909
<font color="yellow">There was no other way for me to get closer to Dr Yoo.</font>

219
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,539
<font color="yellow">Is that all that matters?</font>

220
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:23,739
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

221
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,569
<font color="yellow">You've known me for a long time.</font>

222
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:27,169
<font color="yellow">We're close friends.</font>

223
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,409
<font color="yellow">You've relied on me during hardships.</font>

224
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:31,909
<font color="yellow">How could you do this to me?</font>

225
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:37,169
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- Then act like you are.</font>

227

<font color="yellow">Don't make this hard for my dad.</font>

228
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:44,069

00:19:01,439 --> 00:19:02,509
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

301
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,069
<font color="yellow">I'd like to consult you on something.</font>

302
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:05,339
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

303
00:19:06,109 --> 00:19:07,709
<font color="yellow">My father was here.</font>

304
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,869
<font color="yellow">- To see you?
- No, as a patient.</font>

305
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,009
<font color="yellow">I was so worried, thinking that it might be something serious.</font>

306
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,009
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard to turn away from him if he's ill.</font>

307
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:24,909
<font color="yellow">Right. Family relationships are usually the most difficult ones.</font>

308
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:30,069
<font color="yellow">You get hurt the most by them yet feel the most attached to them.</font>

309
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,809
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to be close to him.
- No one is asking you to do so.</font>

310
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,869
<font color="yellow">You're putting that pressure on yourself.</font>

311
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:39,969
<font color="yellow">- You won't tell me to do so?
- I won't.</font>

312
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:43,139
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you to do something that I don't do myself.</font>

313
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:45,909
<font color="yellow">That makes me feel better.</font>

314
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:50,339
<font color="yellow">- How can you be so cool?
- Why are you sweet suddenly?</font>

315
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:53,939
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy that you're my man.</font>

316
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,639
<font color="yellow">- Am I your man?
- Yes. You're mine.</font>

317
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:04,909
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

318
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:07,469
<font color="yellow">It looks like those beagles have stopped coming over to your place.</font>

319
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,209
<font color="yellow">Yes. See you around.</font>

321
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:37,539
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, you startled me.
- Did I surprise you?</font>

322
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:41,009
<font color="yellow">It looked like you were out on a date. Why are you here?</font>

323
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:42,869
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to have dinner with me later?</font>

324
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,109
<font color="yellow">No. I don't like how you're looking at me.</font>

325
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:47,669
<font color="yellow">- It looks like you pity me.
- That's not what it is.</font>

326
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:50,279
<font color="yellow">Come over to my place later. I'll have food ready.</font>

327
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,839
<font color="yellow">- No, thanks.
- Bring a bottle of wine.</font>

328
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:55,469
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

329
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,709
<font color="yellow">Why are you ignoring my opinion altogether...</font>

330
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,239
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

331
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,669
<font color="yellow">- Where did he go?
- He should be back soon.</font>

332
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:11,009
<font color="yellow">He just stepped out because Chairman Jin came by.</font>

333
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,279
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

334
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,539
<font color="yellow">I am going to...</font>

335
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:52,809
<font color="yellow">kill you.</font>

336
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,469
<font color="yellow">I'll torture you to death even if I can't actually kill you.</font>

337
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,439
<font color="yellow">Did you say Seo Woo is here to see me?</font>

338
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:06,609
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're here.</font>

339
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,769
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

340
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,309
<font color="yellow">- Hye Jung told me.
- I don't want to hear that name.</font>

341
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:21,269
<font color="yellow">It was just an accident. It's not like I intended it.</font>

342
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:24,139
<font color="yellow">She should know better as a doctor, but she's stressing me out.</font>

343
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,939
<font color="yellow">What did she do to you?</font>

344
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:29,939
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about it. My head hurts because of it.</font>

345
00:22:30,669 --> 00:22:31,739
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling sick?</font>

346
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:34,309
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of stress because there's too much on my plate.</font>

347
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,869
<font color="yellow">- You're leaving already?
- I want to look into something.</font>

348
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,239
<font color="yellow">I kept researching after I spoke to you the last time.</font>

349
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:54,669
<font color="yellow">I was looking for a way to make you...</font>

350
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,809
<font color="yellow">take responsibility legally for what happened to my grandmother.</font>

351
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,339
<font color="yellow">- Did you find any?
- There was none.</font>

352
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:03,309
<font color="yellow">So I found another way.</font>

353
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,169
<font color="yellow">I am going to...</font>

354
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:07,339
<font color="yellow">kill you.</font>

<font color="yellow">(OPERATING ROOM)</font>

356
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,809
<font color="yellow">He's my dad, so I obviously have to think from his perspective.</font>

357
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:40,469
<font color="yellow">Do it, then.</font>

358
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:42,209
<font color="yellow">I heard how you threatened him.</font>

359
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,339
<font color="yellow">You said you'd harass him and torture him to death.</font>

360
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,339
<font color="yellow">Did he tell you?</font>

361
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,769
<font color="yellow">No. I found a recording.</font>

362
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:54,909
<font color="yellow">Recording?</font>

363
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,209
<font color="yellow">A recording of the conversation you two had.</font>

364
00:23:58,509 --> 00:23:59,539
<font color="yellow">I guess he recorded it.</font>

365
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,509
<font color="yellow">It's so cruel. How can you say that when you're a doctor yourself?</font>

366
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,809
<font color="yellow">Has every single one of your surgeries been successful?</font>

367
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:07,869
<font color="yellow">I'm sure some of the patients you operated on died too.</font>

368
00:24:08,209 --> 00:24:11,009
<font color="yellow">Any doctor can make a mistake during a surgery.</font>

369
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,909
<font color="yellow">But do you know what he said to me after the surgery going wrong?</font>

370
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:19,509
<font color="yellow">"I did my best, so I'm not scared of anything."</font>

371
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,669
<font color="yellow">Then he said that he'll talk to my parents.</font>

372
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:25,339
<font color="yellow">You were underage, so he had to talk to your parents.</font>

373
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,109
<font color="yellow">He should've expressed condolences for her death first.</font>

374
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,439
<font color="yellow">Had he apologised properly...</font>

375
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,609
<font color="yellow">and showed me that he respects my grandma's life,</font>

376
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:36,739
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have come this far.</font>

377
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,339
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me any of this?</font>

378
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,669
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have misunderstood you if you had shared it with me.</font>

379
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,639
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be considerate of you.</font>

380
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:51,939
<font color="yellow">Why though?</font>

381
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:56,139
<font color="yellow">Your kindness helped me do well on the math test,</font>

382
00:24:57,509 --> 00:24:59,439
<font color="yellow">and it inspired me to study hard.</font>

383
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:03,439
<font color="yellow">You gave me so much through that experience.</font>

384
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,139
<font color="yellow">That's why I kept it from you.</font>

385
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,309
<font color="yellow">You're acting strange. I think something happened to you.</font>

386
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,709
<font color="yellow">Something happened.</font>

387
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:41,009
<font color="yellow">I became the head of the DBS research centre.</font>

388
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:44,269
<font color="yellow">- Will that change anything?
- Do you know this feeling?</font>

389
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:47,469
<font color="yellow">You hate it, but you want it badly.</font>

390
00:25:58,339 --> 00:25:59,739
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
- Hi.</font>

391
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:03,209
<font color="yellow">I made steaks. I grilled the meat how I like it, though.</font>

392
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:06,209
<font color="yellow">I'll just eat whatever you give me. Here's a bottle of wine.</font>

393
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:09,009
<font color="yellow">It's an expensive vintage wine.</font>

394
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:17,309
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

395
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:24,639
<font color="yellow">It's so awkward to be wining and dining with a guy like this.</font>

396
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,409
<font color="yellow">I haven't had a chance to thank you...</font>

397
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:34,169
<font color="yellow">for what you did after my father's death...</font>

398
00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:35,439
<font color="yellow">and the vote you gave us at the board meeting.</font>

399
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,969
<font color="yellow">Do you like me that much?</font>

400
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,939
<font color="yellow">You know I didn't do it for you.</font>

401
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,209
<font color="yellow">Do you like Hye Jung that much?</font>

402
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,039
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

403
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,569
<font color="yellow">Could you like me more?</font>

404
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,309
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- I almost threw up.</font>

405
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:57,939
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting like this?</font>

406
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,609
<font color="yellow">It's because I like you.</font>

407
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:04,239
<font color="yellow">This is an interesting way to make me give up.</font>

408
00:27:04,339 --> 00:27:05,739
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'd give up if I act like this?</font>

409
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:06,969
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's working.</font>

410
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:10,569
<font color="yellow">It seems like I stand no chance.</font>

411
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:15,339
<font color="yellow">Can't you try working things out with Seo Woo?</font>

412
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:18,709
<font color="yellow">She's just a friend to me.</font>

413
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,339
<font color="yellow">I feel like I should be taking care of her.</font>

<font color="yellow">When did you put your nose in it?</font>

416
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:28,339
<font color="yellow">I could help you...</font>

417

418
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:32,939

419
00:27:33,339 --> 00:27:34,869
<font color="yellow">- You did?
- Yes.</font>

420
00:27:35,209 --> 00:27:36,839
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you used it against him?</font>

421

566
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,769

569
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:10,569
<font color="yellow">The attorney is here.</font>

570
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:13,339
<font color="yellow">Why in the world did they arrest him?</font>

571
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:15,269
<font color="yellow">It looks like they were concerned about him destroying evidence.</font>

572
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:16,939
<font color="yellow">They already put in a request for a trial.</font>

573
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,869
<font color="yellow">Chairman Jin isn't a victim. He's the defendant of the case.</font>

- We should do it.</font>

575
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:23,609
<font color="yellow">It'll cost you a lot, though.</font>

576
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:26,039
<font color="yellow">Who cares about how much it'll cost? Get him out as soon as possible!</font>

577
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:37,009
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is, just say it. You probably want to console me.</font>

578
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,209
<font color="yellow">It's not like anything I say will make you feel better.</font>

579
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:42,609
<font color="yellow">You've never gone through anything like this, right?</font>

580
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:48,469
<font color="yellow">I have. Twice.</font>

585
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:28,869

586

592
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:45,469
<font color="yellow">I destroyed it.</font>

593
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:47,539

596
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,139
<font color="yellow">I wanted to avoid it altogether because I felt like it was my fault.</font>

597
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:58,439
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong. She's overreacting.</font>

00:40:00,509 --> 00:40:02,109
<font color="yellow">Do you think she's normal for coming here because of it?</font>

600
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,539
<font color="yellow">She's not normal.</font>

601
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:07,339
<font color="yellow">If that had happened to you, I would have killed the doctor right away.</font>

602
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,969
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that? You should've just apologised for your mistake.</font>

603
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:13,039
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to hurt her feelings?</font>

604
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,339
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many people will try to make money off of you...</font>

605
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,069
<font color="yellow">when you apologise for things like that?</font>

606
00:40:17,069 --> 00:40:18,839
<font color="yellow">How have you been living your life?</font>

607
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:22,909
<font color="yellow">Have you only seen those kinds of people? What about nice people?</font>

608
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:25,709
<font color="yellow">Do you think weird people like that make up the entire population?</font>

609
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,009
<font color="yellow">Is that how you decide to treat people?</font>

610
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,739
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed of you. You humiliate me.</font>

611
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:36,309
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed of myself too. I'm mortified.</font>

612
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,339
<font color="yellow">Don't listen to what people are saying. This mess will end soon.</font>

00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:46,809
<font color="yellow">Making sure her grandmother could live comfortably.</font>

616
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:50,709
<font color="yellow">She wanted to run her grandmother's diner after graduating.</font>

617
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:54,209
<font color="yellow">Her only dream was to continue living with her grandmother.</font>

618
00:40:56,209 --> 00:40:57,969
<font color="yellow">Why can't you empathise with people?</font>

619
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:01,869
<font color="yellow">"I did my best, but I'm so sorry that the result is this."</font>

620
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:04,569
<font color="yellow">"I'm truly sorry for your loss."</font>

626
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:36,969
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>

627
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:40,739
<font color="yellow">What brings you here, Professor? Good to see you.</font>

628
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,709
<font color="yellow">Am I not allowed to come here or what?</font>

629
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,609
<font color="yellow">You're allowed, of course. You must be here to see Dr Yoo.</font>

630
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,569
<font color="yellow">I am? Who said that?</font>

631
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,469
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, we know everything now.
- What are you talking about?</font>

632
00:41:50,969 --> 00:41:52,239
<font color="yellow">The two of you...</font>

633
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:54,809
<font color="yellow">Professor, there's something I have to tell you.</font>

634
00:41:54,969 --> 00:41:56,909
<font color="yellow">Really? Let's talk, then.</font>

635
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:02,939
<font color="yellow">Do they actually think that we don't know?</font>

636
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:06,839
<font color="yellow">No way. If that's the case, they're way too slow.</font>

637
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,839
<font color="yellow">People might find out soon.</font>

638
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:15,509
<font color="yellow">They already know. Can't you tell from the looks they give us?</font>

639
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:19,339
<font color="yellow">Well, Dr Kim knows, which means everyone must know by now.</font>

640
00:42:20,209 --> 00:42:22,939
<font color="yellow">Don't you think we should pretend not to know about it, though?</font>

641
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,909
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- To entertain people.</font>

642
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:27,739
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's do that.</font>

643
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:32,969
<font color="yellow">You seem so unworried. Are you going to stay at the research centre?</font>

644
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,269
<font color="yellow">- That's up to President Jin.
- Tell him you want to come back.</font>

645
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:38,769
<font color="yellow">Aren't you hungry? I'm quite hungry.</font>

646
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:41,339
<font color="yellow">I want to eat cold noodles before I go home. Shall we get it now?</font>

647
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:42,739
<font color="yellow">Don't do these things.</font>

648
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:46,409
<font color="yellow">- What did I do?
- Changing the topic.</font>

649
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,509
<font color="yellow">You can't make your moves because of the recording, right?</font>

650
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,239
<font color="yellow">I guess you won't give up until you go all the way to the end.</font>

651
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:53,909
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

652
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,869
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can't because of the recording.</font>

653
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:00,809
<font color="yellow">However, we'll get a new president when Chairman Jin gets dismissed.</font>

654
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,069
<font color="yellow">I'll lay low because he's probably furious at me right now.</font>

655
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:05,709
<font color="yellow">You're a coward.</font>

656
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:09,939

<font color="yellow">You're on night duty today, right?</font>

660
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:17,639
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you. Meet me briefly.</font>

661
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:21,069
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm with someone now.</font>

662
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:23,739
<font color="yellow">It's something important.</font>

663
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:44,039
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

664
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:47,669
<font color="yellow">Did your dad tell you to give this to me?</font>

665
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:50,569
<font color="yellow">No. I stole it.</font>

666
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:56,769
<font color="yellow">I've met your grandmother.</font>

667
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,339
<font color="yellow">She came to visit me with juice when I was hospitalised.</font>

668
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:04,339
<font color="yellow">It was 100 percent fruit juice.</font>

669
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:09,009
<font color="yellow">I've never thought of you as my competition.</font>

670
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:11,709
<font color="yellow">I was kind to you...</font>

671
00:44:12,409 --> 00:44:14,309
<font color="yellow">because you weren't my competition.</font>

672
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,139
<font color="yellow">The reason doesn't change the fact that you were kind to me.</font>

673
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,269
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to admit that you were better than me.</font>

674
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:26,539
<font color="yellow">I think that's where my tragedy began.</font>

675
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,269
<font color="yellow">I provoked you.</font>

676
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:34,869
<font color="yellow">I didn't know...</font>

677
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:37,709
<font color="yellow">because it was before I entered the system called competition.</font>

678
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:41,139
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

679
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:46,569
<font color="yellow">I had my chances.</font>

680
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:49,509
<font color="yellow">Especially when you came to see me to get Soon Hee out.</font>

681
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:54,769
<font color="yellow">I justified my decision and thought that time would take care of it all,</font>

682
00:44:56,509 --> 00:44:59,269
<font color="yellow">but our situation has worsened.</font>

683
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,609
<font color="yellow">I think this is my chance now.</font>

684
00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:18,609
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo.</font>

685
00:45:19,669 --> 00:45:20,669
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

686
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:23,909
<font color="yellow">I want to apologise to you on behalf of my dad.</font>

687
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:52,309
<font color="yellow">- Did the talk go well?
- Yes.</font>

688
00:45:58,909 --> 00:46:01,969
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad that I decided not to hate Seo Woo for all these years.</font>

689
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,069
<font color="yellow">Hye Jung, marry me.</font>

690
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:10,339
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- You don't want to?</font>

691
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,169
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

692
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,309
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's a bit much?</font>

693
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:17,339
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

694
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:19,739
<font color="yellow">Marriage isn't a joke.</font>

695
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:22,069
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me that so thoughtlessly?</font>

696
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:25,439
<font color="yellow">It wasn't thoughtless at all. I've been thinking about it for a while.</font>

697
00:46:25,439 --> 00:46:29,069
<font color="yellow">Still, this is wrong. There was nothing romantic about it.</font>

698
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:32,039
<font color="yellow">I thought you hated those things.</font>

699
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:33,869
<font color="yellow">Why would I hate it?</font>

700
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,769
<font color="yellow">That's right. Why did I think you hated it?</font>

701
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,069
<font color="yellow">I don't.</font>

702
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:39,569
<font color="yellow">Should I do it again?</font>

703
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:41,169
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

704
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,639
<font color="yellow">Don't you have something to say to me?</font>

705
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:50,869
<font color="yellow">Fine, it's not because I want to hear you say it.</font>

706
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:52,169
<font color="yellow">I already know how you feel.</font>

707
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:56,009
<font color="yellow">But you should learn how to express yourself.</font>

708
00:46:58,339 --> 00:46:59,439
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to say it.</font>

709
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:01,669
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

710
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:03,339
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem right today.</font>

711
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,939
<font color="yellow">I want the lights to be darker.</font>

712
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:07,809
<font color="yellow">You're funny.</font>

713
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:15,669
<font color="yellow">I'm happy.</font>

714
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,609
<font color="yellow">You surprise me when I least expect it.</font>

715
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:22,639
<font color="yellow">I'm holding back because we're at work.</font>

716
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,109
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

717
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:46,239
<font color="yellow">President Jin, Prof. Hong would like to see you.</font>

718
00:47:56,969 --> 00:47:58,609
<font color="yellow">I liked you, Prof. Hong.</font>

719
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:00,869
<font color="yellow">I had no idea you'd stab me in the back.</font>

720
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,009
<font color="yellow">I'd like to come back.</font>

721
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,709
<font color="yellow">You seem to think you have the upper hand now,</font>

722
00:48:07,109 --> 00:48:08,139
<font color="yellow">but don't flatter yourself.</font>

723
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:10,239
<font color="yellow">I have the recording of your conversation with Dr Yoo.</font>

724
00:48:10,869 --> 00:48:12,869
<font color="yellow">I have no reason to do as you say.</font>

725
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:16,069
<font color="yellow">However, I'll show respect since you're still the president.</font>

726
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:20,409
<font color="yellow">Should I come back after you step down?</font>

727
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,739
<font color="yellow">Then you'll never come back.</font>

728
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,309
<font color="yellow">Nothing must have gone your way recently.</font>

729
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:27,809
<font color="yellow">I hope this goes the way you want it to.</font>

730
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:41,209
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo is waiting for you.</font>

731
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:52,109
<font color="yellow">I just met Prof. Hong.</font>

732
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:55,409
<font color="yellow">Are you working as a team to get back at me?</font>

733
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,569
<font color="yellow">I'll quit now.</font>

734
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,169
<font color="yellow">I take back all the curses I cast on you.</font>

735
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:04,039
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

736
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:06,439
<font color="yellow">It was a hard decision to make.</font>

737
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,809
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live my life free from you.</font>

738
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:14,569
<font color="yellow">I'm here to end what I've started.</font>

739
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:16,839
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to thank you?</font>

740
00:49:16,939 --> 00:49:18,769
<font color="yellow">No, please don't.</font>

741
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:20,709
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say a thing.</font>

742
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:24,069
<font color="yellow">I'm just here to get closure.</font>

743
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:28,439
<font color="yellow">I've learned a lot from you.</font>

744
00:49:43,309 --> 00:49:44,509
<font color="yellow">Who does she think she is?</font>

745
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,969
<font color="yellow">Chairman is being released on bail and you should go see him.</font>

746
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,109
