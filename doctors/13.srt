222
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,940
<font color="yellow">I think his laughing is a sickness.</font>

223
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,510

224
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,210

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,140
<font color="yellow">- Why didn't you know?
- Call the Prosecutors' Office.</font>

308
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,830
<font color="yellow">The prosecutor who took on the case...</font>

309
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,340
<font color="yellow">is a VIP member of our health programme.</font>

310
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,210
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

311
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,480
<font color="yellow">I hope it doesn't turn into a bigger problem.</font>

312
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,016
<font color="yellow">Why is there so much noise about our hospital these days?</font>

313
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,910
<font color="yellow">People are asking if doctors are hired through connections.</font>

314
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,810
<font color="yellow">It's because of the news. Someone said the same thing to me too.</font>

315
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,456
<font color="yellow">Who even wants to work as a resident in Neurosurgery these days?</font>

316
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,070
<font color="yellow">They have no idea how tough the job is.</font>

317
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,070
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

318
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,210
<font color="yellow">did you hear that Dr Choi's webtoon could be published?</font>

319
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,740
<font color="yellow">Isn't he so impressive?</font>

320
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,240
<font color="yellow">He's also doing a great job as a first-year resident.</font>

321
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,086
<font color="yellow">I was wondering why he's been out of it. That's what he was busy with.</font>

322
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,140
<font color="yellow">This little...</font>

323
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,540
<font color="yellow">- You should be nice to him.
- Why do you say that?</font>

324
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,770
<font color="yellow">That way, you'll benefit if he becomes a bestselling author.</font>

325
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,510
<font color="yellow">I must say that Kang Soo is quick-witted.</font>

326
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,910
<font color="yellow">Joong Dae is the problem.</font>

327
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
<font color="yellow">What did I do?</font>

328
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,480
<font color="yellow">Get off me! Gosh, you're so heavy. Go away.</font>

329
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,670
<font color="yellow">Why is Patient Ahn Se Yeong still on warfarin?</font>

330
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,740
<font color="yellow">- That shouldn't be the case.
- Did you double-check?</font>

331
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,270
<font color="yellow">I think Kang Soo did.</font>

332
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,510
<font color="yellow">Why did you make my precious Kang Soo do it? It's your job.</font>

333
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,940
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

334
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,270
<font color="yellow">Go check it right now.</font>

335
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
<font color="yellow">- Go.
- Okay.</font>

336
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,610
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

337
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,070
<font color="yellow">Is Kang Soo good at drawing?</font>

338
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,070
<font color="yellow">He has hypothalamic hamartoma.</font>

339
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,630
<font color="yellow">It is a case of gelastic seizures.</font>

340
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,140
<font color="yellow">You did a good job.</font>

341
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,710
<font color="yellow">- What's that look?
- I got two compliments today.</font>

342
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,480
<font color="yellow">One was from this boy, and the other from you.</font>

343
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,480
<font color="yellow">How did you become like this?</font>

344
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,910
<font color="yellow">- Why? How do I look now?
- I'm beginning to pity you.</font>

345
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,350
<font color="yellow">Pitying someone has nothing to do with loving someone, right?</font>

346
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,310
<font color="yellow">- No.
- I knew you'd say that.</font>

347
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,210
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for me?</font>

348
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,210
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for Hye Jung?</font>

349
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,540
<font color="yellow">You know my weaknesses so well.</font>

350
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,230
<font color="yellow">I should meet this patient's guardian.</font>

351
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,990
<font color="yellow">I heard that this patient's little brother is Prof. Hong's patient.</font>

352
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,910
<font color="yellow">- What's his condition?
- I don't know.</font>

353
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,410
<font color="yellow">That patient's MRI result should be out by now.</font>

354
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,740
<font color="yellow">Call them.</font>

355
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,840
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- I hate you.</font>

356
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,070
<font color="yellow">I hate you terribly,</font>

357
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,940
<font color="yellow">but I also like you.</font>

358
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,810
<font color="yellow">I like you so much.</font>

359
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,070
<font color="yellow">Why do you like me?</font>

360
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,110
<font color="yellow">Why do you like me so much?</font>

361
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,070
<font color="yellow">- It's because you like what I have.
- That's how it started.</font>

362
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,980
<font color="yellow">I liked you because you have more to offer than me.</font>

363
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,670
<font color="yellow">Most of the guys who liked me in the past...</font>

364
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,270
<font color="yellow">were attracted to me because of what I have.</font>

365
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,070
<font color="yellow">With you, I don't have to worry about that.</font>

366
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,750
<font color="yellow">Look deep into your heart and find out...</font>

367
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,310
<font color="yellow">whether it's love...</font>

368
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,610
<font color="yellow">or just a feeling of relief.</font>

369
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,310
<font color="yellow">How are the two different?</font>

370
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,540
<font color="yellow">Trust and love are two different emotions.</font>

371
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,010
<font color="yellow">When you love someone,</font>

372
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,410
<font color="yellow">you can go until the end even if you don't trust the person.</font>

373
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,970
<font color="yellow">That's too foolhardy.</font>

374
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,910
<font color="yellow">That's precisely why people love.</font>

375
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,640
<font color="yellow">Don't get flustered when you get caught while being lovey-dovey.</font>

376
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,470
<font color="yellow">Just say that you're talking as a staff member and a fellow.</font>

377
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,770
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a perfect alibi?</font>

378
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,870
<font color="yellow">When lovey-dovey? We're not kids.</font>

379
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,670
<font color="yellow">- You know that this isn't enough.
- You're not getting anything else.</font>

380
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,510
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Patient Nam Dal. Age seven.</font>

381
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,210
<font color="yellow">Have you checked his MRI result yet?</font>

382
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,910
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

383
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,770
<font color="yellow">His older brother is Dr Jung's patient.</font>

384
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,890
<font color="yellow">It looks like we need to talk about the two patients.</font>

385
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,710
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

386
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,340
<font color="yellow">The wind feels nice.</font>

387
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,170
<font color="yellow">I spent extra time to do my hair today, but it's so windy.</font>

388
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,110
<font color="yellow">Shall I fix it for you?</font>

389
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,140
<font color="yellow">Dr Yoo!</font>

390
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,970
<font color="yellow">- Hey, what's up?
- I have to talk to Dr Yoo.</font>

391
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,540
<font color="yellow">- Good for you.
- It's not like that.</font>

392
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,540
<font color="yellow">I'll see you inside. Trust is important.</font>

393
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:25,040
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
- Promise me that you won't kill me.</font>

394
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,240
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

395
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,440
<font color="yellow">This is me?</font>

396
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,070
<font color="yellow">- Am I this ugly?
- Gosh, what are you talking about?</font>

397
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,970
<font color="yellow">My character is much prettier than you.</font>

398
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,740
<font color="yellow">Her looks aren't modelled after you.</font>

399
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,286
<font color="yellow">I just took a bit of inspiration from your story.</font>

400
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:46,370
<font color="yellow">You have a lot to say when you used my story without any permission?</font>

401
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,070
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you that I can make you super famous.</font>

405
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,440

407
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,440
<font color="yellow">No, I just came too. Have a seat. Have a seat and take a look.</font>

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,970
<font color="yellow">What do you think it is?</font>

412
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,510
<font color="yellow">It's medulloblastoma.</font>

413
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,416
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that? She says it's medulloblastoma.</font>

414
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,510
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you think? We're diagnosing.</font>

416
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,870
<font color="yellow">But it feels very different.</font>

417
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,340
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

418

419

422
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,070
<font color="yellow">- Any family history?
- Nothing significant.</font>

423
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
<font color="yellow">Then let's talk to the patient's guardian...</font>

424
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,170
<font color="yellow">and decide how to go about it.</font>

425
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,970
<font color="yellow">You should talk to the guardian since you'll be in the surgery.</font>

426
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

<font color="yellow">This tumour occurs...</font>

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,710
<font color="yellow">in vermis cerebelli and fourth ventricle.</font>

431
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,840
<font color="yellow">It causes nausea, migraine, hydrocephalus...</font>

<font color="yellow">and even motor disturbance.</font>

<font color="yellow">The Administrative Office will get in touch with you.</font>

448
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,620
<font color="yellow">I guess you're burdened because of the medical bill.</font>

607
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,070
<font color="yellow">He'd like to see you.</font>

608
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,270
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

609
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,616
<font color="yellow">How do you like working at this hospital? Do you like it?</font>

610
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

611
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,770
<font color="yellow">I feel like Seo Woo is having a hard time working...</font>

612
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,090
<font color="yellow">because she isn't flexible and takes things too seriously.</font>

613
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,880
<font color="yellow">Why don't you be friends since you're the same age?</font>

614
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,540
<font color="yellow">I heard from the Communication Department...</font>

615
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,910
<font color="yellow">that SBC's "Focus People" is going to come film you.</font>

616
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,070
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

617
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,910
<font color="yellow">I already turned it down because I don't seem fit for it.</font>

618
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,540
<font color="yellow">Why would you say that?</font>

619
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,100
<font color="yellow">We all have to work together when the hospital is facing crises.</font>

620
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,940
<font color="yellow">Seo Woo would love to do something like that, but she doesn't qualify.</font>

621
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:02,640
<font color="yellow">I'll believe you'll do it. It was nice meeting you.</font>

622
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,210
<font color="yellow">I like young doctors.</font>

623
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,270
<font color="yellow">This is my life.</font>

624
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,580
<font color="yellow">Not everything is served to me on a silver platter.</font>

625
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

626
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,110
<font color="yellow">Drive me home today.</font>

627
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,770
<font color="yellow">I like this.</font>

628
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,380
<font color="yellow">I was feeling down, but you just made me happy.</font>

629
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,240
<font color="yellow">What? Why were you feeling down?</font>

630
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,510
<font color="yellow">I had a talk with President Jin and Seo Woo.</font>

631
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,810
<font color="yellow">It's better to watch our lives from afar.</font>

632
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,856
<font color="yellow">It's cruel when you see it from up close.</font>

633
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,740
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to be part of my life?</font>

634
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,310
<font color="yellow">I will gladly become part of it.</font>

635
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,840
<font color="yellow">Then let's go.</font>

636
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,210
<font color="yellow">- Please get in.
- What an honour!</font>

637
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,670
<font color="yellow">Watch your head.</font>

638
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:12,110
<font color="yellow">I started the adventure of becoming part of someone's life.</font>

639
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,770
<font color="yellow">My heart is fluttering.</font>

640
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,010
<font color="yellow">I try not to,</font>

641
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,240
<font color="yellow">but you come to my mind when I face hardships.</font>

642
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,970
<font color="yellow">Why can't it be me?</font>

643
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,010
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

644
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,240
<font color="yellow">You and I are good together.</font>

645
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,240
<font color="yellow">We know each other so well.</font>

646
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,740
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

647
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,110
<font color="yellow">The problem is me, not you.</font>

648
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know how good we look together?</font>

649
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,340
<font color="yellow">You're tall.</font>

650
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,240
<font color="yellow">I'm the perfect height for someone as tall as you. Look.</font>

651
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,610
<font color="yellow">Our heights match. I like how tall you are.</font>

652
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,770
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say, now that you admitted it.</font>

653
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,680
<font color="yellow">My height was the only thing I was confident about.</font>

654
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,380
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

655
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,110
<font color="yellow">People are going to see.</font>

656
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,710
<font color="yellow">Who cares whether someone sees me or not?</font>

657
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,040
<font color="yellow">People like us have two choices.</font>

658
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,670
<font color="yellow">We can either do what our parents want or not.</font>

659
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,040
<font color="yellow">We have to give them something satisfactory when we decide not to.</font>

660
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,170
<font color="yellow">You can't do that.</font>

661
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,440
<font color="yellow">No, I can't.</font>

662
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,270
<font color="yellow">Nothing I do can live up to their expectations.</font>

663
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,740
<font color="yellow">Do you know why?</font>

664
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,640
<font color="yellow">Expectations are a form of greed you set up...</font>

665
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,010
<font color="yellow">to your standard and hope someone else will fulfil.</font>

666
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,770
<font color="yellow">My dad is a good person.</font>

667
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,310
<font color="yellow">He used to be when I was young.</font>

668
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,540
<font color="yellow">You should go home.</font>

669
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,510
<font color="yellow">Stop whining like a little kid...</font>

670
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,770
<font color="yellow">and break away from your parents.</font>

671
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,210
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

672
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,110
<font color="yellow">No, I...</font>

673
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,940
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

674
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,710
<font color="yellow">Got it.</font>

675
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,880
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Yes?</font>

676
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,210
<font color="yellow">Do you feel like eating right now?</font>

677
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,270
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you get a CT scan when Kim In Yeong is drowsy?</font>

678
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,070
<font color="yellow">I told Nurse Hyun to do it.</font>

679
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,740
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you do it?
- When did you tell me?</font>

680
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,270
<font color="yellow">I called you early this morning.</font>

681
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,040
<font color="yellow">I didn't get a call.</font>

682
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:51,910
<font color="yellow">You have to give me an official order for that.</font>

683
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,670
<font color="yellow">I'll go check on it.</font>

684
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,140
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

685
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,310
<font color="yellow">You made Kang Soo do your work earlier, and now you're blaming her?</font>

686
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:04,410
<font color="yellow">I'm not making excuses. I'm telling you the truth.</font>

687
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,310
<font color="yellow">Do you have problems...</font>

688
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,230
<font color="yellow">communicating with nurses and the other doctors?</font>

689
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,770
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how to communicate?</font>

690
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,930
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take responsibility if something happens to the patient?</font>

691
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,910
<font color="yellow">Can't you pull yourself together?</font>

692
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,800
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why are you standing up?</font>

693
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:24,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! Leave the rice.</font>

694
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,670
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

695
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,270
<font color="yellow">I think you're being too hard on him.</font>

696
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,740
<font color="yellow">How am I being hard on him?</font>

697
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,610
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to prevent you from making mistakes later.</font>

698
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,540
<font color="yellow">- Have one of these.
- Good boy.</font>

699
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,670
<font color="yellow">That was garlic.</font>

700
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,910
<font color="yellow">It'll make you a better person.</font>

701
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,340
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

702
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,540
<font color="yellow">- Did you come by yourself?
- Yes.</font>

703
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,386
<font color="yellow">Please give me something to drink and a lot of food to go with it.</font>

704
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

705
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,310
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

706
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,940
<font color="yellow">If anyone asks for me,</font>

707
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,340
<font color="yellow">especially from the hospital,</font>

708
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,240
<font color="yellow">tell them I'm not here.</font>

709
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,540
<font color="yellow">I can't tell them that.</font>

710
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,740
<font color="yellow">Anyone can see you're here.</font>

711
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,840
<font color="yellow">Is he crying?</font>

712
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,910
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here?
- Hi. Did you take a shower?</font>

713
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:52,240
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Are you homeless?</font>

714
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,270
<font color="yellow">You can't suddenly show up here like this.</font>

715
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:57,370
<font color="yellow">I'm tired. Bring me something cold.</font>

716
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,170
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

717
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,710
<font color="yellow">I heard you like girls with a story.</font>

718
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,910
<font color="yellow">Don't fall for me.</font>

719
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,770
<font color="yellow">I don't fall for girls with just any story.</font>

720
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,750
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you not to fall for me.</font>

721
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,740
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of stories.</font>

722
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,270
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry now.</font>

723
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,910
<font color="yellow">Please stop coming to my place. You are making me miserable.</font>

724
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,470
<font color="yellow">Yoon Do, your uncle is here!</font>

725
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:22,770
<font color="yellow">In Joo. You're here too.</font>

726
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you two are driving me nuts.</font>

727
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,310
<font color="yellow">Uncle, please stop coming to my place.</font>

728
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,591
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep coming here when you have your own place?</font>

729
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,840
<font color="yellow">I'm lonely.</font>

730
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:33,670
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

731
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,240
<font color="yellow">I like coming here these days.</font>

732
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,540
<font color="yellow">Likewise. We're both divorced singles, so it's sort of...</font>

733
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,340
<font color="yellow">awkward for only the two of us to hang out.</font>

734
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,410
<font color="yellow">Exactly. The two of us will look pathetic together.</font>

735
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:43,410
<font color="yellow">That youngster helps us look not so pathetic.</font>

736
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,010
<font color="yellow">And most importantly, teasing him is so much fun.</font>

737
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,510
<font color="yellow">Great minds think alike. You're my best friend, indeed.</font>

738
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,140
<font color="yellow">I will be sure to get a girlfriend.</font>

739
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,610
<font color="yellow">I'll make her stay here so that no one can come by like this.</font>

740
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,870
<font color="yellow">Do it.</font>

741
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,840
<font color="yellow">But I must say you aren't really the type...</font>

742
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,140
<font color="yellow">that girls like because of your personality.</font>

743
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,340
<font color="yellow">- Aunt.
- Did you buy instant cup noodles?</font>

744
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,340
<font color="yellow">If you did, I'll tell you that you're a pretty nice guy.</font>

745
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,470
<font color="yellow">I'll go buy them then.</font>

746
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,770
<font color="yellow">- Now?
- No! Tomorrow.</font>

747
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,640
<font color="yellow">In Joo.</font>

748
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,140
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

749
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,610
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

750
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
<font color="yellow">Help me with this.</font>

751
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,770
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- You like these things.</font>

752
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,690
<font color="yellow">Protecting and looking after people. Am I wrong?</font>

753
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,540
<font color="yellow">You know too much about me.</font>

754
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,310
<font color="yellow">I learned a lot about you when you devastated me.</font>

755
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:50,940
<font color="yellow">You still don't know how to let go of grudges.</font>

756
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,170
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

757
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:05,850
<font color="yellow">It could've seen as a bit suggestive.</font>
