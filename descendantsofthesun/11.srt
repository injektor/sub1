37
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,250
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're right.</font>

38
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,910

39
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,550

43
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,950

47
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,750
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a good thing to be young and healthy,</font>

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,210
<font color="yellow">since you have a high level of immunity?</font>

49
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,510
<font color="yellow">It's ironic,</font>

50
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,180
<font color="yellow">but having a high level of immunity can cause a problem, too.</font>

51
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,450
<font color="yellow">Then what do we do?</font>

52
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,480
<font color="yellow">Is there no way?</font>

53
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,410
<font color="yellow">I'll try everything possible to help fight it.</font>

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,510
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best not to lose against it.</font>

55
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,350
<font color="yellow">Fighting against a virus is a doctor's battle.</font>

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,810
<font color="yellow">I'm reassured to have such a reliable comrade.</font>

63

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,050
<font color="yellow">- Here's the list of contacts.
- Stop right there.</font>

158
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,710
<font color="yellow">Just stand there. Stay behind the desk.</font>

159
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,810
<font color="yellow">What about Lieutenant Yoon? How is she doing?</font>

160
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,580
<font color="yellow">- She looks okay.
- Does she?</font>

161
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
<font color="yellow">Okay. Send her to the US military hospital as soon as possible.</font>

162
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,310
<font color="yellow">We made a request for cooperation, so we should send her when we can.</font>

163
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,210
<font color="yellow">Medicube is the fixed medical treatment facility for the M3 virus.</font>

164
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,810
<font color="yellow">- We can't send patients anywhere.
- Do you think I don't know that?</font>

165
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,350
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

166
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,310
<font color="yellow">Just move her before things get worse.</font>

167
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,250
<font color="yellow">We are just following the reaction manual.</font>

168
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,250
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to go back home?</font>

169
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,450
<font color="yellow">Do you want to live here forever?</font>

170
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,680
<font color="yellow">It is a war against an epidemic which we can't see with our eyes.</font>

171
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,980
<font color="yellow">It is our new enemy, and this is an actual battle.</font>

172
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,480
<font color="yellow">If we don't follow the rules,</font>

173
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,310
<font color="yellow">we can't win the battle.</font>

174
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,880
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so stubborn on sticking to the principles?</font>

175
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,750
<font color="yellow">Fine, do as you planned.</font>

176
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,150
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

177
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,950
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to go back home if any one of you get sick.</font>

178
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,880
<font color="yellow">Make sure not to get sick.</font>

179
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,850
<font color="yellow">- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sir.</font>

180
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,480
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

181
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,780
<font color="yellow">At the Mowuru area, which recently suffered from an earthquake,</font>

182
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,610
<font color="yellow">two Koreans are confirmed to have been infected...</font>

183
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,280
<font color="yellow">with the communicable disease, the M3 virus.</font>

184
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,150
<font color="yellow">One male and one female patient are confirmed to be infected.</font>

185
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,310
<font color="yellow">I'm calling Mo Yeon.</font>

186
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,510
<font color="yellow">I'm calling Doctor Song.</font>

187
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,510
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she answering my call?</font>

188
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,110
<font color="yellow">His cellphone is off.</font>

189
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,280
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Did Chi Hun answer his phone?</font>

190
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,510
<font color="yellow">Mother, it's me.</font>

191
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,750
<font color="yellow">Did you hear the news?</font>

192
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,150
<font color="yellow">It is an epidemic now.</font>

193
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,810
<font color="yellow">Why didn't they come back when I sent them a flight?</font>

194
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,210
<font color="yellow">So now you're upset?</font>

195
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,180
<font color="yellow">I'm already dying inside.</font>

196
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,750
<font color="yellow">- You are here.
- Yes, I'm here.</font>

197
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,850
<font color="yellow">You're not doing anything, so I came to you.</font>

198
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,880
<font color="yellow">Do you think you have time to have a vain discussion?</font>

199
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,080
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to fly to Urk in a chartered plane?</font>

200
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,210
<font color="yellow">Why should I go there? There's a disease spreading around that area.</font>

201
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,480
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

202
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,050
<font color="yellow">Aren't you worried about them?</font>

203
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,310
<font color="yellow">How can you call yourself the director of this hospital?</font>

204
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,750
<font color="yellow">How can you send my son to a place like that?</font>

205
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,580
<font color="yellow">Bring him back right in front of me within 24 hours.</font>

206
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,050
<font color="yellow">Hang on. Get off me and let's talk about it calmly.</font>

207
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,710
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Stop her.</font>

208
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,050
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

209
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,010
<font color="yellow">How can you say that to my precious daughter-in-law? She's pregnant.</font>

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,580
<font color="yellow">I think I'm a widow now.</font>

211
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,950
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that? You are fired.</font>

212
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,580
<font color="yellow">I'm going to cut ties with your mother, too.</font>

213
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,850
<font color="yellow">She's not my friend any more.</font>

214
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,950
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Hang on.</font>

215
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,710
<font color="yellow">I will bring him back. I will.</font>

216
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,380
<font color="yellow">I will bring him myself.</font>

217
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,880
<font color="yellow">Would you feel better...</font>

218
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,510
<font color="yellow">if I bring him back by tomorrow?</font>

219
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,410
<font color="yellow">By tomorrow. Okay?</font>

220
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,550
<font color="yellow">Doctor Pyo, it's me. Let me ask you a favour.</font>

221
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,480
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for some old materials that I can't find online.</font>

222
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,750
<font color="yellow">There's too much to scan.</font>

223
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,780
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to take pictures and send them over.</font>

224
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,750
<font color="yellow">What are they?</font>

225
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,080
<font color="yellow">Wow, do doctors study even when they are sick?</font>

226
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,280
<font color="yellow">Soldiers go to war even when they are sick, don't they?</font>

227
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,750
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

228
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,110
<font color="yellow">Do you want to eat something?</font>

229
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,110
<font color="yellow">Do you want something else to eat?</font>

230
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,380
<font color="yellow">No. I just want to know more about this virus. That's why I'm eating.</font>

231
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,010
<font color="yellow">It requires physical strength.</font>

232
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,510
<font color="yellow">If I were a soldier,</font>

233
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,450
<font color="yellow">this would be a war.</font>

234
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,180
<font color="yellow">Anyway, the dinner was good.</font>

235
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,510
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

236
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,350
<font color="yellow">I hope you will win the war. Salute.</font>

237
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,780
<font color="yellow">Can he survive?</font>

238
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,780
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, he came around.</font>

239
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,650
<font color="yellow">But his breathing isn't stable yet.</font>

240
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,980
<font color="yellow">The following 2 to 3 three days will be critical for him.</font>

241
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,250
<font color="yellow">They found diamonds in his stomach.</font>

242
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,280
<font color="yellow">He had this much inside.</font>

243
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,180
<font color="yellow">So I was right. That's what I saw.</font>

244
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,580
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. How much would this much cost?</font>

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,910
<font color="yellow">There were about 30 pieces of 2-carat-diamond of the first water.</font>

246
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,780
<font color="yellow">- It'd be about 2 million dollars.
- 2 million...</font>

247
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,080
<font color="yellow">Two million dollars?</font>

248
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,280
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

249
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,280
<font color="yellow">Two million dollars?</font>

250
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,750
<font color="yellow">Is it enough to risk his life?</font>

251
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,910
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you.</font>

252
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,080
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

253
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,780
<font color="yellow">I heard you went to the Corps Command.</font>

254
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,150
<font color="yellow">When are we getting the blood test results?</font>

255
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,880
<font color="yellow">We will get the results by tomorrow afternoon.</font>

256
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,610
<font color="yellow">They will send us a fax as soon as they get the results.</font>

257
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,550
<font color="yellow">It is sooner than I expected.</font>

258
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,010
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

259
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,210
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

260
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,250
<font color="yellow">Speaking of blood test results,</font>

261
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,450
<font color="yellow">what is your blood type?</font>

262
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,580
<font color="yellow">Your ideal type.</font>

263
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,650
<font color="yellow">Try one more.</font>

264
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,110
<font color="yellow">A beauty?</font>

265
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,410
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

266
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,150
<font color="yellow">A doll?</font>

267
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,510
<font color="yellow">I lose.</font>

268
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,880
<font color="yellow">I lost.</font>

269
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,480
<font color="yellow">I just gave it a shot.</font>

270
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,980
<font color="yellow">You cheer me up when I'm down.</font>

271
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,850
<font color="yellow">I didn't have to do it, but I did.</font>

272
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,080
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

273
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,780
<font color="yellow">Win your battle, so that I don't have to worry.</font>

274
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,180
<font color="yellow">I want to hold hands and hug you.</font>

275
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,580
<font color="yellow">It's tough to hold back.</font>

276
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,750
<font color="yellow">Did you have to go there?</font>

277
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,350
<font color="yellow">That was a joke to put you at ease.</font>

278
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,780
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it wasn't a joke.</font>

279
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,810
<font color="yellow">I'm off to fight now.</font>

280
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,710
<font color="yellow">So what's your blood type?</font>

281
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,550
<font color="yellow">The type that would get me locked up in your heart?</font>

282
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,620
<font color="yellow">Go. Go as fast as you can. Run.</font>

283
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,620
<font color="yellow">- I can say worse.
- Just go.</font>

284
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,850
<font color="yellow">Go on inside.</font>

285
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,680
<font color="yellow">Her breathing and temperature are normal.</font>

286
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,380
<font color="yellow">(YOU'RE CURED NOW. WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE SAFE TOMORROW.)</font>

287
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,280
<font color="yellow">(THERE'S A VIRUS HERE.)</font>

288
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,350
<font color="yellow">Not again.</font>

289
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,120
<font color="yellow">This is Lieutenant Yoon. The isolation ward lost power.</font>

290
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,750
<font color="yellow">Is there a back-up generator?</font>

291
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,450
<font color="yellow">The problem's with the wires. I'll be right there.</font>

292
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,180
<font color="yellow">The cafeteria's also...</font>

293
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,810
<font color="yellow">Mr Jin's ventilator.</font>

294
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,280
<font color="yellow">- Pack up for me.
- Okay.</font>

295
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,280
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

296
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,980
<font color="yellow">- Pass me the sedative, please.
- Okay.</font>

297
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,810
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

298
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,910
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming in.
- Don't!</font>

299
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,980
<font color="yellow">You'll become infected.</font>

300
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,450
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of things in here.</font>

301
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,380
<font color="yellow">Do what you can to get the power back.</font>

302
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,780
<font color="yellow">10 minutes. It'll take 10 minutes.</font>

303
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,410
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

304
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,310
<font color="yellow">My goodness!</font>

305
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,910
<font color="yellow">Get me a stethoscope.</font>

306
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,980
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

307
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,910
<font color="yellow">His pulse is weak. Get a portable breathing pump.</font>

308
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,010
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

309
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,480
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

310
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,050
<font color="yellow">- He bit you.
- One, two, three.</font>

311
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,780
<font color="yellow">Get that looked at.</font>

312
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,510
<font color="yellow">What happened? Are you okay?</font>

313
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,410
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me. I'm out of breath.</font>

314
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,120
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

315
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,580
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

316
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,510
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

317
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,810
<font color="yellow">Two minutes. He bit Chi Hun's arm.</font>

318
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,710
<font color="yellow">- Chi Hun.
- Later.</font>

319
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,050
<font color="yellow">One, two, three. One, two, three.</font>

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,580
<font color="yellow">You know wounds increase the risk of getting infected, don't you?</font>

322
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,150
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

323
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,380
<font color="yellow">Do you also know that...</font>

324
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,880
<font color="yellow">he could have died if it weren't for you?</font>

325
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,080
<font color="yellow">You're a real doctor now.</font>

326
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,280
<font color="yellow">I'll take some blood.</font>

327
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,750
<font color="yellow">We're done cleaning up. We'll go now.</font>

328
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

329
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,280
<font color="yellow">Will he...</font>

330
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,350
<font color="yellow">get infected?</font>

331
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,850
<font color="yellow">Let's hope not.</font>

332
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,010
<font color="yellow">He'll be isolated for now.</font>

333
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,120
<font color="yellow">Chi Hun.</font>

334
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,450
<font color="yellow">You were awesome earlier.</font>

335
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,580
<font color="yellow">You looked like a doctor.</font>

336
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,710
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

337
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,950
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

338
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,810
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt?</font>

339
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,580
<font color="yellow">Do you have another wound?</font>

340
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,610
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

341
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,880
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now.</font>

342
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,680
<font color="yellow">I'm okay now.</font>

343
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,480
<font color="yellow">Now I can call my family.</font>

344
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,080
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

345
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,380
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

346
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,710
<font color="yellow">You're in isolation?</font>

347
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,810
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

348
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,250
<font color="yellow">Are you infected by the M3 virus?</font>

349
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,810
<font color="yellow">I could be, but not yet.</font>

350
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,980
<font color="yellow">I guess I was isolated to become a real doctor.</font>

351
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,510
<font color="yellow">That's what you say after calling for the first time in a month?</font>

352
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,210
<font color="yellow">Do you know how worried I was?</font>

353
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,510
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to divorce me.</font>

354
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,880
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

355
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,610
<font color="yellow">That's not a bad idea.</font>

356
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,850
<font color="yellow">You could get a fortune in alimony.</font>

357
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,710
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

358
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,010
<font color="yellow">I love you, Hee Eun.</font>

359
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,450
<font color="yellow">I love you so much.</font>

360
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,980
<font color="yellow">It really is you.</font>

361
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,250
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

362
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,410
<font color="yellow">They just left the city.</font>

363
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,680
<font color="yellow">They'll reach the UN camp in three hours.</font>

364
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,610
<font color="yellow">Look after the kids for me.</font>

365
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,450
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang.</font>

366
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,380
<font color="yellow">The blood test results just came in by fax.</font>

367
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,610
<font color="yellow">Everyone's negative.</font>

368
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,980
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

369
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,110
<font color="yellow">That's great news. Does Captain Yoo know?</font>

370
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,250
<font color="yellow">He passed me that fax.</font>

371
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,580
<font color="yellow">He went to release Sergeant Major Seo.</font>

372
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,010
<font color="yellow">She just fell asleep...</font>

373
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,550
<font color="yellow">after bossing the others around and eating some food.</font>

374
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,510
<font color="yellow">I thought so.</font>

375
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,710
<font color="yellow">In some rare cases,</font>

376
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,950
<font color="yellow">an infected person could show no symptoms.</font>

377
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,450
<font color="yellow">She's a rare woman.</font>

378
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,280
<font color="yellow">I hope that's the case.</font>

379
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,780
<font color="yellow">Have you heard?</font>

380
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,150
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

381
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,580
<font color="yellow">Thanks to my fast response,</font>

382
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,050
<font color="yellow">there are no further cases in the city.</font>

383
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
<font color="yellow">Once everyone is vaccinated,</font>

384
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:54,780
<font color="yellow">the threat level will be lowered, from Warning to Concern.</font>

385
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,250
<font color="yellow">For that,</font>

386
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,780
<font color="yellow">the UN wants to thank the Mowuru Company Commander,</font>

387
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:02,180
<font color="yellow">which is none other than me.</font>

388
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,110
<font color="yellow">They don't really have to, but they say they want to.</font>

389
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,050
<font color="yellow">Did you hear me?</font>

390
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,750
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

391
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,050
<font color="yellow">Thanks to my speedy response to the situation...</font>

392
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:25,780
<font color="yellow">Snoopy to Big Boss, there's an incident in the cafeteria.</font>

393
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,750
<font color="yellow">I repeat, an incident in the cafeteria.</font>

394
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,310
<font color="yellow">We request your assistance.</font>

395
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,910
<font color="yellow">It's good to see familiar faces.</font>

396
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,280
<font color="yellow">A former comrade.</font>

397
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,380
<font color="yellow">My lifesaver.</font>

398
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,410
<font color="yellow">And my little red rose.</font>

399
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,850
<font color="yellow">How are you, Fatima?</font>

400
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,280
<font color="yellow">Do you think he's here to get tested for the M3 virus?</font>

401
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,010
<font color="yellow">The virus?</font>

402
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,410
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Doctor.</font>

403
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,380
<font color="yellow">We already tested negative.</font>

404
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,150
<font color="yellow">The US Army came in advance to test me.</font>

405
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:56,710
<font color="yellow">Apparently,</font>

406
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,450
<font color="yellow">I can't be sick.</font>

407
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,150
<font color="yellow">They love me more than when I was a Delta Force Captain.</font>

408
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,950
<font color="yellow">Be quick, and watch your mouth.</font>

409
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,280
<font color="yellow">Don't ever say...</font>

410
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,050
<font color="yellow">we are on the same side.</font>

411
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:12,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

412
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,380
<font color="yellow">We can catch up next time.</font>

413
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,380
<font color="yellow">I'm just here to see my Korean friend.</font>

414
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,210
<font color="yellow">He was very ill.</font>

415
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,150
<font color="yellow">Mr Jin.</font>

416
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,180
<font color="yellow">Can I see him now?</font>

417
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,810
<font color="yellow">Your friends aren't welcome here.</font>

418
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,280
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

419
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,950
<font color="yellow">get lost.</font>

420
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,150
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

421
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,310
<font color="yellow">I can always catch up with him next time.</font>

422
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,980
<font color="yellow">But just one question.</font>

423
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,650
<font color="yellow">I heard my stuff is here.</font>

424
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,680
<font color="yellow">It's very expensive,</font>

425
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,550
<font color="yellow">sparkly,</font>

426
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,580
<font color="yellow">and women adore it.</font>

427
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,910
<font color="yellow">Can I see that instead?</font>

428
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,680
<font color="yellow">This is not a lost and found.</font>

429
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:07,350
<font color="yellow">I will give you 10 seconds...</font>

430
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,550
<font color="yellow">to get out of my face.</font>

431
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,180
<font color="yellow">10.</font>

432
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,010
<font color="yellow">Nine.</font>

433
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,580
<font color="yellow">You should've opened him up.</font>

434
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,110
<font color="yellow">It's immune globulin.</font>

435
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,450
<font color="yellow">I couldn't visit my friend empty-handed.</font>

436
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,550
<font color="yellow">This is for you, Doctor.</font>

437
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,980
<font color="yellow">Please bring him back.</font>

438
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,810
<font color="yellow">I have a lot to say to him.</font>

439
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,180
<font color="yellow">Everyone's busy,</font>

440
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,450
<font color="yellow">so we shall go.</font>

441
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,250
<font color="yellow">He knows what the US Army's up to.</font>

442
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,080
<font color="yellow">And he checked our status, too.</font>

443
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,850
<font color="yellow">Strengthen the security around the barracks.</font>

444
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,950
<font color="yellow">Is that guy the jerk who was going to do something to her?</font>

445
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,980
<font color="yellow">Look after Sang Hyun for me.</font>

446
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,450
<font color="yellow">I'll stay with her for a while.</font>

447
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,880
<font color="yellow">The blood test results came back.</font>

448
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,780
<font color="yellow">What does...</font>

449
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,910
<font color="yellow">Sang Hyun's say?</font>

450
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,650
<font color="yellow">The results are back.</font>

451
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,280
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

452
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,650
<font color="yellow">Then I'm free to go.</font>

453
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,550
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

454
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,110
<font color="yellow">Not yet. I haven't told you anything yet.</font>

455
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,510
<font color="yellow">A fever, headache, cough and chest pains.</font>

456
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:21,510
<font color="yellow">My early symptoms were similar to the M3 or Ebola virus,</font>

457
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,080
<font color="yellow">but my skin's still flawless,</font>

458
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,110
<font color="yellow">and you still look beautiful,</font>

459
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,910
<font color="yellow">so my eyesight is fine.</font>

460
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,010
<font color="yellow">My symptoms were from another, more common virus.</font>

461
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,580
<font color="yellow">It's called a cold.</font>

462
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, you fool.</font>

463
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,550
<font color="yellow">You had a cold.</font>

464
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,380
<font color="yellow">I was so worried.</font>

465
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,680
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go of me.</font>

466
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,210
<font color="yellow">You hugged me first.</font>

467
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,010
<font color="yellow">I'm regretting it now.</font>

468
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,910
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

469
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,110
<font color="yellow">Catch my cold, catch my cold.</font>

470
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,350
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

471
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,610
<font color="yellow">Read this first.</font>

472
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,280
<font color="yellow">I thought about this...</font>

473
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,810
<font color="yellow">harder than anything I'd ever thought about in my life.</font>

474
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,010
<font color="yellow">I think I found the answer.</font>

475
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,350
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

476
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,280
<font color="yellow">"Cefotaxime"?</font>

477
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,850
<font color="yellow">A cure for Lyme disease.</font>

478
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,080
<font color="yellow">Where's Doctor Kang?</font>

479
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,450
<font color="yellow">According to reports written in...</font>

480
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,680
<font color="yellow">2007 and 2011 by Medipeace doctors who were in western Africa,</font>

481
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,780
<font color="yellow">it worked on an average of 85 percent of the cases.</font>

482
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,180
<font color="yellow">54 out of 63 people and 73 out of 85 were cured.</font>

483
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,610
<font color="yellow">How did you find this out?</font>

484
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,710
<font color="yellow">Cefotaxime isn't usually used for this.</font>

485
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,480
<font color="yellow">I analysed the DNA of the M3 virus, and looked up...</font>

486
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,410
<font color="yellow">the molecular and chemical formula of antibiotics.</font>

487
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,610
<font color="yellow">Then I did a comprehensive search that led me to...</font>

488
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,450
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- No.</font>

489
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,410
<font color="yellow">I looked up all the annual M3 virus reports.</font>

490
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,410
<font color="yellow">Slowly and meticulously.</font>

491
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,950
<font color="yellow">I respect you.</font>

492
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,910
<font color="yellow">Let's test it.</font>

493
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,410
<font color="yellow">But on our list of supplies, Cefotaxime...</font>

494
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,710
<font color="yellow">It isn't there.</font>

495
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:55,950
<font color="yellow">Then call Daniel and ask...</font>

496
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,710
<font color="yellow">- I did.
- Already?</font>

497
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,650
<font color="yellow">It'll come with the vaccines.</font>

498
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,750
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

499
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:06,610
<font color="yellow">Did you two fight?</font>

500
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,550
<font color="yellow">I'm playing hard to get.</font>

501
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,050
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Do you know how worried she was about you?</font>

503
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,250
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

504
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,550
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

505
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sick.</font>

506
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,010
<font color="yellow">Haven't you heard?</font>

507
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,850
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

508
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,210
<font color="yellow">But you never called.</font>

509
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,850
<font color="yellow">You have a 50 percent chance of surviving.</font>

510
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,710
<font color="yellow">As a father,</font>

511
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,110
<font color="yellow">or as a commanding officer,</font>

512
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,310
<font color="yellow">there's nothing I can do.</font>

513
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,380
<font color="yellow">So I waited for you to call.</font>

514
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,150
<font color="yellow">I'm that powerless.</font>

515
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,550
<font color="yellow">I won't lose.</font>

516
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,850
<font color="yellow">I will fight and live.</font>

517
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,710
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Dad.</font>

518
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,910
<font color="yellow">I won't. You will fight.</font>

519
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,280
<font color="yellow">I hope you will.</font>

520
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,880
<font color="yellow">Instead, just do two things for me.</font>

521
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,610
<font color="yellow">Do you have that many favours to ask?</font>

522
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,250
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

523
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,020
<font color="yellow">forgive me, Dad.</font>

524
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,080
<font color="yellow">Before coming here,</font>

525
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
<font color="yellow">I threatened you that...</font>

526
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,950
<font color="yellow">you'd lose both...</font>

527
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,080
<font color="yellow">a daughter and a lieutenant.</font>

528
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,750
<font color="yellow">I apologise for saying that.</font>

529
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,520
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

530
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,310
<font color="yellow">Just get better.</font>

531
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,410
<font color="yellow">What's the second?</font>

532
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,450
<font color="yellow">When I get better...</font>

533
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,710
<font color="yellow">If I really don't die,</font>

534
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,610
<font color="yellow">let Sergeant Major Seo stay in the army.</font>

535
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,080
<font color="yellow">Don't make him leave, Dad.</font>

536
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,550
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

537
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,350
<font color="yellow">I overheard everything.</font>

538
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,480
<font color="yellow">Yoon Myeong Ju, go outside.</font>

539
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,780
<font color="yellow">However, I won't have a sergeant major as a son-in-law.</font>

540
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,380
<font color="yellow">You have to quit being a soldier.</font>

541
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,980
<font color="yellow">I, Sergeant Major Seo,</font>

542
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,750
<font color="yellow">was granted permission to date Lieutenant Yoon.</font>

543
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,950
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

544
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,080
<font color="yellow">Did he really give permission?</font>

545
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

546
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,710
<font color="yellow">I loved being with him so much,</font>

547
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,380
<font color="yellow">so I pretended not to know.</font>

548
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,150
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

549
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,750
<font color="yellow">You're always worried about me.</font>

550
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,980
<font color="yellow">But I'm always worried about him.</font>

551
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,520
<font color="yellow">That sounds more like my daughter.</font>

552
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,710
<font color="yellow">You're back to your usual self, making me worried, like always.</font>

553
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,710
<font color="yellow">I'll call you again later, Dad.</font>

554
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,350
<font color="yellow">I think it's time to get an injection.</font>

555
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,950
<font color="yellow">I have to hang up now.</font>

556
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,410
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Yoon.</font>

557
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,150
<font color="yellow">Myeong Ju.</font>

558
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,950
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

559
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,150
<font color="yellow">She has a fever of 41Â°C.</font>

560
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,080
<font color="yellow">The fever reducer won't work.</font>

561
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,250
<font color="yellow">This is what we were worried about.</font>

562
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,680
<font color="yellow">- Overreaction of the immune system?
- Yes, the cytokine storm.</font>

563
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,880
<font color="yellow">Steroid, please.</font>

564
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,710
<font color="yellow">Fill the tub with ice.</font>

565
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,650
<font color="yellow">We need to bring her fever down for her to be alive.</font>

566
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,810
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

567
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,410
<font color="yellow">Responding to symptoms that pop up is the only thing we can only do.</font>

568
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,380
<font color="yellow">Essentially, we have to hope that Sang Hyun's cure works.</font>

569
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,950
<font color="yellow">Has the cure not arrived yet?</font>

570
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,650
<font color="yellow">It will arrive with the preventive vaccines, so it should soon...</font>

571
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,650
<font color="yellow">It's Daniel.</font>

572
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,780
<font color="yellow">Hello? Have you arrived?</font>

573
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,710
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

574
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,050
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

575
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,080
<font color="yellow">The vehicle carrying the preventive vaccines was stolen.</font>

576
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,350
<font color="yellow">The vehicle...</font>

577
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,350
<font color="yellow">also carries Lieutenant Yoon's cure.</font>

578
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:35,850
<font color="yellow">Who on earth stole it?</font>

579
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,710
<font color="yellow">If we don't get it back in an hour, it will be too late.</font>

580
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,780
<font color="yellow">It'll take at least four hours if the hospital sends it again.</font>

581
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,310
<font color="yellow">Could there be another way?</font>

582
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,150
<font color="yellow">We need to find the thief.</font>

583
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,750
<font color="yellow">Communications security, I'll call back...</font>

584
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,980
<font color="yellow">Captain Big Boss, come in.</font>

585
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,110
<font color="yellow">This is Argus, over.</font>

586
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

587
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,810
<font color="yellow">Bring back the medicine. Now.</font>

588
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,520
<font color="yellow">I'm a business man, not a soldier.</font>

589
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,410
<font color="yellow">Instead of making orders,</font>

590
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,380
<font color="yellow">let's make a deal.</font>

591
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,980
<font color="yellow">Bring me the diamonds, if you want to get your medicines back.</font>

592
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,680
<font color="yellow">I think I know where...</font>

593
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,650
<font color="yellow">Myeong Ju's medicine is.</font>

594
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,520
<font color="yellow">This is Snoopy.</font>

595
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,210
<font color="yellow">We have located everyone.</font>

596
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,880
<font color="yellow">Where's Argus?</font>

597
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,080
<font color="yellow">He's busy.</font>

598
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,110
<font color="yellow">Where is it?</font>

599

600
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,780
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

601
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,750
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

602
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,020
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

603
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,450
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the diamonds.</font>

604
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,410
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

605
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,780
<font color="yellow">Scream if it hurts. It's all right.</font>

606
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,050
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

607
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,480
<font color="yellow">I can hold it.</font>

608
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,250
<font color="yellow">Hold on a little longer.</font>

609
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,750
<font color="yellow">The cure will be here soon.</font>

610
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,080
<font color="yellow">- Doctor Kang.
- The medicine must be here.</font>

611
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,250
<font color="yellow">Stay with her.</font>

612
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,910
<font color="yellow">What are you guys doing?</font>

613
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,780
<font color="yellow">Official duty.</font>

614
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,950
<font color="yellow">This girl that you are taking care of is under arrest...</font>

615
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,050
<font color="yellow">for dealing stolen medicine in the black market.</font>

616
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,280
<font color="yellow">The accomplice has already confessed.</font>

617
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,080
<font color="yellow">There must be a misunderstanding.</font>

618
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,710
<font color="yellow">She didn't steal it.</font>

619
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,710
<font color="yellow">We gave those medicines to Fatima. I gave them to her. So...</font>

620
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,150
<font color="yellow">you have no reason to arrest her now.</font>

621
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,480
<font color="yellow">Even if you had given it to her,</font>

622
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,410
<font color="yellow">she's still under arrest for dealing in the black market.</font>

623
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,880
<font color="yellow">Are you that foreign doctor who was at the scene?</font>

624
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,280
<font color="yellow">I don't understand why there's no cure even with advances in medicine.</font>

625
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,110
<font color="yellow">It's because it's a medicine that doesn't sell.</font>

626
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,810
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't sell, it doesn't make money.</font>

627
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,380
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't make money, they don't make it.</font>

628
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,110
<font color="yellow">People are dying. How can they not make it because it isn't profitable?</font>

629
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,750
<font color="yellow">That's why people like us...</font>

630
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,180
<font color="yellow">do things that we're told not to do.</font>

631
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,310
<font color="yellow">And we go to places where we're told not to go.</font>

632
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,750
<font color="yellow">We're hoping for the world to change.</font>

633
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,310
<font color="yellow">After taking this medicine,</font>

634
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,710
<font color="yellow">I hope Doctor Yoon gets cured like magic.</font>

635
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,250
<font color="yellow">This is a herb that brings down fever.</font>

636
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,780
<font color="yellow">Let's decoct it well.</font>

637
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,050
<font color="yellow">Let's make magic happen.</font>

638
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,310
<font color="yellow">Will that...</font>

639
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,020
<font color="yellow">be helpful?</font>

640
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,150
<font color="yellow">We need to do everything we can.</font>

641
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,080
<font color="yellow">Whether it's Western medicine, Oriental medicine...</font>

642
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,750
<font color="yellow">or a prayer.</font>

643
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:47,810
<font color="yellow">To medical team. Medical team, please gather in front of Medicube.</font>

644
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,210
<font color="yellow">The cure has arrived. Over.</font>

645
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:50,910
<font color="yellow">All right. Over.</font>

646
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,250
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

647
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,680
<font color="yellow">- Nurse Ha.
- Thank you for your work.</font>

648
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,150
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you for your work.</font>

649
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,680
<font color="yellow">Her fever is 37.5Â°C.</font>

650
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,510
<font color="yellow">Where is Doctor Kang?</font>

651
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,280
<font color="yellow">I can't find her.</font>

652
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,350
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

653
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,850
<font color="yellow">Yesterday, when the police came to arrest Fatima,</font>

654
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,950
<font color="yellow">she went to the police station with them.</font>

655
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,210
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

656
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,980
<font color="yellow">Are you sure they were the Urk police?</font>

657
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:06,310
<font color="yellow">It's just too bad that you got hurt.</font>

658
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,610
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

659
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,410
<font color="yellow">I mean, the doctor can't treat you now.</font>

660
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,550
<font color="yellow">Get your hands off her.</font>

661
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:24,750
<font color="yellow">Can't you see what's going on here?</font>

662
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,580
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

663
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:27,910
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

664
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,150
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to get your girlfriend killed?</font>

665
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,510
<font color="yellow">It's my turn to give the orders now, Captain.</font>

666
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,510
<font color="yellow">The only person these guys won't kill...</font>

667
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,050
<font color="yellow">is me.</font>

668
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,280
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

669
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,080
<font color="yellow">Finally, you understand.</font>

670
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,710
<font color="yellow">All right, let's talk.</font>

671
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,780
<font color="yellow">The weapons will be delivered to North Urk at midnight.</font>

672
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:20,510
<font color="yellow">My own country will try to kill me once the delivery is made.</font>

673
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,050
<font color="yellow">But I want to live, and I want the money.</font>

674
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,580
<font color="yellow">So get me away out of this country...</font>

675
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,650
<font color="yellow">after the delivery is made tonight.</font>

676
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,050
<font color="yellow">That's all I want. It's my escape route.</font>

677
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,310
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

678
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,180
<font color="yellow">Save me like you did the last time, Captain.</font>

679
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,580
<font color="yellow">Tonight at 2am.</font>

680
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,550
<font color="yellow">You can't be too early,</font>

681
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,850
<font color="yellow">and you can't be too late.</font>

682
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,480
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't want to...</font>

683
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,310
<font color="yellow">sell her on a personal grudge.</font>

684
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,610
<font color="yellow">I will kill you with my own hands.</font>

685
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,180
<font color="yellow">I will make sure...</font>

686
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:03,710
<font color="yellow">to kill you with my own hands.</font>

687
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:09,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to learn Korean just for you.</font>

688
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:11,880
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

689
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,580
<font color="yellow">I have such good memories of Urk.</font>

690
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,210
<font color="yellow">And you...</font>

691
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:51,750
<font color="yellow">are the perfect person to spend my last night with.</font>

692
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,980
<font color="yellow">This is Big Boss, do you copy?</font>

693
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,710
<font color="yellow">Mo Yeon, listen carefully to what I say.</font>

694
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,210
<font color="yellow">I will make sure I find you and save you.</font>

695
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,350
<font color="yellow">You do know that I'm a great worker, right?</font>

696
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,710
<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon.</font>

697
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,880
<font color="yellow">So don't be afraid, and don't cry.</font>

698
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,210
<font color="yellow">Just wait for me.</font>

699
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,210
<font color="yellow">I'll be there soon.</font>

700
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,110
<font color="yellow">And I also look forward to seeing you, Big Boss.</font>

701
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,950
<font color="yellow">Are you insane?</font>

702
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,280
<font color="yellow">Get a grip, will you?</font>

703
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,250
<font color="yellow">A hostage rescue?</font>

704
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:40,110
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're Team Alpha right now?</font>

705
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,680
<font color="yellow">You're just a dispatched soldier.</font>

706
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,580
<font color="yellow">You're here publicly on a peaceful mission.</font>

707
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,410
<font color="yellow">I must go, Sir.</font>

708
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,050
<font color="yellow">- And I will go.
- You aren't going anywhere!</font>

709
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,610
<font color="yellow">I must go, Sir.</font>

710
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,410
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back, Sir.
- Hey.</font>

711
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,380
<font color="yellow">Do you see this?</font>

712
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,380
<font color="yellow">Do you see this blinking light?</font>

713
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,650
<font color="yellow">Line two is Commander Yoon, and line three is the Blue House.</font>

714
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,010
<font color="yellow">What will you do with this?</font>

715
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,710
<font color="yellow">Salute. This is Lieutenant-Colonel Park...</font>

716
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,850
<font color="yellow">I'm the Chief of Foreign Affairs and National Security.</font>

717
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,180
<font color="yellow">Let me be straight with you.</font>

718
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,350
<font color="yellow">Is it an abduction?</font>

719
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,450
<font color="yellow">It's not exactly an abduction, but it's something similar...</font>

720
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,550
<font color="yellow">It is an abduction, Sir.</font>

721
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:31,310
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

722
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,510
<font color="yellow">That's not what we heard from the CIA.</font>

723
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,980
<font color="yellow">It is an abduction, Sir.</font>

724
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:37,980
<font color="yellow">The abductors are...</font>

725
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,280
<font color="yellow">a total of 14 people, all armed.</font>

726
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:44,050
<font color="yellow">Skip that. I'll hear about the situation from the US Army.</font>

727
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,710
<font color="yellow">I called to tell you this.</font>

728
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,850
<font color="yellow">Keep this confidential until everything becomes perfectly clear,</font>

729
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,550
<font color="yellow">and be on standby.</font>

730
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,310
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- We have no time to standby.</font>

731
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,880
<font color="yellow">We have no time to waste!</font>

732
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,810
<font color="yellow">I will begin the rescue mission...</font>

733
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,750
<font color="yellow">according to the emergency operation guidelines.</font>

734
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,380
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

735
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,950
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear that you must keep it confidential and be on standby?</font>

736
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,710
<font color="yellow">Look here, Captain Yoo.</font>

737
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,710
<font color="yellow">Just because I let things pass with the VIP case before,</font>

738
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,310
<font color="yellow">do you think you can just ignore my words?</font>

739
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,910
<font color="yellow">This nation did not put a gun in your hands for this.</font>

740
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:24,510
<font color="yellow">This isn't a matter of whether one person dies or not.</font>

741
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
<font color="yellow">This problem is at a national level.</font>

742
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,550
<font color="yellow">If the nation is indifferent to a single person's death,</font>

743
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,210
<font color="yellow">that seems more problematic.</font>

744
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,850
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure which nation you serve,</font>

745
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,410
<font color="yellow">but I will serve my nation.</font>

746
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,610
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

747
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,080
<font color="yellow">Stop right there. If anyone is there, stop Si Jin!</font>

748
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,480
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

749
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,850
<font color="yellow">You must standby, Sir.</font>

750
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,910
<font color="yellow">Are those gates strong?</font>

751
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,610
<font color="yellow">I've crashed a few cars before,</font>

752
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,480
<font color="yellow">and those gates will break.</font>

753
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:11,850
<font color="yellow">You mustn't do this, Sir.</font>

754
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:13,480
<font color="yellow">Move, if you don't want to get hurt.</font>

755
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,250
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to push forward.</font>

756
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,050
<font color="yellow">Captain Yoo!</font>

757
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,780
<font color="yellow">He wants to talk to you. It's the commander of Special Forces.</font>

758
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,180
<font color="yellow">Salute, this is Captain Yoo Si Jin.</font>

759
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,550
<font color="yellow">I'll give you exactly three hours.</font>

760
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:37,280
<font color="yellow">I won't know where you are for the next three hours.</font>

761
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,050
<font color="yellow">For those three hours, you aren't the captain of Team Alpha,</font>

762
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,310
<font color="yellow">nor are you the company commander of Mowuru Company.</font>

763
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:45,410
<font color="yellow">You are also not a captain of the ROK Army.</font>

764
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,050
<font color="yellow">Do you object?</font>

765
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:48,950
<font color="yellow">I do not, Sir.</font>

766
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,110
<font color="yellow">That's all.</font>

767
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,810
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

768
00:53:51,834 --> 00:54:03,834
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU.</font>

769
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,950
<font color="yellow">How's Myeong Ju?</font>

770
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,480
<font color="yellow">She's not conscious yet, but her temperature is dropping.</font>

<font color="yellow">I think the medicine worked.</font>

772
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:12,910
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

773
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,380
<font color="yellow">I will be going out for a bit.</font>

774
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,810
<font color="yellow">I am sorry...</font>

775
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,910
<font color="yellow">for not seeing you before I leave.</font>

776

<font color="yellow">Why are you going out?</font>

777
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:31,150
<font color="yellow">Myeong Ju is awake. I'll contact you again.</font>

<font color="yellow">Good luck, Captain.</font>

781
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,410
<font color="yellow">Well done, Doctor.</font>

782
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,280
<font color="yellow">If you need anything, you just let me know.</font>

783
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,680
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why you brought me here.</font>

784
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,550
<font color="yellow">But if you were going to ask for money, forget about it.</font>

785
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,550
<font color="yellow">I have more debt than assets.</font>

<font color="yellow">In English.</font>

787
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,410
<font color="yellow">I can't have you think that I'm a nice guy.</font>

788
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,280
<font color="yellow">Especially if I'm holding a gun.</font>

789
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,550
<font color="yellow">Now, how many times have I told you?</font>

790
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,710
<font color="yellow">You're more likely to get shot...</font>

791
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,180
<font color="yellow">being around a guy with a gun.</font>

792
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,980
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

793
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,580
<font color="yellow">Big Boss. He's smart, funny...</font>

794
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,050
<font color="yellow">and mysterious.</font>

795
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,780
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

796
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:26,680
<font color="yellow">he has a lot of secrets.</font>

797
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,780
<font color="yellow">He'll disappear from time to time.</font>

798
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,780
<font color="yellow">He'll be hard to contact.</font>

799
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,280
<font color="yellow">And then, one day...</font>

800
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,980
<font color="yellow">He'll never come back.</font>

801
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:51,050
<font color="yellow">You should break up with him now.</font>

802
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,450
<font color="yellow">This is an advice,</font>

803
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,210
<font color="yellow">not a warning.</font>

804
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,480
<font color="yellow">That kind of thing should be said with a roll of cash...</font>

805
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:12,910
<font color="yellow">and a cup of water on the side.</font>

806
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,180
<font color="yellow">You can't make me do that without giving me anything.</font>

807
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,110
<font color="yellow">You must be dying to know what I'm saying.</font>

808
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,850

810
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,350
<font color="yellow">You are not easy.</font>

811
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,850
<font color="yellow">Big Boss, answer me.</font>

812
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,180
<font color="yellow">Big Boss, answer me.</font>

813
