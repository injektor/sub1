40
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,650

48
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,020
<font color="yellow">That really hurts.</font>

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,850
<font color="yellow">His heartbeat has returned.</font>

50
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,450
<font color="yellow">Si Jin, can you hear me?</font>

51
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,590
<font color="yellow">Do you know where we are?</font>

52
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,320
<font color="yellow">Can you see me?</font>

53
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,020
<font color="yellow">Can you hear me?</font>

54
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,950
<font color="yellow">What about Senior Lieutenant Ahn?</font>

55
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

56
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,220
<font color="yellow">The other wounded patient...</font>

57
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,720
<font color="yellow">who came here with me.</font>

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,290
<font color="yellow">Is he alive?</font>

59
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,290
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

60
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,950
<font color="yellow">Who on earth is that?</font>

61
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,790
<font color="yellow">This is not the time to worry for others.</font>

62
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,020
<font color="yellow">You just came back from the dead.</font>

63
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,690
<font color="yellow">If the cardiac arrest had lasted another minute, you'd be dead.</font>

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,150
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have been able to save you.</font>

65
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,550
<font color="yellow">Your pretty face...</font>

66
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,190
<font color="yellow">seems very familiar.</font>

67
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,990
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

68
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,550
<font color="yellow">Anyways,</font>

69
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,150
<font color="yellow">what happened to the other patient?</font>

70
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,650
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare get up right now.</font>

71
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,190
<font color="yellow">Who on earth is he?</font>

72
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,320
<font color="yellow">Did you fight against him?</font>

73
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,450
<font color="yellow">Is he the person who made you like this?</font>

74
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,620
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

75
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,150
<font color="yellow">He's a friend of mine.</font>

76
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,750
<font color="yellow">We're not too close though.</font>

77
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,590
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

78
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,920
<font color="yellow">The patient who came here with Captain Yoo...</font>

79
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,450
<font color="yellow">is making a fuss.</font>

80
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,150
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,450
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

82
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,320
<font color="yellow">Don't come close.</font>

83
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,150
<font color="yellow">If you touch me,</font>

84
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,620
<font color="yellow">I'll kill all of you.</font>

85
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,320
<font color="yellow">If you don't receive medical attention,</font>

86
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,690
<font color="yellow">you will be the first to die.</font>

87
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,250
<font color="yellow">You have lost too much blood.</font>

88
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,020
<font color="yellow">Keep quiet.</font>

89
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,420
<font color="yellow">We will put the gun down.</font>

90
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,490
<font color="yellow">Let's get you treated first.</font>

91
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,990
<font color="yellow">I can't trust a doctor from South Korea.</font>

92
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,320
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,950
<font color="yellow">I die in the operating room?</font>

94
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,750
<font color="yellow">You should be worried about what's outside the operating room.</font>

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,620
<font color="yellow">Doctors are the only people...</font>

96
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,690
<font color="yellow">who don't care about which side you're on.</font>

97
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,790
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

98
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,650
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

99
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,390
<font color="yellow">- He's in shock from blood loss.
- Dr Song is on call in room four.</font>

100
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,420
<font color="yellow">- Send him there immediately.
- Okay.</font>

101
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,390
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a favour.</font>

102
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,250
<font color="yellow">I want you...</font>

103
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,490
<font color="yellow">to conduct the operation.</font>

104
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,750
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.</font>

105
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,590
<font color="yellow">After his scans are complete, keep him restrained.</font>

106
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,350
<font color="yellow">Put a cast on him if needed.</font>

107
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,020
<font color="yellow">Use force if he resists.</font>

108
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,350
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, there is no tension pneumothorax or cardiac compression.</font>

109
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,090
<font color="yellow">His cardiac rhythms are normal, too.</font>

110
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,320
<font color="yellow">Scalpel, please.</font>

111
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,890
<font color="yellow">What is that? It doesn't seem to be a bullet wound.</font>

112
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,550
<font color="yellow">There is something implanted under the skin.</font>

113
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,250
<font color="yellow">Ahn Jung Joon is from the 11th Corps of the North Korean Special Forces.</font>

114
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,190
<font color="yellow">He's assigned to guard dignitaries.</font>

115
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,590
<font color="yellow">I heard he would be off duty during the second meeting.</font>

116
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,450
<font color="yellow">A furloughed soldier got caught...</font>

117
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,120
<font color="yellow">in a firefight in Seoul in broad daylight?</font>

118
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,820
<font color="yellow">Senior Lieutenant Ahn was being pursued.</font>

119
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,850
<font color="yellow">They were pursuing him.</font>

120
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,020
<font color="yellow">Given the arms, mobility, physical conditioning...</font>

121
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,650
<font color="yellow">and tactics that they displayed,</font>

122
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,590
<font color="yellow">it is evident that they received special warfare training.</font>

123
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,550
<font color="yellow">They don't seem to be from the US.</font>

124
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,350
<font color="yellow">Maybe they're of Russian origin.</font>

125
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,990
<font color="yellow">They have been identified.</font>

126
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,820
<font color="yellow">They're military attached to the Matagonian embassy.</font>

127
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,620
<font color="yellow">They're embassy security?</font>

128
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,290
<font color="yellow">They said that Senior Lieutenant Ahn counterfeited a Matagonian passport.</font>

129
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,020
<font color="yellow">Hence, they were chasing after him.</font>

130
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,850
<font color="yellow">Embassy security personnel started a firefight over a false passport?</font>

131
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,620
<font color="yellow">That's the worst excuse I've heard.</font>

132
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,150
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid we have no choice.</font>

133
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,290
<font color="yellow">We don't have the authority to arrest them under international law.</font>

134
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,120
<font color="yellow">We should dig into Senior Lieutenant Ahn.</font>

135
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
<font color="yellow">The hospital has contacted us, Sir.</font>

136
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,850
<font color="yellow">Senior Lieutenant Ahn's operation is over.</font>

137
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,820
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

138
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,150
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

139
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,390
<font color="yellow">The operation?</font>

140
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,950
<font color="yellow">We have preserved his life.</font>

141
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,520
<font color="yellow">He's been moved to a rehabilitation ward.</font>

142
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,790
<font color="yellow">He is still unconscious.</font>

143
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,490
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about him.</font>

144
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,150
<font color="yellow">I have another patient who I just saved.</font>

145
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
<font color="yellow">That patient seems oblivious to his girlfriend.</font>

146
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,650
<font color="yellow">As far as I know, she was devastated...</font>

147
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,550
<font color="yellow">to see her boyfriend under cardiac arrest and covered in blood...</font>

148
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,950
<font color="yellow">just an hour ago.</font>

149
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,950
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,220
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

151
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,490
<font color="yellow">Are there no explanations?</font>

152
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,920
<font color="yellow">Is there nothing again?</font>

153
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,950
<font color="yellow">Are you not curious about how I feel?</font>

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,590
<font color="yellow">You seem to care much more about that other friend.</font>

155
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,090
<font color="yellow">Just wait until you recover.</font>

156
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,020
<font color="yellow">I just might kill you then.</font>

157
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,620
<font color="yellow">Maybe I shouldn't give this to you.</font>

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

159
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,820
<font color="yellow">Why is he coming here?</font>

160
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,150
<font color="yellow">Salute.</font>

161
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
<font color="yellow">We will cordon off this room from now on.</font>

162
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,190
<font color="yellow">Even doctors are unauthorised to enter without consent.</font>

163
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,520
<font color="yellow">Your cooperation will be appreciated.</font>

164
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,020
<font color="yellow">I heard you wanted to speak to me.</font>

165
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,990
<font color="yellow">I think Captain Yoo wanted me to perform the operation for this.</font>

166
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,020
<font color="yellow">It's from the body of the North Korean patient.</font>

167
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,790
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

168
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,150
<font color="yellow">There's a rumour that he's a North Korean.</font>

169
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,450
<font color="yellow">Should we be treating North Koreans?</font>

170
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,290
<font color="yellow">Of course, he's wounded.</font>

171
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,350
<font color="yellow">We took an oath.</font>

172
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,890
<font color="yellow">Weren't you scared?</font>

173
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,290
<font color="yellow">He was covered in blood with gunshot wounds.</font>

174
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,020
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure running into billboards drunk can't do that.</font>

175
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,020
<font color="yellow">I've seen worse at Urk.</font>

176
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,650
<font color="yellow">I've witnessed men staring down their gun barrels.</font>

177
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,550
<font color="yellow">Screaming, "Alert, alert."</font>

178
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,650
<font color="yellow">I've heard triggers clicking.</font>

179
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,520
<font color="yellow">"Hands up. Move and I'll shoot."</font>

180
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,150
<font color="yellow">Stop messing around. You made that up.</font>

181
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,650
<font color="yellow">I really want to kick you.</font>

182
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,320
<font color="yellow">Check the news.</font>

183
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,720
<font color="yellow">Politicians make me so angry.</font>

184
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ja Ae!</font>

185
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,320
<font color="yellow">I heard you were taken hostage.</font>

186
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,020
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? Are you hurt?</font>

187
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,250
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

188
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,790
<font color="yellow">I'll kill him myself.</font>

189
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,750
<font color="yellow">He was half-dead until you saved him, Sang Hyun.</font>

190
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,390
<font color="yellow">Was he the man I operated on?</font>

191
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,790
<font color="yellow">Heo Jun.</font>

192
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,390
<font color="yellow">Albert Schweitzer.</font>

193
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,090
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

194
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,620
<font color="yellow">I heard your boyfriend came in with the North Korean.</font>

195
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,920
<font color="yellow">There are men in black suits in the hallways.</font>

196
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,990
<font color="yellow">How can you date someone like him?</font>

197
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,450
<font color="yellow">What on earth does your boyfriend do?</font>

198
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,220
<font color="yellow">I wonder that myself.</font>

199
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,520
<font color="yellow">I don't know what he does.</font>

200
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,720
<font color="yellow">I'm off to see the director.</font>

201
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,850
<font color="yellow">What about these?</font>

202
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,690
<font color="yellow">Why didn't she comment on what I said?</font>

203
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,090
<font color="yellow">What are those?</font>

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,020
<font color="yellow">They're the personal belongings of the unidentified man.</font>

205
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,920
<font color="yellow">Then were all these made in North Korea?</font>

206
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,820
<font color="yellow">It's not working.</font>

207
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,120
<font color="yellow">A little lick can revive any dead pen.</font>

208
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,690
<font color="yellow">I'll take these.</font>

209
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,020
<font color="yellow">I'll be off then.</font>

210
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,950
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

211
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,720
<font color="yellow">He said that the pen is actually a poisoned syringe.</font>

212
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,090
<font color="yellow">I almost killed myself...</font>

213
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,520
<font color="yellow">just now.</font>

214
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,190
<font color="yellow">Doctor Song, are you okay?</font>

215
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,090
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

216
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,350
<font color="yellow">I told you to move.</font>

217
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,690
<font color="yellow">Gangnam has countless hospitals.</font>

218
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,750
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be Haesung?</font>

219
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,820
<font color="yellow">It's the most expensive hospital.</font>

220
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,820
<font color="yellow">This is official government business.</font>

221
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,290
<font color="yellow">Please cooperate.</font>

222
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,650
<font color="yellow">Here's their request, Sir.</font>

223
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,950
<font color="yellow">This should've come first.</font>

224
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,120
<font color="yellow">Right, Sir.</font>

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,750
<font color="yellow">What on earth does your boyfriend do...</font>

226
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,790
<font color="yellow">to merit an injury as official business?</font>

227
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,090
<font color="yellow">And who's the guy with him?</font>

228
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,420
<font color="yellow">Did those two fight?</font>

229
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,020
<font color="yellow">Who won?</font>

230
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,350
<font color="yellow">- I don't know.
- He lost, didn't he?</font>

231
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,020
<font color="yellow">It seems like he lost.</font>

232
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,320
<font color="yellow">I can fight, too. I served in the army.</font>

233
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,850
<font color="yellow">Did you really?</font>

234
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,590
<font color="yellow">- Who do you think I am?
- A draft dodger, Sir.</font>

235
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,290
<font color="yellow">That's not what I asked.</font>

236
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,250
<font color="yellow">Please be quiet.</font>

237
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,020
<font color="yellow">You quiet down. This is my hospital!</font>

238
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,550
<font color="yellow">You sort this out,</font>

239
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,150
<font color="yellow">whether as his physician or as his guardian.</font>

240
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

241
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,990
<font color="yellow">- Move.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

242
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,390
<font color="yellow">I'm Captain Yoo Si Jin...</font>

243
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,020
<font color="yellow">of the South Korean Special Forces.</font>

244
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,450
<font color="yellow">Senior Lieutenant Ahn Jung Joon.</font>

245
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,620
<font color="yellow">What is your affiliation?</font>

246
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,650
<font color="yellow">Why did you enter South Korea illegally?</font>

247
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,890
<font color="yellow">What is your mission?</font>

248
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,690
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is,</font>

249
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,950
<font color="yellow">the fact that you're here implies that you've failed.</font>

250
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,620
<font color="yellow">Is that correct?</font>

251
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,890
<font color="yellow">Senior Lieutenant Ahn Jung Joon.</font>

252
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,220
<font color="yellow">Under the Geneva Conventions, I'm charged to ask...</font>

253
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,850
<font color="yellow">if you wish to seek asylum.</font>

254
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,820
<font color="yellow">It's too difficult to hear your voice.</font>

255
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,250
<font color="yellow">You should've stayed at home if you were going to be this shy.</font>

256
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,520
<font color="yellow">Has he said anything at all?</font>

257
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,690
<font color="yellow">What I've reported was all, Sir.</font>

258
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,490
<font color="yellow">He asked to be sent North.</font>

259
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,490
<font color="yellow">He galloped all the way down here to ask to be sent back North?</font>

260
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,850
<font color="yellow">That makes no sense.</font>

261
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,020
<font color="yellow">I can't determine the reason.</font>

262
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,250
<font color="yellow">But since official routes through China or Russia were blocked,</font>

263
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,990
<font color="yellow">he chose the most dangerous and direct route south.</font>

264
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,990
<font color="yellow">Asylum is the only way out of this situation.</font>

265
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,690
<font color="yellow">We will welcome you warmly if you spit out the truth.</font>

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,750
<font color="yellow">We'll give you time to think. Make the best choice.</font>

267
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,390
<font color="yellow">Give him a hand.</font>

268
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,190
<font color="yellow">These were his personal belongings.</font>

269
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,520
<font color="yellow">If his holiday was a cover for a black operations mission,</font>

270
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,620
<font color="yellow">then this will give us an answer.</font>

271
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,350
<font color="yellow">I'll take this and decrypt it as soon as possible.</font>

272
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,550
<font color="yellow">The summit is coming up. Gosh, this is crazy.</font>

273
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,020
<font color="yellow">Has he said anything?</font>

274
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,390
<font color="yellow">Senior Lieutenant Ahn's still quiet. Captain Yoo's doing the talking.</font>

275
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,450
<font color="yellow">What's he saying?</font>

276
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,950
<font color="yellow">Is he urging him to negotiate by mentioning his family?</font>

277
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
<font color="yellow">Well, Sir...</font>

278
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,350
<font color="yellow">He's saying that adding vinegar gives it a zing...</font>

279
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,190
<font color="yellow">and mustard gives it a zap.</font>

280
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,590
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

281
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,020
<font color="yellow">They're talking about naengmyeon.</font>

282
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,090
<font color="yellow">It's Senior Lieutenant Ahn's exclusive recipe.</font>

283
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,950
<font color="yellow">Are you all out of your minds?</font>

284
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,090
<font color="yellow">There's a report due soon, and they're discussing condiments.</font>

285
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,720
<font color="yellow">How can a captain be so clueless about official protocols?</font>

286
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,620
<font color="yellow">Do you hear this?</font>

287
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,750
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do about this?</font>

288
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,250
<font color="yellow">This is Lieutenant Colonel Park Byeong Su.</font>

289
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,350
<font color="yellow">Okay, so...</font>

290
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,850
<font color="yellow">we don't know anything yet?</font>

291
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,190
<font color="yellow">Do you call that a report?</font>

292
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,590
<font color="yellow">The summit is tomorrow.</font>

293
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,820
<font color="yellow">The North Korean representative moved up his schedule...</font>

294
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,390
<font color="yellow">and is on his way right now.</font>

295
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,220
<font color="yellow">If we don't hand Ahn over by tomorrow morning,</font>

296
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,420
<font color="yellow">they will call off the summit.</font>

297
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,590
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

298
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,450
<font color="yellow">The North Korean representative has just entered Seoul.</font>

299
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,120
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

300
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,390
<font color="yellow">Is Pyeongyang that close to Seoul?</font>

301
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,590
<font color="yellow">I got it.</font>

302
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,850
<font color="yellow">Hello? Report in as soon as you have something for me.</font>

303
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,450
<font color="yellow">Understood?</font>

304
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,420
<font color="yellow">He's just a senior lieutenant, not a top general.</font>

305
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,020
<font color="yellow">It's ridiculous to think...</font>

306
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,690
<font color="yellow">that he's keeping leaders from both North and South up all night.</font>

307
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,850
<font color="yellow">Does this even make sense?</font>

308
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,460
<font color="yellow">What's his identity anyway?</font>

309
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,090
<font color="yellow">It is very likely that Ahn is wanted...</font>

310
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,650
<font color="yellow">by Interpol as a murder suspect.</font>

311
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,750
<font color="yellow">A murder suspect?</font>

312
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,890
<font color="yellow">It's not for terrorism or assassination?</font>

313
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,290
<font color="yellow">Two days ago in Tokyo,</font>

314
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,320
<font color="yellow">the main witness to a yakuza case...</font>

315
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,920
<font color="yellow">was going into court to testify.</font>

316
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,420
<font color="yellow">She was gunned down by a long-range sniper rifle.</font>

317
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,020
<font color="yellow">Is Senior Lieutenant Ahn a suspect for that murder?</font>

318
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
<font color="yellow">No, Sir.</font>

319
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,690
<font color="yellow">The sniper was found dead in an adjacent building,</font>

320
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,250
<font color="yellow">which was suspected to be his vantage point.</font>

321
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,290
<font color="yellow">Ahn is wanted for...</font>

322
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,720
<font color="yellow">murdering the sniper.</font>

323
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,220
<font color="yellow">Who was the murdered gunman?</font>

324
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,420
<font color="yellow">It's someone we know.</font>

325
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,650
<font color="yellow">It's Staff Sergeant Rhee Seok Jin.</font>

326
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,820
<font color="yellow">He served in the same battalion as Senior Lieutenant Ahn.</font>

327
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,890
<font color="yellow">He killed an ex-subordinate involved in a yakuza murder.</font>

328
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,960
<font color="yellow">It seems that was his mission.</font>

329
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,190
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

330
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,290
<font color="yellow">Did you find anything from the chip in his arm?</font>

331
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,120
<font color="yellow">It's protected by a very sophisticated code.</font>

332
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,790
<font color="yellow">It'll take a week to break it.</font>

333
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,850
<font color="yellow">The North wants us to hand him over by tomorrow morning.</font>

334
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,250
<font color="yellow">We'll most likely comply.</font>

335
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,990
<font color="yellow">- We don't have time.
- Getting him to talk is best.</font>

336
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,990
<font color="yellow">He knows you're listening in,</font>

337
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,850
<font color="yellow">so he's reluctant to open up.</font>

338
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,850
<font color="yellow">This is usually when...</font>

339
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,990
<font color="yellow">photos of his mother and family should come in handy.</font>

340
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,960
<font color="yellow">Let's try something else.</font>

341
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,590
<font color="yellow">I need Mo Yeon's help.</font>

342
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,990
<font color="yellow">I also need the chip.</font>

343
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,960
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the chip which is being analysed by NIS this very moment?</font>

344
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,350
<font color="yellow">Will it be hard to steal?</font>

345
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,290
<font color="yellow">I think we made a mistake.</font>

346
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,820
<font color="yellow">We should've made a copy first.</font>

347
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,650
<font color="yellow">Do you mean something like this?</font>

348
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
<font color="yellow">You're so smart.</font>

349
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,350
<font color="yellow">Shall I send the doctor up?</font>

350
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,920
<font color="yellow">In your wrist and thigh, I found pieces of bone...</font>

351
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,020
<font color="yellow">that were not removed after previous fractures.</font>

352
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,390
<font color="yellow">You have four gunshot wounds.</font>

353
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,090
<font color="yellow">Four new ones, I mean.</font>

354
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,690
<font color="yellow">What concerns me most...</font>

355
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,390
<font color="yellow">is the piece of shrapnel lodged close to your spine.</font>

356
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,120
<font color="yellow">If you leave it there, it can harm a nerve...</font>

357
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,990
<font color="yellow">and paralyse your lower body.</font>

358
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,220
<font color="yellow">Mr Ahn.</font>

359
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,850
<font color="yellow">It's a wonder you're still alive.</font>

360
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,250
<font color="yellow">Don't waste your one and only life.</font>

361
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,620
<font color="yellow">The fellow next to you is just like you.</font>

362
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,790
<font color="yellow">He's someone who's just as crazy.</font>

363
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,850
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to say this,</font>

364
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,420
<font color="yellow">but remember the soldier I met in Urk?</font>

365
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,750
<font color="yellow">- Who do you mean?
- You know,</font>

366
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,420
<font color="yellow">the one who yelled at me for operating on a dying man.</font>

367
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,750
<font color="yellow">That ugly person who disciplined you for it.</font>

368
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,720
<font color="yellow">He came to my team earlier...</font>

369
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,520
<font color="yellow">and interrogated us about every medicine and pill.</font>

370
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,550
<font color="yellow">Are we his subordinates or what? How dare he treat us like...</font>

371
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,890
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

372

374
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,120
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

375
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,120
<font color="yellow">What I'm trying to say is, don't you think...</font>

376
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,390
<font color="yellow">he noticed?</font>

377
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,490
<font color="yellow">I was so happy to see him.</font>

378
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,020
<font color="yellow">I almost ran up to hug him.</font>

379
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,220
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he knows.</font>

380
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,150
<font color="yellow">He's a great man.</font>

381
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,020
<font color="yellow">He truly is.</font>

382
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,120
<font color="yellow">How is your mother?</font>

383
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,220
<font color="yellow">What? Well,</font>

384
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,850
<font color="yellow">she boasts about what she cooks for me and spends my money.</font>

385
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,150
<font color="yellow">I need a private place to speak to Senior Lieutenant Ahn.</font>

386
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,390
<font color="yellow">She's very well.</font>

387
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,420
<font color="yellow">I wasn't able to greet her properly.</font>

388
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,350
<font color="yellow">Let's set a date.</font>

389
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,190
<font color="yellow">You pick the place to meet.</font>

390
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,020
<font color="yellow">Must I really?</font>

391
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,690
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

392
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,090
<font color="yellow">My mum won't like it either.</font>

393
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,250
<font color="yellow">I won't worry you.</font>

394
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,220
<font color="yellow">You don't keep your promises.</font>

395
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,220
<font color="yellow">It's a special request.</font>

396
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,020
<font color="yellow">From now on, don't abandon me because you're drunk.</font>

397
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,820
<font color="yellow">Mr Ahn, please come to the CT room in half an hour.</font>

398
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,620
<font color="yellow">I need to run a few more tests.</font>

399
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,750
<font color="yellow">Be on time. There's a long waiting list.</font>

400
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,390
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

401
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,420
<font color="yellow">Lieutenant Colonel?</font>

402
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,420
<font color="yellow">How can we meet like this?</font>

403
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,650
<font color="yellow">It's so good to see you.</font>

404
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,720
<font color="yellow">Let's just say that you hugged me.</font>

405
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,920
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

406
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,520
<font color="yellow">We always meet whenever there's an issue of national importance.</font>

407
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,250
<font color="yellow">We do. Excuse me, then.</font>

408
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,450
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

409
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,220
<font color="yellow">I have a long list of patients.</font>

410
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,890
<font color="yellow">I need 10 minutes.</font>

411
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,520
<font color="yellow">This is the only probable place without listening bugs.</font>

412
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,720
<font color="yellow">Listening bugs?</font>

413
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,320
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

414
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,920
<font color="yellow">It's best if you don't know.</font>

415
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,350
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

416
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,150
<font color="yellow">I work for the government.</font>

417
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,650
<font color="yellow">Does the government know about this?</font>

418
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,420
<font color="yellow">Promise me one thing.</font>

419
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,490
<font color="yellow">Even if the government denies me,</font>

420
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,920
<font color="yellow">promise that you will remember me.</font>

421
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,150
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

422
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,520
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

423
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,420
<font color="yellow">They can't listen in now, so speak freely.</font>

424
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,290
<font color="yellow">I betrayed my own side to arrange this.</font>

425
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,750
<font color="yellow">We have 10 minutes at most.</font>

426
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,690
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to help.</font>

427
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,450
<font color="yellow">This is your final chance.</font>

428
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,450
<font color="yellow">What's the issue?</font>

429
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,620
<font color="yellow">It's about Staff Sergeant Rhee Seok Jin.</font>

430
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,590
<font color="yellow">Why did you kill him?</font>

431
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,690
<font color="yellow">Return my belongings first.</font>

432
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,320
<font color="yellow">Do you mean this?</font>

433
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,790
<font color="yellow">Now it's my turn to ask.</font>

434
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,250
<font color="yellow">What's in that chip?</font>

435
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,790
<font color="yellow">We received a tip that our best Special Forces personnel...</font>

436
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,220
<font color="yellow">were being hired...</font>

437
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,690
<font color="yellow">by crime syndicates like the yakuza or mafia...</font>

438
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,020
<font color="yellow">as hit men commanding very high prices.</font>

439
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,820
<font color="yellow">The 13th North Star, mission accomplished.</font>

440
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,250
<font color="yellow">Confirm the transfer account.</font>

441
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,950
<font color="yellow">My mission...</font>

442
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,650
<font color="yellow">was to eliminate the traitors...</font>

443
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,020
<font color="yellow">and to find out about the person arranging the hits.</font>

444
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,520
<font color="yellow">Did you discover any evidence of the mastermind suspect?</font>

445
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,490
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask me?</font>

446
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,650
<font color="yellow">You must've seen for yourself.</font>

447
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,320
<font color="yellow">The code is too hard to break.</font>

448
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,020
<font color="yellow">What's the password?</font>

449
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,920
<font color="yellow">Even better, just tell me what's in it.</font>

450
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,550
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

451
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,820
<font color="yellow">My government will take care of its own issues.</font>

452
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,150
<font color="yellow">Your government...</font>

453
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,320
<font color="yellow">is already up to something.</font>

454
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,590
<font color="yellow">Commander Choe is on his way...</font>

455
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,320
<font color="yellow">to collect you this very instance.</font>

456
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,850
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow morning,</font>

457
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,450
<font color="yellow">we will hand you over to the North.</font>

458
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,420
<font color="yellow">Is this place bugged by any chance, too?</font>

459
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,450
<font color="yellow">No, not now.</font>

460
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,020
<font color="yellow">I can barely breathe in the ward.</font>

461
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,090
<font color="yellow">It'll be over soon. Thanks for your help.</font>

462
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,420
<font color="yellow">I really hate your guts.</font>

463
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,520
<font color="yellow">Did you get to speak to your friend?</font>

464
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,750
<font color="yellow">Yes, thanks to you.</font>

465
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,650
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

466
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,920
<font color="yellow">His name is Ahn Jung Joon.</font>

467
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,690
<font color="yellow">He's a senior lieutenant.</font>

468
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,150
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

469
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,020
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're allowed to drop his name like that?</font>

470
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,450
<font color="yellow">I was hoping someone would remember him.</font>

471
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,890
<font color="yellow">It would be better if it were someone as brave as you.</font>

472
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,920
<font color="yellow">He was given a painkiller and a sedative,</font>

473
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,920
<font color="yellow">so he'll sleep for about five hours.</font>

474
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,250
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

475
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,920
<font color="yellow">In our country,</font>

476
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,320
<font color="yellow">you can't leave without a doctor's permission.</font>

477
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,820
<font color="yellow">Step aside.</font>

478
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,590
<font color="yellow">I have a mission to finish.</font>

479
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,720
<font color="yellow">I think I told you you'll be transferred in the morning.</font>

480
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,490
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to avoid...</font>

481
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,750
<font color="yellow">Commander Choe who is coming to get you?</font>

482
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,120
<font color="yellow">I thought about why you came looking for me.</font>

483
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,450
<font color="yellow">I'm your friend from far away,</font>

484
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:25,120
<font color="yellow">because your enemy...</font>

485
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,520
<font color="yellow">is also my enemy. Am I right?</font>

486
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,150
<font color="yellow">Did you betray your country...</font>

487
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
<font color="yellow">or...</font>

488
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:40,020
<font color="yellow">did your country betray you?</font>

489
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,520
<font color="yellow">A warrior...</font>

490
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,220
<font color="yellow">never betrays his country.</font>

491
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,920
<font color="yellow">Who survived?</font>

492
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,650
<font color="yellow">The North Star...</font>

493
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,090
<font color="yellow">or Pluto?</font>

494
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,620
<font color="yellow">Commander Choe?</font>

495
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:23,020
<font color="yellow">It's you, Pluto.</font>

496
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,850
<font color="yellow">I see why you're the instructor.</font>

497
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,520
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

498
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,320
<font color="yellow">the traitor?</font>

499
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,650
<font color="yellow">How could that be?</font>

500
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,950
<font color="yellow">The traitor...</font>

501
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,620
<font color="yellow">is you, Pluto.</font>

502
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,090
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

503
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,020
<font color="yellow">Help me escape.</font>

504
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,950
<font color="yellow">You'll die if you go back.</font>

505
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,020
<font color="yellow">Regardless of who betrayed whom.</font>

506
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,490
<font color="yellow">There is something I must finish.</font>

507
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,520
<font color="yellow">I said you'll die.</font>

508
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,750
<font color="yellow">Even if I do,</font>

509
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,890
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die on home soil.</font>

510
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,620
<font color="yellow">Please let me go.</font>

511
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,790
<font color="yellow">I'm also a soldier carrying out a mission for my country.</font>

512
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,920
<font color="yellow">I cannot let you get away.</font>

513
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,890
<font color="yellow">I have already repaid you for the naengmyeon...</font>

514
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,620
<font color="yellow">you bought for me at Pyeongyang in that firefight earlier.</font>

515
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:56,644
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU.</font>

516
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,150
<font color="yellow">This is my farewell gift to you.</font>

517
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,320
<font color="yellow">It's tasty,</font>

518
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,890
<font color="yellow">so I hope you savour it.</font>

519
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,290
<font color="yellow">Did you see your friend off?</font>

520
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,150
<font color="yellow">Your friend left the hospital without physician approval.</font>

521
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,690
<font color="yellow">Through that, I suppose.</font>

522
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,620
<font color="yellow">He's not close enough to bid goodbye.</font>

523
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,420
<font color="yellow">I feel the pain again.</font>

524
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
<font color="yellow">Sit up straight.</font>

525
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

526
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,750
<font color="yellow">Did you break that window yourself?</font>

527
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,650
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me.</font>

528
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,750
<font color="yellow">The fellow who left did it.</font>

529
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,190
<font color="yellow">Then did you break the window downstairs?</font>

530
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
<font color="yellow">That was also the other fellow's doing.</font>

531
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,450
<font color="yellow">Then I suppose that you, as friend of that fellow,</font>

532
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,990
<font color="yellow">will pay for the repair?</font>

533
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,350
<font color="yellow">As I told you before, We're not that close.</font>

534
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,190
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much the director scolded me for the windows?</font>

535
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,690
<font color="yellow">Where's the director now?</font>

536
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,450
<font color="yellow">He has no right to treat my girlfriend like that.</font>

537
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,820
<font color="yellow">My boyfriend was hospitalised with a North Korean soldier.</font>

538
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,550
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

539
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,620
<font color="yellow">I'll be back in two hours.</font>

540
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,020
<font color="yellow">Wait until your IV injection is complete and stay put.</font>

541
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,120
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare think of running away.</font>

542
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,250
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

543
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,920
<font color="yellow">Your antenatal education seems to be about anatomy.</font>

544
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:44,220
<font color="yellow">You said your baby is due in a week, right?</font>

545
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, next week.</font>

546
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,850
<font color="yellow">Did you see Doctor Kang's boyfriend? I heard that he's handsome.</font>

547
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,320
<font color="yellow">What's the use of being handsome...</font>

548
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,550
<font color="yellow">when he got hospitalised with a North Korean soldier?</font>

549
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,190
<font color="yellow">I heard that the North Korean soldier is also handsome.</font>

550
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,320
<font color="yellow">I hope reunification will happen soon.</font>

551
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,620
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

552
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,090
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you get changed?</font>

553
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,420
<font color="yellow">You obviously look pregnant in your scrub suit.</font>

554
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you'll worry your patients?</font>

555
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,450
<font color="yellow">Did your bad surgery skills get any better?</font>

556
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,020
<font color="yellow">You should always wear your doctors gown.</font>

557
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,590
<font color="yellow">Otherwise there'll be no way to tell if you're a patient or doctor.</font>

558
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,820
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

559
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,390
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

560
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,450
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

561
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,490
<font color="yellow">My water broke. I think it's about to come out.</font>

562
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,450
<font color="yellow">I thought you had a week left?</font>

563
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,720
<font color="yellow">Please call Doctor Jung at the maternity unit.</font>

564
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,020
<font color="yellow">- She's having a baby.
- Let go now.</font>

565
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,920
<font color="yellow">Squeeze harder.</font>

566
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,450
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

567
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,350
<font color="yellow">- I mean your hand.
- Take back what you said.</font>

568
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,620
<font color="yellow">Keep it up.</font>

569
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,520
<font color="yellow">- Hospital administration?
- Yes.</font>

570
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,890
<font color="yellow">I'm here regarding the cost of the broken windows.</font>

571
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,120
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're a guardian of Mr Yoo Si Jin.</font>

572
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,550
<font color="yellow">I don't think he's a man in need of a guardian.</font>

573
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,590
<font color="yellow">Two windows have been broken.</font>

574
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,150
<font color="yellow">The damage wasn't incurred by emergencies or natural disasters.</font>

575
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,150
<font color="yellow">Someone needs to pay the fine.</font>

576
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,990
<font color="yellow">I don't think that should be me.</font>

577
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,820
<font color="yellow">Director told me to bill it to you.</font>

578
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:15,020
<font color="yellow">I also think...</font>

579
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
<font color="yellow">that's the right thing to do.</font>

580
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,090
<font color="yellow">Clench your teeth shut.</font>

581
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,750
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you here?</font>

582
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,920
<font color="yellow">I'm the doctor in charge of the ward below the ward...</font>

583
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,860
<font color="yellow">that Yoo Si Jin broke.</font>

584
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,120
<font color="yellow">It wasn't Yoo Si Jin. It was the North Korean soldier who broke it.</font>

585
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,220
<font color="yellow">But the North Korean soldier went back to his country.</font>

586
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,290
<font color="yellow">So you should...</font>

587
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,550
<font color="yellow">You're showing teeth.</font>

588
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,450
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

589
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:38,890
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

590
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,620
<font color="yellow">The baby?</font>

591
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,820
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

592
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,520
<font color="yellow">- The baby is on the way?
- Okay.</font>

593
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,360
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving right now. I'll be off now.</font>

594
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,550
<font color="yellow">All right. Go. Be on your way.</font>

595
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,420
<font color="yellow">The baby is on the way. Isn't that great news?</font>

596
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,950
<font color="yellow">Doctor Kang. Doctor!</font>

597
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:56,490
<font color="yellow">South Koreans...</font>

598
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,120
<font color="yellow">drone on about separated families or economic cooperation.</font>

599
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,150
<font color="yellow">They think the future relies on peace negotiations.</font>

600
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,090
<font color="yellow">However, the higher the fences, the safer it is.</font>

601
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,690
<font color="yellow">It's better if the North and South are on distant terms.</font>

602
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,360
<font color="yellow">Wait outside.</font>

603
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,320
<font color="yellow">My thoughts...</font>

604
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,860
<font color="yellow">haven't been wrong.</font>

605
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,950
<font color="yellow">If you want to get what you want,</font>

606
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,020
<font color="yellow">threats are better than talking,</font>

607
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,790
<font color="yellow">and tension is better than peace.</font>

608
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,150
<font color="yellow">It's nice...</font>

609
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,150
<font color="yellow">to see you again.</font>

610
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,490
<font color="yellow">I will now debrief my mission.</font>

611
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,020
<font color="yellow">I have punished the 13th North Star...</font>

612
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,150
<font color="yellow">who tainted the honour of the nation.</font>

613
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,190
<font color="yellow">I've also identified the voice who made the order.</font>

614
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,020
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

615
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,990
<font color="yellow">I heard that you've also obtained the file of the transaction.</font>

616
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,620
<font color="yellow">Where's the file?</font>

617
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:21,520
<font color="yellow">Seeing that the South is quiet, they must have not broken the code yet.</font>

618
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,790
<font color="yellow">You must have it safely hidden in your body per your training.</font>

619
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,790

<font color="yellow">It would've been better if he was lying down in bed.</font>

772
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,720
<font color="yellow">He did lie down in bed instead of me a while ago, actually.</font>

773
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,790
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

774
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,450
<font color="yellow">Dae Yeong is very feminine.</font>

775
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,990
<font color="yellow">He even ran his fingers through his hair and...</font>

776
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,590
<font color="yellow">I was just joking.</font>

777
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,020
<font color="yellow">Right, he had this facial expression on, too.</font>

778
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,920
<font color="yellow">He said, "Oh, my" as he ran his fingers through his hair.</font>

779
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,320
<font color="yellow">I didn't say "Oh, my."</font>

780
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:14,850
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

781
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,650
<font color="yellow">You really are like "Dumb and Dumber".</font>

782
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,890
<font color="yellow">Rest well.</font>

783
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,190
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

784
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:26,150
<font color="yellow">I tried my best to get her to stay, okay?</font>

785
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,920
<font color="yellow">That's why I stopped you.</font>

786
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,790
<font color="yellow">I see. Is this a fight which can't be resolved like this?</font>

787
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,350
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

788
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,490
<font color="yellow">Why did you break up?</font>

789
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,620
<font color="yellow">I applied to get discharged.</font>

790
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,690
<font color="yellow">- What?
- That was the only choice...</font>

791
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,550
<font color="yellow">I could make.</font>

792
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,690
<font color="yellow">You did what?</font>

793
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:55,850
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

794
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,590
<font color="yellow">How could you make that decision by yourself?</font>

795
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,750
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed.</font>

796
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,550
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

797
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:09,450
<font color="yellow">Does Commander know?</font>

798
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,190
<font color="yellow">Myeong Ju was there when I went to see him.</font>

799
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,150
<font color="yellow">Go after her.</font>

800
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,290
<font color="yellow">You gave up your life for her.</font>

801
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,320
<font color="yellow">Don't make her wait too long.</font>

802
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,420
<font color="yellow">What do you think they're doing?</font>

803
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:25,150
<font color="yellow">In my opinion,</font>

804
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,150
<font color="yellow">they fought, and Myeong Ju probably broke up with him...</font>

805
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,250
<font color="yellow">for Dae Yeong's sake.</font>

806
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,390
<font color="yellow">That's why Myeong Ju can't give in.</font>

807
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,720
<font color="yellow">Because Myeong Ju is a good woman.</font>

808
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,350
<font color="yellow">In my opinion,</font>

809
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,350
<font color="yellow">Dae Yeong knows where Myeong Ju hid.</font>

810
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,190
<font color="yellow">He wants to go after her, but he can't do that.</font>

811
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,450
<font color="yellow">He wants to keep Myeong Ju's pride because she hid it so well.</font>

812
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,490
<font color="yellow">Because Dae Yeong is...</font>

813
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:04,150
<font color="yellow">a good man.</font>

814
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,750
<font color="yellow">What are you doing tonight?</font>

815
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,020
<font color="yellow">If you don't have anything special, come help me shop.</font>

816
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,490
<font color="yellow">What are you getting?</font>

817
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,190
<font color="yellow">Were you shopping for a car?</font>

818
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,090
<font color="yellow">I told you I was going to buy a new car when I returned to Korea.</font>

819
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,890
<font color="yellow">What's the point of saving up when you don't know when you'll die?</font>

820
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:19,020
<font color="yellow">I'll die after using all my money.</font>

821
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,220
<font color="yellow">I won't leave it for anyone. I'll use it all.</font>

822
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,950
<font color="yellow">What if you use it up and don't die?</font>

823
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,650
<font color="yellow">I haven't thought about that, but I will buy a new car.</font>

824
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,850
<font color="yellow">Choose one.</font>

825
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,790
<font color="yellow">What do you like?</font>

826
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,550
<font color="yellow">I like this one.</font>

827
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, you just interfered with my life.</font>

828
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,020
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that? Do you like me?</font>

829
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:40,620
<font color="yellow">The employee recommended this one, too.</font>

830
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:41,890
<font color="yellow">You were watching me.</font>

831
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:43,390
<font color="yellow">- Why? Do you like me?
- Yes.</font>

832
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,990
<font color="yellow">You said you like me. Why? Do you like...</font>

833
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,350
<font color="yellow">Wait, what?</font>

834
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,950
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

835
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,750
<font color="yellow">Buy it quickly. I'm hungry.</font>

836
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,550
<font color="yellow">Could you give me the contract? Quickly, please.</font>

853
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,390

858
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,090
<font color="yellow">I went to the rooftop to get some air.</font>

859

<font color="yellow">Were you at the department store again?</font>

862
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,690
<font color="yellow">Did you go with your friend?</font>

863
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,850

867
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:47,590
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

868
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,790
<font color="yellow">I've kept the peace,</font>

869
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,820

875
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,450
<font color="yellow">Will you be that uptight?</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm the patient, you know.</font>

877
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,020
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to do anything.</font>

878
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,850
<font color="yellow">The patient was well enough to visit the department store.</font>

00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,450
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

901
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,450
<font color="yellow">I saw the kind of peace you have kept...</font>

902

<font color="yellow">on the news.</font>

903
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:00,990
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

904
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,020
<font color="yellow">if you are really sorry,</font>

905
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,990
<font color="yellow">don't ever appear before me covered in blood.</font>

906
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:15,920
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

907
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,890
<font color="yellow">Copy that.</font>

908
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,120
<font color="yellow">Do you want to watch a movie? That movie we missed.</font>

909
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,020

<font color="yellow">My gosh, we finally get to watch this.</font>

913
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,450
<font color="yellow">This is something I couldn't even imagine.</font>

914
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,720
<font color="yellow">We finally get to play this.</font>

915
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,320
<font color="yellow">We stopped after making the payment last time.</font>

916

<font color="yellow">It was a long and a tough day,</font>

919
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,950
<font color="yellow">and I was in his arms.</font>

920
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:18,620
<font color="yellow">I shined brightly through the night in his arms...</font>

921
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,520
<font color="yellow">like a woman who was deeply loved.</font>

922
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,250
<font color="yellow">Did that movie we missed...</font>

923

<font color="yellow">have a happy ending...</font>

924
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,650
