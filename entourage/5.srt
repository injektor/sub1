00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,550
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go in
a nice suit like this.</font>

5
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,650
<font color="yellow">You've become a manager now.
We should celebrate.</font>

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,980
<font color="yellow">I signed the contract for
"War Terminator", too.</font>

7
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,880
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, congratulations on your promotion.</font>

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,480
<font color="yellow">Treat us sometime.</font>

9
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,780
<font color="yellow">You're a real manager now.</font>

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,250
<font color="yellow">Get me some jobs.</font>

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,810
<font color="yellow">I'm looking forward, too.</font>

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,850
<font color="yellow">The only change is the name of my position.</font>

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,710
<font color="yellow">It means Eun Gab recognized your ability.</font>

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,670
<font color="yellow">You worked so hard to get me the role.</font>

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,810
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. Mr. Kim doesn't mean it.</font>

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,230
<font color="yellow">He'll continue calling me Cup Noodles.
Just wait and see.</font>

17
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,310
<font color="yellow">This is how you should look in a suit.</font>

18
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,910
<font color="yellow">Look at me. Don't I look just amazing?</font>

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,680
<font color="yellow">Don't I look like an Italian?</font>

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,580
<font color="yellow">No, you look like a waiter.</font>

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,010
<font color="yellow">One steak, please.</font>

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,450
<font color="yellow">Look at yourself. With
such narrow shoulders,</font>

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,450
<font color="yellow">you look like a student
activist from the 70s.</font>

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,350
<font color="yellow">Your face looks like that of
an old man from the 19th century.</font>

25
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,310
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,880
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't get a new suit.</font>

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,780
<font color="yellow">Why would you need it when you have no job?</font>

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,050
<font color="yellow">Are you going to wear it
on your internet show?</font>

29
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,280
<font color="yellow">You're insulting a million
unemployed people out there.</font>

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,310
<font color="yellow">I really didn't want to bring this up.</font>

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,050
<font color="yellow">The "erection on the set" incident.</font>

32
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,650
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Stop it.</font>

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,370
<font color="yellow">It was a historical incident.</font>

34
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,280
<font color="yellow">It's so embarrassing that
it never even gets published.</font>

35
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,350
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,550
<font color="yellow">That never happened.</font>

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,520
<font color="yellow">He was supposed to act angry.</font>

38
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,650
<font color="yellow">But a certain body part got angry instead.</font>

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,810
<font color="yellow">It gets angry whenever he's angry.</font>

40
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,480
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, don't buy him a suit.</font>

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,050
<font color="yellow">- Why do you decide?
- I'm his cousin.</font>

42
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,550
<font color="yellow">That sounded so childish.</font>

43
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,350
<font color="yellow">Do you have a problem?</font>

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,280
<font color="yellow">You promised him to buy him
Michael Lau's artworks, right?</font>

45
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, Turtle loves them.</font>

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,210
<font color="yellow">You can't.</font>

47
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,180
<font color="yellow">If you buy him those,
I'll stop cooking for you guys.</font>

48
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,050
<font color="yellow">- You guys clean the house.
- Why?</font>

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,680
<font color="yellow">What should we do? He sounds serious.</font>

50
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,710
<font color="yellow">You're one petty waiter.</font>

51
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,150
<font color="yellow">When will my steak be served?</font>

52
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,350
<font color="yellow">Fine. Do you want to go
and have some steak?</font>

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,450
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

54
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,250
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,010
<font color="yellow">What's the point of getting a new suit?
I'm always at home.</font>

56
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,310
<font color="yellow">I know. You shouldn't
call yourself an actor.</font>

57
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,810
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

58
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,850
<font color="yellow">Look at that car.</font>

59
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,410
<font color="yellow">Who parks his car like this?</font>

60
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,610
<font color="yellow">We can still get out.</font>

61
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,450
<font color="yellow">Wait. We should teach this jerk a lesson.</font>

62
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,910
<font color="yellow">- What a jerk!
- Stop it.</font>

63
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,280
<font color="yellow">I'll call him.</font>

64
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,180
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- Let me do this.</font>

65
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,410
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

66
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,750
<font color="yellow">Let me call him instead.</font>

67
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,710
<font color="yellow">Get off me.</font>

68
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,650
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,710
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling me?</font>

70
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,410
<font color="yellow">Can you move your car?</font>

71
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,010
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

72
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,250
<font color="yellow">This car is yours.</font>

73
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,110
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

74
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,650
<font color="yellow">You're a success.</font>

75
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,250
<font color="yellow">You've come a long way.</font>

76
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,250
<font color="yellow">It's a present from me.</font>

77
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,650
<font color="yellow">Now that you're a manager,
you need a new car.</font>

78
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,110
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't deserve it.</font>

79
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,970
<font color="yellow">I already signed the contract.
Just take it.</font>

80
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
<font color="yellow">Pay me back when you become rich.</font>

81
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,880
<font color="yellow">Just take it.</font>

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,680
<font color="yellow">If you don't take it, I'll take it.</font>

83
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,810
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Wait.</font>

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,950
<font color="yellow">You're smiling ear to ear.</font>

85
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,350
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- You're almost bleeding.</font>

86
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,680
<font color="yellow">- I'll drive.
- Look at you.</font>

87
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,180
<font color="yellow">This car is so nice.</font>

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,150
<font color="yellow">Did Turtle get in the other
car because he's angry at me?</font>

89
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,080
<font color="yellow">He has a good reason.</font>

90
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,680
<font color="yellow">He'd been so excited about those artworks.</font>

91
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,580
<font color="yellow">I feel so great. That serves him right.</font>

92
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,850
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

93
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,280
<font color="yellow">Everyone knows Young Bin is your cousin.</font>

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,080
<font color="yellow">The caller ID is unknown?</font>

95
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,070
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you could still do this.</font>

96
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,280
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Is this Mr. Cha Joon?</font>

97
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,410
<font color="yellow">This is a film company.</font>

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,110
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is the one-of-a-kind actor,</font>

99
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,210
<font color="yellow">- Cha Joon.
- Gosh.</font>

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,050
<font color="yellow">I'm calling you regarding
our upcoming movie.</font>

101
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,950
<font color="yellow">Are you offering me an audition?</font>

102
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,350
<font color="yellow">I'm the assistant director.
I'd like to cast you without an audition.</font>

103
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,150
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

104
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,580
<font color="yellow">You are the assistant director.</font>

105
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,710
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's the movie about?</font>

106
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,550
<font color="yellow">It's an action movie.</font>

107
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,450
<font color="yellow">The shooting starts next month.</font>

108
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,610
<font color="yellow">An action movie?</font>

109
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,680
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

110
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,510
<font color="yellow">Could you tell me the title of it?</font>

111
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,150
<font color="yellow">It's called, "Angry Men".</font>

112
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,680
<font color="yellow">"Angry Men"?</font>

113
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,710
<font color="yellow">It sounds funny.</font>

114
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,750
<font color="yellow">The movie is about...</font>

115
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,050
<font color="yellow">a competition between angry men.</font>

116
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,610
<font color="yellow">Are you concerned about something?</font>

117
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,280
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

118
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,310
<font color="yellow">Which role will I be playing?</font>

119
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,880
<font color="yellow">The aroused man.</font>

120
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,210
<font color="yellow">The aroused man?</font>

121
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,250
<font color="yellow">It's an important role.</font>

122
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,810
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure I can do it well.</font>

124
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,780
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- The aroused man.</font>

125
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="yellow">It's an action movie.</font>

126
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,780
<font color="yellow">"Angry Men".</font>

127
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,050
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

128
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,650
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

129
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,350
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop him, I swear.</font>

130
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,080
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Go.</font>

131
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,150
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

132
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,810
<font color="yellow">Did we get too aggressive last time?</font>

133
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,610
<font color="yellow">I don't remember well.</font>

134
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,880
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't.</font>

135
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,880
<font color="yellow">I don't remember well, either,</font>

136
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,000
<font color="yellow">but if I had been really angry,
it wouldn't have stopped there.</font>

137
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,950
<font color="yellow">I wasn't serious, either.</font>

138
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,550
<font color="yellow">If you had crossed the line,
I would have made it clear.</font>

139
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,980
<font color="yellow">I know. We were quite cute.</font>

140
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
<font color="yellow">You were kinder than I had expected.</font>

141
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,550
<font color="yellow">What did you do to the
director, by the way?</font>

142
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,650
<font color="yellow">He really didn't like the idea at first.</font>

143
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,410
<font color="yellow">Did I miss anything?</font>

144
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,510
<font color="yellow">You're very skillful.</font>

145
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,850
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

146
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,250
<font color="yellow">He probably saw that I was genuine.</font>

147
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,950
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is a great actor.</font>

148
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,150
<font color="yellow">You wanted to make a contract with us,</font>

149
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,550
<font color="yellow">but you backed out when
the director objected.</font>

150
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,180
<font color="yellow">I'm very impressed.</font>

151
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,050
<font color="yellow">No production companies care
so much about directors' opinions.</font>

152
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,880
<font color="yellow">I'm done.</font>

153
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,250
<font color="yellow">The contract has been made.
I hope we'll stay on good terms.</font>

154
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,680
<font color="yellow">We should. We're on the same boat now.</font>

155
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,280
<font color="yellow">Who else will be in the movie?</font>

156
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,780
<font color="yellow">Who will play the supporting role?</font>

157
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,580
<font color="yellow">It's giving me a headache.</font>

158
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,750
<font color="yellow">We're talking with Kang
Ha Neul at the moment.</font>

159
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,910
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Kang Ha Neul?</font>

160
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,910
<font color="yellow">Is he good?</font>

161
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,450
<font color="yellow">Didn't Kang Ha Neul...</font>

162
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,410
<font color="yellow">have a scandal with An So Hee?</font>

163
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,810
<font color="yellow">There's something fishy.</font>

164
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,950
<font color="yellow">Why would he play a supporting role?</font>

165
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,380
<font color="yellow">- He's played main roles.
- I wonder that, too.</font>

166
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,210
<font color="yellow">The role is too small for him,
and he even had a scandal.</font>

167
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,380
<font color="yellow">Can you ask around?</font>

168
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,910
<font color="yellow">Sure, Mr. Lee. I'll ask around.</font>

169
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,110
<font color="yellow">You already have so much to care about.</font>

170
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,380
<font color="yellow">I heard you bought Ho Jin a car.</font>

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
<font color="yellow">He's a real manager now.</font>

172
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,750
<font color="yellow">His car was so old.</font>

173
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,880
<font color="yellow">He's too dorky to have such a fancy car.</font>

174
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,150
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- That's why he needs a nice car.</font>

175
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,210
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

176
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,250
<font color="yellow">Anyway, An So Hee signed the contract.</font>

177
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,650
<font color="yellow">The main actor and actress are decided now.</font>

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,350
<font color="yellow">Really? That's great.</font>

179
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,480
<font color="yellow">- You look so happy.
- Is there something going on?</font>

180
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,650
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- You brats.</font>

181
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,950
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

182
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,380
<font color="yellow">- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?</font>

183
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,680
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

184
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,780
<font color="yellow">Can't I get a role in "War Terminator"?</font>

185
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,950
<font color="yellow">Please ask them if there's a role for him.</font>

186
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,420
<font color="yellow">They hate it when a management company...</font>

187
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,680
<font color="yellow">tries to sell its actors in a bundle.</font>

188
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,610
<font color="yellow">I'll find you some auditions.</font>

189
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

190
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,710
<font color="yellow">Anyway, the contract has been signed.</font>

191
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,980
<font color="yellow">Now, focus on preparing for the shooting.</font>

192
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,810
<font color="yellow">- Help him.
- Okay.</font>

193
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,420
<font color="yellow">Stay red.</font>

194
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,980
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

195
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,780
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Your face.</font>

196
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,750
<font color="yellow">No surgery could save this.</font>

197
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
<font color="yellow">Take good care of it, okay?</font>

198
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,750
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Gosh. You should.</font>

199
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,110
<font color="yellow">I'll see you again.</font>

200
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,880
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is not in the position to
criticize someone else's looks.</font>

201
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,980
<font color="yellow">Right? That was...</font>

202
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,950
<font color="yellow">- Is he still angry?
- Joon!</font>

203
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,350
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

204
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,780
<font color="yellow"><i>(IT'S YOUNG BIN'S TREAT.)</i></font>

205
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,420
<font color="yellow">Aren't you coming with me?</font>

206
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,050
<font color="yellow">I'd be a third wheel. I'm not coming.</font>

207
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,180
<font color="yellow">I'm not coming, either.</font>

208
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,250
<font color="yellow">Couldn't you wait until
the shooting begins?</font>

209
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,960
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to let her
know the coffee is from me.</font>

210
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,250
<font color="yellow">Just admit you wanted to see So Hee.</font>

211
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,680
<font color="yellow">You're right. See you.</font>

212
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,980
<font color="yellow">He's wasting his time.</font>

213
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,050
<font color="yellow">Why is he so desperate?</font>

214
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,980
<font color="yellow">Should we go watch?</font>

215
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,710
<font color="yellow">We're not supposed to be here.</font>

216
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,220
<font color="yellow">I'm failing all the auditions, too.</font>

217
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,890
<font color="yellow">Then again, I guess you can't be on sets...</font>

218
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,080
<font color="yellow">after that incident.</font>

219
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,080
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin.</font>

220
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,720
<font color="yellow">Is there someone else than you here?</font>

221
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,780
<font color="yellow">- I'm hearing things.
- Gosh.</font>

222
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,110
<font color="yellow">Are you still angry?</font>

223
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,680
<font color="yellow">Why are you so petty?
You're almost 2m tall.</font>

224
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,810
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, tell him.</font>

225
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,380
<font color="yellow">I don't want to have
a conversation with a kid.</font>

226
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,920
<font color="yellow">I regret not following Young Bin.</font>

227
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,150
<font color="yellow">I apologize, Joon.</font>

228
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,950
<font color="yellow">I'll set you up with a girl.</font>

229
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,810
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

230
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,510
<font color="yellow">You've been avoiding girls because of...</font>

231
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,950
<font color="yellow">what the fortune teller said, right?</font>

232
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,450
<font color="yellow">I'll find you a girl.</font>

233
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,780
<font color="yellow">- You know what type I like, right?
- I do.</font>

234
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,210
<font color="yellow">It never changes.</font>

235
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,070
<font color="yellow">- Ho Jin, do you want one, too?
- Forget it.</font>

236
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,050
<font color="yellow">He has Ji An.</font>

237
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,050
<font color="yellow">- What are you saying?
- A lovesick man who always...</font>

238
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,310
<font color="yellow">watches a girl's back.</font>

239
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,780
<font color="yellow">That was nice. Say it once again.</font>

240
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,280
<font color="yellow">A lovesick man who always
watches a girl's back.</font>

241
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,910
<font color="yellow">That was so nice. Say it one more time.</font>

242
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,610
<font color="yellow">- It's nice, right? A lovesick...
- Stop it now.</font>

243
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you don't know when to stop.</font>

244
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,280
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

245
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,780
<font color="yellow"><i>(AN SO HEE)</i></font>

246
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,710
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

247
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,080
<font color="yellow">We're friends from school.
This is Young Bin.</font>

248
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,880
<font color="yellow">I know who he is. I love your movies.</font>

249
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,350
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- You're doing great.</font>

250
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,750
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you.
- Okay.</font>

251
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,250
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

252
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,560
<font color="yellow">It seems like I interrupted you.</font>

253
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,210
<font color="yellow">You didn't. Sit down.</font>

254
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,250
<font color="yellow">I wanted to see you
before we start shooting.</font>

255
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,710
<font color="yellow">- Maybe I came too early.
- It's okay.</font>

256
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,010
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the coffee.
Everyone looked so happy.</font>

257
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,350
<font color="yellow">You and Ha Neul...</font>

258
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,580
<font color="yellow">Should I call him Mr. Kang?</font>

259
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,110
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you two seem close.</font>

260
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
<font color="yellow">We are.</font>

261
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,010
<font color="yellow">We used to date.</font>

262
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,150
<font color="yellow">When you asked me,
we had already broken up.</font>

263
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,550
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you we were just friends.</font>

264
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,680
<font color="yellow">- I didn't mean to lie.
- It's okay.</font>

265
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,510
<font color="yellow">He came to see me recently.</font>

266
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,730
<font color="yellow">He wants to get back together with me.</font>

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,010
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

268
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,980
<font color="yellow">getting back together?</font>

269
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure yet.</font>

270
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,610
<font color="yellow">I don't want to think
about anything else...</font>

271
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,580
<font color="yellow">until this drama is over.</font>

272
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,050
<font color="yellow">I heard Ha Neul might
be in "War Terminator".</font>

273
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,250
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

274
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,610
<font color="yellow">I think it's because of me.</font>

275
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,210
<font color="yellow">It's to get back together with me.</font>

276
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,810
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth.</font>

277
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,510
<font color="yellow">Is it certain?</font>

278
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,750
<font color="yellow">Will Ha Neul take it? Why?</font>

279
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,280
<font color="yellow">How would I know? He
probably liked the script.</font>

280
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,780
<font color="yellow">Or the director.</font>

281
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
<font color="yellow">What is he thinking? What
did the director say?</font>

282
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,450
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me.</font>

283
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,950
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. You call me only when
you want something from me.</font>

284
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,550
<font color="yellow">Hey, I have tons of pictures
of your ex-girlfriend.</font>

285
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,050
<font color="yellow">I even have one where you kiss her.
Do you want it to spread?</font>

286
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,610
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

287
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,180
<font color="yellow">The director seems to be okay with it.</font>

288
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,580
<font color="yellow">That's all I know.</font>

289
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,010
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. Hang up.</font>

290
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,610
<font color="yellow">Why would you be busy?</font>

291
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,650
<font color="yellow">I'm the head of the team.</font>

292
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,650
<font color="yellow">Of course, you are.</font>

293
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,350
<font color="yellow">I'd like our investment
company to be more engaged.</font>

294
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,980
<font color="yellow">Are you going to let Ms. Jo run wild?</font>

295
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,380
<font color="yellow">The idea is almost like a co-investor.</font>

296
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,480
<font color="yellow">These days, management
companies have the most power.</font>

297
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,010
<font color="yellow">You're the boss.</font>

298
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,350
<font color="yellow">Cut it out.</font>

299
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,050
<font color="yellow">Why does everyone give me a
hard time if I'm one? Hang up.</font>

300
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,380
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- I started the meeting.</font>

301
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,850
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

302
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,750
<font color="yellow">I'm 4 minutes and 5 seconds
late, to be precise.</font>

303
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,380
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

304
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,980
<font color="yellow">I'm leading a meeting, don't you see?</font>

305
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,230
<font color="yellow">I'll attend meetings from now on.</font>

306
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,850
<font color="yellow">Stop interrupting the meeting.</font>

307
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,750
<font color="yellow">Sit over there.</font>

308
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,610
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

309
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,550
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

310
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,550
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

311
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

312
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,710
<font color="yellow">There's a rumor saying
that he slept with them.</font>

313
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,160
<font color="yellow">Is it a rumor or a fact?</font>

314
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,330
<font color="yellow">It seems like he did sleep
with a couple of them.</font>

315
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,090
<font color="yellow">It is exaggerated, though.</font>

316
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,260
<font color="yellow">It'll get published soon.</font>

317
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,380
<font color="yellow">Great job.</font>

318
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,420
<font color="yellow">Can't you do any better?</font>

319
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,920
<font color="yellow">Why do you blame me?</font>

320
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell him to be such a jerk.</font>

321
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,780
<font color="yellow">You're responsible for
managing your actors.</font>

322
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,950
<font color="yellow">You should have even used
violence to stop him.</font>

323
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:09,880
<font color="yellow">Who does that these days?</font>

324
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,420
<font color="yellow">These days, you can play go
or even sleep with a robot.</font>

325
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,480
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't beaten you up,
you would never have grown up.</font>

326
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,420
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate it.</font>

327
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,150
<font color="yellow">You totally sound like an old lady.</font>

328
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,050
<font color="yellow">And you're so young, right?</font>

329
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,920
<font color="yellow">Think about how you used to be.</font>

330
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,250
<font color="yellow">Are you ashamed of your past
now that you're a director?</font>

331
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,120
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

332
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,380
<font color="yellow">Have you checked if you have Alzheimer's?</font>

333
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,920
<font color="yellow">You're driving me crazy.</font>

334
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,780
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want to work.</font>

335
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,220
<font color="yellow">You said you were considering
taking a year off or retiring.</font>

336
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,220
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling greedy?</font>

337
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,280
<font color="yellow">Are you craving money?</font>

338
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,380
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

339
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,280
<font color="yellow">I dragged my old body here because
I couldn't stand your job.</font>

340
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
<font color="yellow">Do you get it now?</font>

341
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,880
<font color="yellow">Enjoy this.</font>

342
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,120
<font color="yellow">Did you see?</font>

343
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,850
<font color="yellow">She's crazy.</font>

344
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,120
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

345
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

346
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,300
<font color="yellow">You told me to water your plants.</font>

347
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,500
<font color="yellow">The meeting didn't take so long.</font>

348
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,020
<font color="yellow">How could we have a meeting
with a crazy woman?</font>

349
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,580
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Hey, be careful.</font>

350
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,480
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. I'll do it.</font>

351
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,820
<font color="yellow">I can't ask you to do anything.</font>

352
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,180
<font color="yellow">You're very nice to your plants.</font>

353
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,830
<font color="yellow">I wish you were that nice to me.</font>

354
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,350
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous?</font>

355
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,750
<font color="yellow">Say that to your boyfriend instead.</font>

356
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,980
<font color="yellow">Don't touch Young Bin.</font>

357
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,650
<font color="yellow">Young Bin?</font>

358
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,780
<font color="yellow">Move. Gosh.</font>

359
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,350
<font color="yellow">Young Bin?</font>

360
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,150
<font color="yellow">Don't touch it. This one is my treasure.</font>

361
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,880
<font color="yellow">Did you give your plants names?</font>

362
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

363
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,980
<font color="yellow">These are our most popular actors.</font>

364
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,880
<font color="yellow">What about the other actors?</font>

365
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,450
<font color="yellow">They don't have any plants.
They'll get one...</font>

366
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,050
<font color="yellow">when they become more popular.</font>

367
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,750
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

368
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,380
<font color="yellow">You're cute.</font>

369
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,950
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

370
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,980
<font color="yellow">It gave me goosebumps.</font>

371
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,820
<font color="yellow">Where? Down there?</font>

372
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,380
<font color="yellow">What kind of a girl says such a thing?</font>

373
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,020
<font color="yellow">You say it all the time.
Testicles, testicles,</font>

374
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,420
<font color="yellow">- testicles...
- Hey!</font>

375
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,980
<font color="yellow">Can't you stop saying that?</font>

376
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,350
<font color="yellow">At first, I didn't understand.</font>

377
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,850
<font color="yellow">I decide what I say.</font>

378
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,050
<font color="yellow">Get out. Stop talking.</font>

379
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:33,450
<font color="yellow">Don't tell anyone about my plants, okay?</font>

380
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,820
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll get a plant and name it Eun Gab.</font>

381
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,850
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

382
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

383
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,620
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim, I'm driving.
- Why is it so noisy?</font>

384
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,590
<font color="yellow">Are you still driving that junk?</font>

385
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

386
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,820
<font color="yellow">By the way, have you asked around?</font>

387
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

388
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,220
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

389
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

390
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,720
<font color="yellow">It seems like Ha Neul will do it.
The director likes him.</font>

391
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,050
<font color="yellow">Will you be acting with
So Hee's ex-boyfriend?</font>

392
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,750
<font color="yellow">It'll be so awkward.</font>

393
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,950
<font color="yellow">Is this a drama?</font>

394
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,820
<font color="yellow">It's terrible when your colleagues date.</font>

395
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,180
<font color="yellow">It's awkward when they fight.
This is not okay.</font>

396
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,250
<font color="yellow">Will you be all right?</font>

397
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,780
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

398
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,120
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the director and make a scene.</font>

399
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,150
<font color="yellow">That's a great idea. Should I make a turn?</font>

400
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
<font color="yellow">Should I?</font>

401
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,450
<font color="yellow">What can I do now?</font>

402
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,680
<font color="yellow">I have no choice.</font>

403
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,880
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about him.</font>

404
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,620
<font color="yellow">Are you finding me a girl or not?</font>

405
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,590
<font color="yellow">I showed pictures of you to girls,</font>

406
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,820
<font color="yellow">and everyone said no.</font>

407
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,480
<font color="yellow">They said you were ugly and old.</font>

408
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,320
<font color="yellow">One girl genuinely got angry with me.</font>

409
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,380
<font color="yellow">- I fought for you.
- Gosh.</font>

410
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,880
<font color="yellow">Likes attract likes.</font>

411
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:51,320
<font color="yellow">Everyone around you is weird.</font>

412
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,960
<font color="yellow">I know I don't usually
look good on pictures.</font>

413
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,280
<font color="yellow">You look much better on pictures.</font>

414
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,850
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

415
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,520
<font color="yellow">Keep your promise.</font>

416
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,150
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll get really angry.</font>

417
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,020
<font color="yellow">When are we going to stop?
Joon is driving me crazy.</font>

418
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,680
<font color="yellow">Why did you tag along in the first place?</font>

419
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,450
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to drive
it for the last time.</font>

420
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,120
<font color="yellow">We all feel attached to this car.</font>

421
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,350
<font color="yellow">Joon and I used to go
to auditions with this car.</font>

422
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,180

- What happened?</font>

425
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,020
<font color="yellow">Did you get hurt that seriously?</font>

426
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,480
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so dusty.</font>

427
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,220
<font color="yellow">What? Does it feel like you're
saying goodbye to a girl?</font>

428
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,980
<font color="yellow">Kind of.</font>

429
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,180
<font color="yellow">I know that feeling.</font>

430
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,360
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

431
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,820
<font color="yellow">He does know that feeling.</font>

432
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,320
<font color="yellow">He's seen so many girls walk away from him.</font>

433
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,450
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

434
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,920
<font color="yellow">My phone is ringing.</font>

435
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:08,380

<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be on my way.</font>

439
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,560

445
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
<font color="yellow">It's a lingerie fashion show.</font>

<font color="yellow">Good thing I decided to follow you.</font>

447

<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

449
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,390

451

<font color="yellow">What type of a woman is she?</font>

452
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,570
<font color="yellow">She's the marketing manager
of this lingerie brand.</font>

453

<font color="yellow">She's nice and pretty. Follow me.</font>

454
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,230
<font color="yellow">She must've hurt her head for
wanting to go on a date...</font>

<font color="yellow">with Joon judging by his picture.</font>

456
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:15,860
<font color="yellow">She must be into tall and bald guys.</font>

457
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,330
<font color="yellow">- Am I right?
- Sure.</font>

00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,860
<font color="yellow">Do something about him.</font>

460
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,990
<font color="yellow">Do what exactly?</font>

461
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

462
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,690
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

463
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,590
<font color="yellow">you do marketing.</font>

464
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,360
<font color="yellow">I do. Are you enjoying the show?</font>

465
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,890
<font color="yellow">I love it.</font>

466
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,230
<font color="yellow">I've never been to something
like this before.</font>

467
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,530
<font color="yellow">Do you really not have a boyfriend?</font>

468
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,600
<font color="yellow">You look like you'd be popular among men.</font>

469
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,560
<font color="yellow">- I'm busy with work.
- I see.</font>

470
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,490
<font color="yellow">By the way, you don't look
like Cha Young Bin at all.</font>

471
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,490
<font color="yellow">- I heard you guys are cousins.
- Well...</font>

472
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,060
<font color="yellow">We looked alike when we were kids.</font>

473
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,660
<font color="yellow">As we grew up,</font>

474
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,730
<font color="yellow">I turned more masculine.</font>

475
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,960
<font color="yellow">My physique...</font>

476
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,860
<font color="yellow">and everywhere else.</font>

477
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,690
<font color="yellow">Are your friends still here?</font>

478
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,230
<font color="yellow">Including Young Bin?</font>

479
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:25,790
<font color="yellow">Yes. They should be downstairs.</font>

480
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,410
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to send them away?</font>

481
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,990
<font color="yellow">No. They should stay.</font>

482
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,490
<font color="yellow">Everyone's excited with
Young Bin being here.</font>

483
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,600
<font color="yellow">Young Bin was the only person
on her mind in the first place.</font>

484
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,290
<font color="yellow">She went on a date with me
so Young Bin would come to the show.</font>

485
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,490
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that.</font>

486
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,090
<font color="yellow">Even Eun thought she was into you.</font>

487
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,030
<font color="yellow">I was a gentleman to her
even when I found out.</font>

488
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,060
<font color="yellow">Are you that into her?</font>

489
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,090
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to cut you up?</font>

490
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,830
<font color="yellow">- There's a last resort.
- What?</font>

491
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,730
<font color="yellow">We should update your profile on 2km
saying you're the actor Cha Joon.</font>

492
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,190
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

493
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,160
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong about dating apps?</font>

494
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,360
<font color="yellow">It's just an innocent social meet
up between a man and a woman.</font>

495
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,650
<font color="yellow">Do you think women will like him?</font>

496
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,790
<font color="yellow">He'll get a few calls from
the fans of Sugar Boys.</font>

497
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,130
<font color="yellow">- You think so?
- What are you so happy about?</font>

498
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,530
<font color="yellow">I said I'm against it.</font>

499
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,330
<font color="yellow">It's not my fault when
the agency finds out.</font>

500
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,690
<font color="yellow">Look how he's changed after the promotion.</font>

501
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,270
<font color="yellow">He's the source of all evil.
He's the second Kim Eun Gab.</font>

502
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,090
<font color="yellow">I'm not taking any part in this.</font>

503
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,370
<font color="yellow">You're going to an exhibition tomorrow.</font>

504
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,730
<font color="yellow">- Jung Woo's painting exhibition?
- Yes.</font>

505
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,590
<font color="yellow">I think So Hee will be there, too.</font>

506
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,260
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

507
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,520
<font color="yellow">What's that reaction?
I thought you'd be happier.</font>

508
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,330
<font color="yellow">I am happy.</font>

509
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,430
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

510
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,430
<font color="yellow">That's it?</font>

511
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,160
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Aren't you eating?</font>

512
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,430
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bed.</font>

513
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,730
<font color="yellow">There he goes again with
the An So Hee virus.</font>

514
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,410
<font color="yellow">He always gets depressed
when he gets infected.</font>

515
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,560
<font color="yellow">I hope it's not contagious.</font>

516
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,390
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

517
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,360
<font color="yellow">You're the one who scared me.</font>

518
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,360
<font color="yellow">It's late night.
I thought you were a mugger.</font>

519
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,230
<font color="yellow">Why would you be walking around
at night if you're so scared?</font>

520
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,860
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

521
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,190
<font color="yellow">- How did you know I was here?
- Isn't it obvious?</font>

522
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,360
<font color="yellow">You always sneak out at night
when you have a headache.</font>

523
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,090
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

524
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,960
<font color="yellow">I have a bad headache.</font>

525
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,650
<font color="yellow">We should say we don't
want to work with Ha Neul.</font>

526
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,190
<font color="yellow">- To whom?
- To Mr. Kim.</font>

527
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,830
<font color="yellow">Or even the director or So Hee.</font>

528
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,130
<font color="yellow">- I don't like the idea.
- Sure, you don't.</font>

529
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,830
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't be able to stay in the
same room with my girl's ex.</font>

530
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,090
<font color="yellow">Let alone for a few months.</font>

531
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,130
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

532
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,390
<font color="yellow">That'll be so frustrating.</font>

533
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,730
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. He only wants to
do the movie because of So Hee.</font>

534
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,090
<font color="yellow">He's not normal.</font>

535
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,930
<font color="yellow">I wanted to do the movie
for the same reason.</font>

536
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,160
<font color="yellow">You're not normal either.</font>

537
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,230
<font color="yellow">Why are actors so abnormal?</font>

538
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,190
<font color="yellow">Why would they pick love over work?</font>

539
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,560
<font color="yellow">My disappointment grows bigger
everyday I work as a manager.</font>

540
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,840
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing at me?
Do you think this is funny?</font>

541
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,890
<font color="yellow">Should I cry, then?</font>

542
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,890
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine.</font>

543
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,130
<font color="yellow">I looked at the scripts and
I won't be working with him that much.</font>

544
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
<font color="yellow">I'll just have to deal with it.</font>

545
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,790
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- No,</font>

546
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,690
<font color="yellow">but I still have to make an effort.</font>

547
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm dating
So Hee at the moment.</font>

548
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,990
<font color="yellow">Whether they start seeing
each other again or not,</font>

549
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,960
<font color="yellow">it's none of my business.</font>

550
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,560
<font color="yellow">That's awfully professional of you.</font>

551
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,430
<font color="yellow">You should try it sometimes.</font>

552
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,860
<font color="yellow">I'm always professional.</font>

553
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,990
<font color="yellow"><i>(HA JUNG WOO PRIVATE EXHIBITION)</i></font>

554
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,790
<font color="yellow">Young Jun.</font>

555
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,730
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Young Bin.</font>

556
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,730
<font color="yellow">- Are you here for the exhibition?
- Yes.</font>

557
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,460
<font color="yellow">I've seen it already, but
I'm not so sure about it.</font>

558
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,190
<font color="yellow">I'll see you later.</font>

559
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,790
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

560
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,960
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Kang Ha Neul next to So Hee?</font>

561
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,590
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

562
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,530
<font color="yellow">- Let's go home.
- What?</font>

563
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

564
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,860
<font color="yellow">The pleasure is ours.</font>

565
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,490
<font color="yellow">I think Yoo Bin really wants to...</font>

566
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,360
<font color="yellow">improve and be better.</font>

567
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,660
<font color="yellow">What did you think?</font>

568
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,630
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but you'll have
to excuse me for a moment.</font>

569
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,030
<font color="yellow">- I'm really sorry.
- Excuse me.</font>

570
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,660
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

571
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,560
<font color="yellow">Can you talk right now, Mr. Kim?</font>

572
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,660
<font color="yellow">Make it short.</font>

573
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,430
<font color="yellow">About Kang Ha Neul.</font>

574
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,830
<font color="yellow">Is it confirmed that he'll
be on "War Terminator"?</font>

575
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,190
<font color="yellow">That's what's bothering me too.</font>

576
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,560
<font color="yellow">It's not confirmed yet.</font>

577
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,390
<font color="yellow">Why? Is Young Bin against it?</font>

578
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,760
<font color="yellow">He's not exactly the problem,</font>

579
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,260
<font color="yellow">but So Hee is.</font>

580
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,830
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

581
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,110
<font color="yellow">The reason why Ha Neul wants
to do "War Terminator" is...</font>

582
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,230
<font color="yellow">because of So Hee.</font>

583
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,530
<font color="yellow">It looks like they're
still seeing each other.</font>

584
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,390
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

585
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,730
<font color="yellow">Since when did hooking up become
the purpose of doing movies?</font>

586
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,590
<font color="yellow">When actors start having intimate
relationships with each other,</font>

587
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,860
<font color="yellow">the same thing goes for staff
member on staff member...</font>

588
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,490
<font color="yellow">and actor on staff member,</font>

589
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,360
<font color="yellow">it'll most certainly ruin
the working environment.</font>

590
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,730
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, Young Bin has a crush on So Hee.</font>

591
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,790
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

592
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,260
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Did you say he likes So Hee?</font>

593
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,110
<font color="yellow">Aren't they just college friends?</font>

594
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,160
<font color="yellow">Young Bin likes So Hee.</font>

595
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,160
<font color="yellow">I'm worried about the
movie because of that.</font>

596
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,230
<font color="yellow">You should've told me earlier.</font>

597
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,490
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing it to me now?</font>

598
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,730
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't have let him work with her.</font>

599
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,510
<font color="yellow">Is shooting a movie some third-rate drama?</font>

600
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,190
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to hook them up?</font>

601
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,360
<font color="yellow">Do you think a movie set is
some college frat party?</font>

602
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,490
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

603
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, my head.</font>

604
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,930
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

605
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,460
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

606
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,530
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

607
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,190
<font color="yellow">When did you get here?</font>

608
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,430
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this?</font>

609
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,670
<font color="yellow">I had a horrible experience from
a dating site 10 years ago.</font>

610
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,470
<font color="yellow">I think I heard this story before.
Did you not like her?</font>

611
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,810
<font color="yellow">Surprisingly, she was very hot
like she described herself.</font>

612
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,360
<font color="yellow">But she was too open-minded. She
asked me to buy her drinks...</font>

613
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,290
<font color="yellow">and came on to me like crazy.
I got scared and ran away.</font>

614
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,590
<font color="yellow">Oh, the good old days.</font>

615
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,090
<font color="yellow">Why would you run away, though?</font>

616
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,140
<font color="yellow">You saw the picture I sent you, right?</font>

617
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,760
<font color="yellow">- She's hot.
- I'm not running away this time.</font>

618
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,290
<font color="yellow">I'm open-minded now.</font>

619
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,630
<font color="yellow">Are you sure the picture
wasn't photo-shopped?</font>

620
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,560
<font color="yellow">Was the picture taken by her phone?</font>

621
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,630
<font color="yellow">Stop with the whining already.</font>

622
00:30:50,654 --> 00:31:02,654
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

623
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,430
<font color="yellow">I watched all of your videos
back when you were an idol.</font>

624
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,030
<font color="yellow">I even watched your movies.</font>

625
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,290
<font color="yellow">You did?</font>

626
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,660
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

627
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,790
<font color="yellow">you look much better in person.</font>

628
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:18,060
<font color="yellow">You flatter me.</font>

629
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,990
<font color="yellow">I get that a lot.</font>

630
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,030
<font color="yellow">You do, right?</font>

631
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,530
<font color="yellow">It's really strange.</font>

632
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,130
<font color="yellow">I'm so used to seeing you from videos.</font>

633
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,030
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

634
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,290
<font color="yellow">you're a really special person.</font>

635
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,360
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

636
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,860
<font color="yellow">I'm nothing special really.</font>

637
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,590
<font color="yellow">You must be close with many famous actors.</font>

638
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,930
<font color="yellow">Who are you friends with?</font>

639
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,960
<font color="yellow">I have friends here and there.</font>

640
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,330
<font color="yellow">Why is he calling me?</font>

641
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,190
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Is it a celebrity?</font>

642
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,930
<font color="yellow">It's someone called Kim Ki Bang.
He does a little acting.</font>

643
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,730
<font color="yellow">Can you excuse me for a second?</font>

644
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,760
<font color="yellow">Hi. What is it?</font>

645
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,460
<font color="yellow">You want to play pools
with someone like me?</font>

646
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,160
<font color="yellow">I thought you were busy spending
time with star celebrities.</font>

647
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,730
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, too. I'm with someone right now.</font>

648
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,960
<font color="yellow">You can come if you want.
Turtle's here, too.</font>

649
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,500
<font color="yellow">You know the place where
Lee Eun works, right?</font>

650
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,790
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

651
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,930
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang's coming.</font>

652
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,760
<font color="yellow">Why did you invite him?
You're in the middle of a date.</font>

653
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,190
<font color="yellow">I want to show off my connections.</font>

654
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,530
<font color="yellow">Maybe I shouldn't have invited him.</font>

655
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,890
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang is all right.</font>

656
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,440
<font color="yellow">It's not like he's on
the same level as Young Bin.</font>

657
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,330
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

658
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,560
<font color="yellow">He'll make me look good.</font>

659
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,890
<font color="yellow">You two aren't any different.</font>

660
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,730
<font color="yellow">The only difference is that you're taller.</font>

661
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,230
<font color="yellow">No way. He does make him look good.</font>

662
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,390
<font color="yellow">By 0.01mm.</font>

663
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,470
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
I was born with better genes.</font>

664
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,090
<font color="yellow">He looks like a descendant of barbarians.</font>

665
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,360
<font color="yellow">I'm Young Bin's cousin.</font>

666
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,690
<font color="yellow">Did your standards become too high
from being around with Young Bin?</font>

667
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,260
<font color="yellow">You're delusional.</font>

668
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,160
<font color="yellow">How's the date going anyway?</font>

669
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,460
<font color="yellow">I think she's really into me.</font>

670
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,730
<font color="yellow">It's a bit overwhelming.</font>

671
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,760
<font color="yellow">She's gone crazy.</font>

672
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,260
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's just you.</font>

673
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,360
<font color="yellow">Everyone's gone crazy.</font>

674
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,160
<font color="yellow">I'm such a big fan.</font>

675
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:32,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

676
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,060
<font color="yellow">You look so much better in person.</font>

677
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,990
<font color="yellow">You look so tough and manly.</font>

678
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,760
<font color="yellow">- You're even sexy.
- What?</font>

679
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,360
<font color="yellow">Did you say I'm sexy?</font>

680
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,490
<font color="yellow">I do get that a lot these days.</font>

681
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,660
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang.</font>

682
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,830
<font color="yellow">Turtle's waiting for you.</font>

683
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,330
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. Turtle.</font>

684
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,460
<font color="yellow">You should hang out with us.</font>

685
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,030
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

686
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:05,490
<font color="yellow">Did I make you uncomfortable?</font>

687
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,290
<font color="yellow">It's nothing like that.</font>

688
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,060
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'll stick around for a while.</font>

689
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,990
<font color="yellow">- Is that okay?
- What?</font>

690
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,430
<font color="yellow">Of course. You can stay for a minute.</font>

691
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

692
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,630
<font color="yellow">Do you work out?</font>

693
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,990
<font color="yellow">Your biceps are so big.</font>

694
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,790
<font color="yellow">I did some working out for my role.
Can you tell?</font>

695
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,960
<font color="yellow">What about the chest?</font>

696
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,030
<font color="yellow">Can I feel your chest a little?</font>

697
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,590
<font color="yellow">My chest? Hold on.</font>

698
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,460
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

699
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,330
<font color="yellow">How can she pick Ki Bang over you?</font>

700
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,230
<font color="yellow">You got manhandled by a barbarian.</font>

701
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,330
<font color="yellow">Is it because he's well known?</font>

702
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:11,260
<font color="yellow">You have to tell Ki Bang to go home.</font>

703
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,530
<font color="yellow">I told you she's crazy.</font>

704
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,630
<font color="yellow">She's just happy to see celebrities.</font>

705
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,960
<font color="yellow">Even so.</font>

706
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,760
<font color="yellow">Why does he have to ruin my date?</font>

707
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:23,060
<font color="yellow">He was never the popular one among women.</font>

708
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,900
<font color="yellow">She said he's sexy.</font>

709
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,790
<font color="yellow">Stop whining and go back.</font>

710
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,790
<font color="yellow">You're going to scare off my customers.</font>

711
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,360
<font color="yellow">She's right. You can't just leave them be.</font>

712
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,530
<font color="yellow">I don't care any more.
They're crazy about each other.</font>

713
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,660
<font color="yellow">They've got their hands
all over each other.</font>

714
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,580
<font color="yellow">They shouldn't be doing that here.</font>

715
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,140
<font color="yellow">- No way.
- Hurry.</font>

716
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,160
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

717
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,130
<font color="yellow">Something came up.</font>

718
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,730
<font color="yellow">I have to go now.</font>

719
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:04,030
<font color="yellow">- Me, too.
- I'm sorry.</font>

720
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,290
<font color="yellow">Did they do it?</font>

721
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,340
<font color="yellow">That scum.</font>

722
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
<font color="yellow">Did you see it?</font>

723
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,710
<font color="yellow">Can you talk to me?</font>

724
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

725
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,190
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to talk?</font>

726
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,410
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you anything.
You'll just slip it right out.</font>

727
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,910
<font color="yellow">I told you. There was no other way.</font>

728
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,940
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

729
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,870
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to tell him I like So Hee?</font>

730
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,140
<font color="yellow">How are you planning on shooting
the film with those two?</font>

731
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,710
<font color="yellow">You didn't even say hello to Jung Woo.</font>

732
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,140
<font color="yellow">I was surprised.</font>

733
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,440
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

734
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,380
<font color="yellow">It's my problem. I'll
take care of it myself.</font>

735
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,710
<font color="yellow">This isn't just your problem.
The whole movie is at stake.</font>

736
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,110
<font color="yellow">This is everyone's problem.
That's why I told Mr. Kim.</font>

737
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,980
<font color="yellow">You're completely on
his side now, aren't you?</font>

738
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,120
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you can solve
this problem on your own?</font>

739
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,270
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

740
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,010
<font color="yellow">Even I can't do anything about it.</font>

741
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,540
<font color="yellow">I talked to Mr. Kim just now.
He'll take care of it.</font>

742
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,270
<font color="yellow">That was quick.</font>

743
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,540
<font color="yellow">You two are basically partners now.</font>

744
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
<font color="yellow">What a perfect agency.</font>

745
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
<font color="yellow">I did this for you as a manager.</font>

746
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,490
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have, as my friend.</font>

747
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,080
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to be a good
manger or a good friend?</font>

748
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,080
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

749
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,470
<font color="yellow">You really have to pick your side.</font>

750
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,970
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

751
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,010
<font color="yellow">Either love or work. Pick
one and stick with it.</font>

752
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
<font color="yellow">When did you become so...</font>

753
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,340
<font color="yellow">Did you learn that one from Eun Gab?</font>

754
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,870
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes.</font>

755
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,910
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if
I babbled about you and Ji An?</font>

756
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,170
<font color="yellow">She's still here.</font>

757
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,740
<font color="yellow">- Am I interrupting?
- No.</font>

758
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,710
<font color="yellow">I'm done for today. I'll
come back tomorrow.</font>

759
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,080
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- I need to talk to you, Ji An.</font>

760
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,170
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin says...</font>

761
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,080
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Goodbye.</font>

762
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,970
<font color="yellow">He wants to have dinner with you.
Isn't that right, Ho Jin?</font>

763
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,870
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I can't tonight.</font>

764
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,940
<font color="yellow">By the way, my mom wants to have
dinner with you, Young Bin.</font>

765
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,670
<font color="yellow">You can refuse if you don't want to.</font>

766
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,440
<font color="yellow">Not at all. You'll be there, right?</font>

767
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

768
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,740
<font color="yellow">You have to be there.</font>

769
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,240
<font color="yellow">You'd like it, too, right?</font>

770
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

771
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,040
<font color="yellow">So be it, then.</font>

772
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,670
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

773
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,410
<font color="yellow">What is it? Did it not go well?</font>

774
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,140
<font color="yellow">Why won't you tell us?</font>

775
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,740
<font color="yellow">Whatever.</font>

776
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,470
<font color="yellow">Tell them.</font>

777
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,270
<font color="yellow">Don't get me started.</font>

778
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,720
<font color="yellow">Ki Bang stole her away from him.</font>

779
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,310
<font color="yellow">His date went to Ki Bang instead.</font>

780
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,670
<font color="yellow">Why did you tell them?
You're such a big mouth.</font>

781
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,170
<font color="yellow">Hear that?</font>

782
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,080
<font color="yellow">He called you a big mouth.</font>

783
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,510
<font color="yellow">Stop it. When will you ever grow up?</font>

784
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
<font color="yellow">Did something go wrong?</font>

785
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,440
<font color="yellow">Turtle's asking.</font>

786
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,390
<font color="yellow">Why don't you tell him with your big mouth?</font>

787
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,210
<font color="yellow">When Young Bin saw...</font>

788
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,440
<font color="yellow">So Hee and Ha Neul together
at the exhibition,</font>

789
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,210
<font color="yellow">he ran away.</font>

790
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,580
<font color="yellow">Is today Cha family's humiliation day?</font>

791
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,710
<font color="yellow">What happened next?</font>

792
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,310
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin called Eun Gab right away.</font>

793
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,610
<font color="yellow">Telling him that I like So Hee.</font>

794
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,140
<font color="yellow">He did that?</font>

795
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:58,740
<font color="yellow">Is that funny to you?</font>

796
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,140
<font color="yellow">- Ho Jin did the right thing.
- How?</font>

797
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,410
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

798
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,010
<font color="yellow">You're right. I'm a coward
and a small-minded person.</font>

799
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,110
<font color="yellow">So you do know. That's your strong forte.</font>

800
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,580
<font color="yellow">I should tell on you, too.</font>

801
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,710
<font color="yellow">To Mr. Kim?</font>

802
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,840
<font color="yellow">No, to Ms. Kang.</font>

803
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,440
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is in love with
your daughter, Ms. Kang.</font>

804
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,210
<font color="yellow">- That's hilarious.
- I know, right?</font>

805
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,670
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have dinner with
Ms. Kang. Do you want to join?</font>

806
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,510
<font color="yellow">You could get to know each other.</font>

807
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,310
<font color="yellow">I don't feel comfortable around her.</font>

808
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,850
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about me, anyway?</font>

809
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,610
<font color="yellow">I was hoping it didn't
have to come down to this.</font>

810
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,240
<font color="yellow">Let's go Feeling Camping.</font>

811
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,080
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

812
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,370
<font color="yellow">This will get the job done.</font>

813
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,910
<font color="yellow">People start dating from this.</font>

814
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,470
<font color="yellow">Are you really going camping
instead of seeing Ms. Kang?</font>

815
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,370
<font color="yellow">I choose love over work.
Let's go right now.</font>

816
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,510
<font color="yellow">And stop fighting, you two.
You can't even date girls.</font>

817
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,940
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

818
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,470
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

819
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,510
<font color="yellow">Leave them be. They're all the same.</font>

820
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,670
<font color="yellow">They're losers, loners
and cowards acting tough.</font>

821
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,810
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

822
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,740
<font color="yellow">This is Feeling Camping?</font>

823
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
<font color="yellow">Look at the pictures.</font>

824
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,710
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

825
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,580
<font color="yellow">You're so much work.</font>

826
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,370
<font color="yellow">Sit down and relax.</font>

827
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:35,394
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

828
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,970
<font color="yellow">Bravo.</font>

829
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,640
<font color="yellow">This is exciting.</font>

830
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,080
<font color="yellow">Do we set up our tent here?</font>

831
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,240
<font color="yellow">No. We have to go up higher in
the mountains where it's not so crowded.</font>

832
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,160
<font color="yellow">We'll be alone with the girls in the woods.</font>

833
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:47,950
<font color="yellow">That's what Feeling Camping is all about.</font>

834
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,010
<font color="yellow">Do we have to carry all this?</font>

835
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,970
<font color="yellow">Did you forget why we're here?</font>

836
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,870
<font color="yellow">- You're welcome to go back home.
- Okay, fine.</font>

837
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,890
<font color="yellow">Are you sure about this, though?</font>

838
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,670
<font color="yellow">100 percent. They get all romantic here.</font>

839
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,920
<font color="yellow">Sitting around the bonfire
and staring into each other.</font>

840
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,540
<font color="yellow">That's where it all starts.</font>

841
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,010
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have a girlfriend again?</font>

842
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,850
<font color="yellow">- It's a mystery.
- It's because you're jobless.</font>

843
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,540
<font color="yellow">That's right. We have that in common.</font>

844
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,610
<font color="yellow">I'm not jobless. I'm an actor.</font>

845
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,010
<font color="yellow">You are jobless. And I'm the better one.</font>

846
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

847
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,280
<font color="yellow">I'm just jobless, but you're
ugly, old and jobless.</font>

848
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,790
<font color="yellow">You look like one of the salamanders
that live in the mountains.</font>

849
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,990
<font color="yellow">You'll be thanking me by
the time we're heading back home.</font>

850
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,740
<font color="yellow">You'll be calling me "Sir". Call me "Sir".</font>

851
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,370
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- Good boy.</font>

852
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:32,410
<font color="yellow">Bring them out.</font>

853
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,910
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

854
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,570
<font color="yellow">This is crazy.</font>

855
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,410
<font color="yellow">Am I supposed to carry all of them?</font>

856
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,670
<font color="yellow">I never knew there was a
place like this in Korea.</font>

857
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,310
<font color="yellow">I've never seen anything like that.</font>

858
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,770
<font color="yellow">What happened here?</font>

859
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,270
<font color="yellow">I'm a nature man.</font>

860
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,510
<font color="yellow">The aroused man.</font>

861
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:58,640
<font color="yellow">How much longer do we have to go?</font>

862
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,790
<font color="yellow">I didn't come here to climb.</font>

863
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,940
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

864
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,090
<font color="yellow">This place looks good enough.
Do you want to set up camp here?</font>

865
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

866
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,370
<font color="yellow">Joon. Set up the camp already.</font>

867
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,270
<font color="yellow">- I need to rest for a bit.
- No.</font>

868
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,710
<font color="yellow">It'll get dark soon. The women
won't come up here then.</font>

869
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,240
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

870
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:31,970
<font color="yellow">Let's get working.</font>

871
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,540
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

872
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,410
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I'm doing all the work.</font>

873
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,870
<font color="yellow">You're such a whiner.</font>

874
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,310
<font color="yellow">I'm doing the most important job.</font>

875
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,440
<font color="yellow">I'm uploading pictures on
my social media accounts.</font>

876
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,970
<font color="yellow">Take a look. See?</font>

877
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:02,070
<font color="yellow">Do you see what's happening as we speak?</font>

878
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,710
<font color="yellow">- See what?
- Don't you see it?</font>

879
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,110
<font color="yellow">"Where are you?", "Where is that?",
"Where are you right now?"</font>

880
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,790
<font color="yellow">"I'll be there soon",
"I'm taking the cab there."</font>

881
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,910
<font color="yellow">- 10 comments already.
- Tell them to get over here quick.</font>

882
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,790
<font color="yellow">- I told you I'd do you good.
- You were right.</font>

883
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,410
<font color="yellow">Don't call too many people over.</font>

884
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,940
<font color="yellow">We only have four chairs.</font>

885
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,240
<font color="yellow">We should get 400 to 500 people over.</font>

886
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,040
<font color="yellow">200 will be swimming over there
and the other 200 will be over there.</font>

887
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,210
<font color="yellow">The rest 100 will be holding
candles by the fire...</font>

888
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,770
<font color="yellow">crying, telling stories and all that.</font>

889
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,810
<font color="yellow">- Feeling Camping.
- That's what I'm talking about.</font>

890
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,840
<font color="yellow">I'll get a handkerchief
ready to wipe their tears.</font>

891
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,140
<font color="yellow">Go set up the tent.</font>

892
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,040
<font color="yellow">This is the famous yellow corvina
from Beopsungpo.</font>

893
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,040
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

894
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:52,210
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

895
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,270
<font color="yellow">I wanted to feed you
some home-made cooking.</font>

896
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not making you uncomfortable, am I?</font>

897
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,310
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

898
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,310
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin probably feels at home.</font>

899
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,010
<font color="yellow">Like he's with his mother-in-law.</font>

900
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,710
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay, Manager Lee?
- I'm fine.</font>

901
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,310
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. Here you go. Eat up, Manager Lee.</font>

902
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,510
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Here.</font>

903
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,070
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

904
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
<font color="yellow">You have...</font>

905
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,970
<font color="yellow">a beautiful house.</font>

906
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,570
<font color="yellow">It's my daughter's work.</font>

907
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,940
<font color="yellow">I didn't even pay for it.</font>

908
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,640
<font color="yellow">Ji An's running late.</font>

909
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,810
<font color="yellow">She said she'd come early.</font>

910
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,640
<font color="yellow">Speaking of the devil.</font>

911
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,110
<font color="yellow">- Sorry, I'm late.
- Hello.</font>

912
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:35,870
<font color="yellow">We started without you.</font>

913
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,540
<font color="yellow">Go bring your food.</font>

914
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,110
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be right back.</font>

915
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,770
<font color="yellow">Can you bring some more
vegetables on your way back?</font>

916
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,110
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

917
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,740
<font color="yellow">You should go help her, Ho Jin.</font>

918
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,310
<font color="yellow">You should.</font>

919
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,370
<font color="yellow">Do you want to come?</font>

920
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,510
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

921
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,840
<font color="yellow">- Here you go.
- Thank you.</font>

922
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,440
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

923
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,480
<font color="yellow">- You should try some, too.
- Don't worry about me.</font>

924
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,200
<font color="yellow">- It's uncomfortable, isn't it?
- What?</font>

925
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,510
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

926
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,540
<font color="yellow">She's always been good to me.
The food is delicious, too.</font>

927
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,240
<font color="yellow">- She's a good cook.
- I see.</font>

928
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,270
<font color="yellow">- Strange, right?
- Yes.</font>

929
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:29,570
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

930
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,170
<font color="yellow">It feels like my mom's cooking. I love it.</font>

931
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:35,440
<font color="yellow">Joon's a good cook, too,</font>

932
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,690
<font color="yellow">but his food isn't quite my style.
It doesn't have depth.</font>

933
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:40,240
<font color="yellow">I'm a good cook, too.</font>

934
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:43,770
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

935
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,740
<font color="yellow">- You don't believe me?
- I do.</font>

936
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,640
<font color="yellow">I'm just like my mom.</font>

937
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:51,010
<font color="yellow">I don't do housekeeping,
but I'm a good cook.</font>

938
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:52,440
<font color="yellow">I'll cook for you some time.</font>

939
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

940
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,170
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

941
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,940
<font color="yellow">- Shall we go?
- Yes.</font>

942
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,040
<font color="yellow">Do you like this kind of alcohol?</font>

943
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,040
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to try some.</font>

944
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:12,670
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on landing
"War Terminator".</font>

945
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:13,710
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

946
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,390
<font color="yellow">How does it feel to be in such a big movie?</font>

947
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,410
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd overwhelm me,</font>

948
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,220
<font color="yellow">but I'm excited actually.
I'm looking forward to it.</font>

949
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,040
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

950
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,570
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd make it when I first saw you.</font>

951
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,810
<font color="yellow">I had faith in you.</font>

952
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,870
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab says he's the one who raised you,</font>

953
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,370
<font color="yellow">but I've always known.</font>

954
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,010
<font color="yellow">I'm always grateful for Eun Gab.</font>

955
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,940
<font color="yellow">You're a loyal man.</font>

956
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,170
<font color="yellow">I like that.</font>

957
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,220
<font color="yellow">Has it been four years since
we've been working together?</font>

958
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,710
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- You're a fourth grader.</font>

959
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,510
<font color="yellow">In the 5th grade,
you'll win a domestic award or 2.</font>

960
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,840
<font color="yellow">In the sixth grade, you'll go to Cannes.</font>

961
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,970
<font color="yellow">Cannes?</font>

962
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:10,910
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

963
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,510
<font color="yellow">You'll make a fortune like
Kim Soo Hyun and Jang Keun Suk.</font>

964
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,870
<font color="yellow">There will be a building
under your name as well.</font>

965
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,040
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab doesn't even drink any more.</font>

966
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,640
<font color="yellow">He has strong will. He's no fun.</font>

967
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,140
<font color="yellow">Should we...</font>

968
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:36,370
<font color="yellow">start working together just the two of us?</font>

969
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:39,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

970
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,810
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding.</font>

971
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,370
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

972
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:08,810
<font color="yellow">You're here early.</font>

973
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,670
<font color="yellow">I came on time.
You're the one who came late.</font>

974
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,440
<font color="yellow">You didn't order any drinks?</font>

975
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,290
<font color="yellow">I don't drink any more. Order for yourself.</font>

976
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,590
<font color="yellow">I will when everyone else comes.</font>

977
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,240
<font color="yellow">Is this where you hang out often?</font>

978
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,910
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's nice, isn't it?</font>

979
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:22,170
<font color="yellow">Not really. I prefer somewhere quieter.</font>

980
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,930
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment soon,
so I'll get to the point.</font>

981
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,920
<font color="yellow">You don't want Kang Ha Neul
being in the movie?</font>

982
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,940
<font color="yellow">- No.
- Why not? I don't understand.</font>

983
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,410
<font color="yellow">He's the one I don't understand.</font>

984
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,970
<font color="yellow">He has no reason to do this movie.</font>

985
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,410
<font color="yellow">The director approves.</font>

986
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,010
<font color="yellow">He won't.</font>

987
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,840
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

988
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,510
<font color="yellow">You know he's dating An So Hee.</font>

989
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,440
<font color="yellow">Is there proof?</font>

990
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,410
<font color="yellow">- You know.
- I don't.</font>

991
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,070
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.</font>

992
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,110
<font color="yellow">So you want him out?</font>

993
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,240
<font color="yellow">The leading roles in an
intimate relationship...</font>

994
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,210
<font color="yellow">will ruin the work environment.</font>

995
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,370
<font color="yellow">You've seen it happen.</font>

996
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,670
<font color="yellow">But I still want him on the movie.</font>

997
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,010
<font color="yellow">His agency invested in your funds, right?</font>

998
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,690
<font color="yellow">That's why you're agreeing to their terms.</font>

999
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,740
<font color="yellow">He's past his prime now.</font>

1000
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,210
<font color="yellow">- We should rule him out.
- What if I disagree?</font>

1001
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,670
<font color="yellow">Manager Kim of CJ Entertainment...</font>

1002
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,670
<font color="yellow">and the CEO of An So Hee's agency
are waiting for me nearby.</font>

1003
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,060
<font color="yellow">We're going to meet up and
persuade the director together.</font>

1004
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,970
<font color="yellow">Look at the eyes of the shark.
They look empty of emotions.</font>

1005
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,270
<font color="yellow">Scary, isn't it?</font>

1006
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,640
<font color="yellow">Don't go see the director.
Kang Ha Neul is out of the picture.</font>

1007
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,840
<font color="yellow">That's some sensible thinking.</font>

1008
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,210
<font color="yellow">And from now on,</font>

1009
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,210
<font color="yellow">you don't have a say in the casting.
That's my job.</font>

1010
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,670
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm busy, too.</font>

1011
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,510
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

1012
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,440
<font color="yellow">You're really not drinking.
You're awfully strong willed.</font>

1013
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:43,110
<font color="yellow">That's so boring.</font>

1014
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,930
<font color="yellow">I want to pluck out the eyes of that shark.</font>

1015
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,740
<font color="yellow">That's a female shark, right?</font>

1016
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:48,670
<font color="yellow">I'll go now.</font>

1017
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,540
<font color="yellow">Hello? Are you with Young Bin?</font>

1018
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,470
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Tell him this.</font>

1019
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,810
<font color="yellow">Kang Ha Neul is out.</font>

1020
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,570
<font color="yellow">It's all taken care of.</font>

1021
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,070
<font color="yellow">Really? How?</font>

1022
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,070
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

1023
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,440
<font color="yellow">Where's Young Bin?</font>

1024
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,010
<font color="yellow">He's with Ms. Kang now.</font>

1025
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,770
<font color="yellow">Who?</font>

1026
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,470
<font color="yellow">She invited him over to her place.</font>

1027
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,970
<font color="yellow">He's having dinner with her.</font>

1028
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:19,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me this just now?</font>

1029
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,340
<font color="yellow">You're telling everything late.</font>

1030
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,520
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting so worked up?</font>

1031
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,740
<font color="yellow">I didn't think it was important
enough to tell you.</font>

1032
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,040
<font color="yellow">You drive me crazy.</font>

1033
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,170
<font color="yellow">You jerk!</font>

1034
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:33,710
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

1035
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,910
<font color="yellow">Did she shred a dried fish
by hand and make food for him?</font>

1036
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,270
<font color="yellow">My gosh. How did you know?</font>

1037
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:44,270
<font color="yellow">So he's there now, right?</font>

1038
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,970
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

1039

1040
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:09,970
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

1041
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:11,610
<font color="yellow">No reason.</font>

1042
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,870
<font color="yellow">They left.</font>

1043
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,070
<font color="yellow">Let's talk inside.</font>

1044
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,770
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can't visit you.
I used to come by all the time.</font>

1045
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,940
<font color="yellow">You haven't been here since
you became successful.</font>

1046
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:24,710
<font color="yellow">I know. Let's just talk inside.</font>

1047
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,140
<font color="yellow"><i>(RICE CRACKER)</i></font>

1048
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:33,640
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

1049
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,010
<font color="yellow">You like rice crackers.
You used to eat this every day.</font>

1050
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,310
<font color="yellow">I don't eat it these days.</font>

1051
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,660
<font color="yellow">I mean, there are so many delicious things.</font>

1052
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,210
<font color="yellow">You've changed.</font>

1053
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,940
<font color="yellow">You're the one who has changed.</font>

1054
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,710
<font color="yellow">You're condescending and
disrespectful towards me now.</font>

1055
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you and your foul mouth.</font>

1056
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,110
<font color="yellow">When was I condescending to you?
We just have different opinions.</font>

1057
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:56,920
<font color="yellow">Right, we think differently now.</font>

1058
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,140
<font color="yellow">Very differently, in fact.</font>

1059
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you meet with Young Bin?</font>

1060
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,930
<font color="yellow">I can't even meet with an actor
in my agency as the co-CEO?</font>

1061
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:09,840
<font color="yellow">You should've either given me
a heads-up or let me join.</font>

1062
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:12,750
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking as if I have
some sort of a hidden agenda?</font>

1063
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,640
<font color="yellow">You did the same thing when you
stole actors from other agencies.</font>

1064
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,090
<font color="yellow">You invited them over to
your place for the dried fish dish...</font>

1065
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,390
<font color="yellow">and made cheonggukjang for them.</font>

1066
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:23,170
<font color="yellow">What is on your mind these days?</font>

1067
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,440
<font color="yellow">You tried to sell the company,
came to our meeting,</font>

1068
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,110
<font color="yellow">and met with Young Bin secretly.</font>

1069
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,040
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking? Tell me.</font>

1070
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:30,810
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

1071
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:33,550
<font color="yellow">Do you think the company...</font>

1072
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:36,070
<font color="yellow">is yours?</font>

1073
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,740
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1074
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,710
<font color="yellow">It's ours.</font>

1075
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,840
<font color="yellow">You worked hard to lay foundation for it,</font>

1076
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,160
<font color="yellow">and I've been working like
a dog to grow it, so it's ours.</font>

1077
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,510
<font color="yellow">It's mine.</font>

1078
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:55,970
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1079
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,940
<font color="yellow">Go home before I let my dog off its leash.</font>

1080
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,040
<font color="yellow">It's yours?</font>

1081
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,170
<font color="yellow">- Are you tired?
- Yes.</font>

1082
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,810
<font color="yellow">I was so uncomfortable there.</font>

1083
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:24,750
<font color="yellow">You probably felt the same.</font>

1084
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,720
<font color="yellow">Yes. I was a little uncomfortable, too.</font>

1085
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,070
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang was there,</font>

1086
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,240
<font color="yellow">and Ji An was there, too.</font>

1087
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:32,810
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1088
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:35,570
<font color="yellow">About Ms. Kang.</font>

1089
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:39,410
<font color="yellow">I was weirded out by what she said.</font>

1090
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,840
<font color="yellow">I was stressed out because
of what you said.</font>

1091
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,620
<font color="yellow">- Why? I didn't even say much.
- Whatever.</font>

1092
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,360
<font color="yellow">You're the one who told Eun Gab everything.</font>

1093
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,000
<font color="yellow">- Why aren't you saying anything?
- I don't want to talk to you.</font>

1094
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,600
<font color="yellow">You just have to get even with me.</font>

1095
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,840
<font color="yellow">All right. I won't be like that.
You stop it, too.</font>

1096
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:03,570
<font color="yellow">You don't have to work with
Ha Neul any more. It worked out.</font>

1097
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,050
<font color="yellow">Still, I don't feel that great.</font>

1098
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,880
<font color="yellow">Right. They're going out,
so I get why you're down.</font>

1099
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,210
<font color="yellow">- What can you do, though?
- You're right.</font>

1100
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,940
<font color="yellow">I'm aware of it.</font>

1101
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,180
<font color="yellow">So Hee is our friend, you know.</font>

1102
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:20,210
<font color="yellow">Her dating someone outside of our circle...</font>

1103
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,770
<font color="yellow">shouldn't really upset us that much...</font>

1104
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:22,770
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1105
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,840
<font color="yellow">Just say, "Cheer up, friend."</font>

1106
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:26,850
<font color="yellow">Can't you try to make me feel better?</font>

1107
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:28,430
<font color="yellow">What was that about? That was so cold.</font>

1108
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,540
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

1109
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:31,470
<font color="yellow">Friend.</font>

1110
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,040
<font color="yellow">Cheer up. We have to work hard, you know.</font>

1111
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,510
<font color="yellow">- You're my manager, indeed.
- Of course I am.</font>

1112
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,810
<font color="yellow">Joon and Turtle must be having fun.
They haven't even called.</font>

1113
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,170
<font color="yellow">You're right. Shall I try calling them?</font>

1114
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,540
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

1115
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's Young Bin.</font>

1116
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:56,910
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1117
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,570
<font color="yellow">What do you think?
The two of us are just camping out here.</font>

1118
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:02,740
<font color="yellow">Just the two of you?</font>

1119
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,740
<font color="yellow">No one came because it's too far.</font>

1120
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,210
<font color="yellow">About 400 mosquitos are keeping us company.</font>

1121
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,120
<font color="yellow">Turtle insisted that we should
camp inside the mountain,</font>

1122
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,310
<font color="yellow">so even the ones who came
all the way here left.</font>

1123
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,120
<font color="yellow">You love to blame other
people for everything.</font>

1124
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,180
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- Give it to me.</font>

1125
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,840
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1126
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:22,110
<font color="yellow">Joon's mood swings are annoying me so much.</font>

1127
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:26,240
<font color="yellow">Stop fighting and just come home.</font>

1128
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:28,970
<font color="yellow">Thanks, you're the best.</font>

1129
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:31,440
<font color="yellow">We'll go there, right? Let's go today.</font>

1130
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,270
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1131
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:36,490
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's eat some instant noodles.
We'll be there soon.</font>

1132
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:38,140
<font color="yellow">Let's eat the noodles.</font>

1133
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,510
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You have to make it.</font>

1134
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:46,540
<font color="yellow">Joon, I don't think anyone will come.
Let's give up.</font>

1135
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,140
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1136
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,110
<font color="yellow">It'll take forever to clean up.</font>

1137
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:01,070
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- There's too much meat left.</font>

1138
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,610
<font color="yellow">Where are we now?
Do you know where we're going?</font>

1139
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,340
<font color="yellow">How would I know?</font>

1140
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,350
<font color="yellow">The last time I went camping
was when I was a little boy.</font>

1141
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,140
<font color="yellow">I have no idea where we are right now.</font>

1142
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,070
<font color="yellow">We have to stay calm and collected.</font>

1143
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,170
<font color="yellow">"Stay focused. Where do we have to go?"</font>

1144
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,880
<font color="yellow">Did I sound like the game character?</font>

1145
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,970
<font color="yellow">Which way do we have to go, seriously?</font>

1146
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:31,010
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I thought you were
Jun Kunimura. I want your autograph.</font>

1147
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:32,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh, seriously.</font>

1148
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,540
<font color="yellow">Hey, shall we call 911?</font>

1149
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
<font color="yellow">I'm an actor.</font>

1150
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,120
<font color="yellow">They'll write articles about me.</font>

1151
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,140
<font color="yellow">Actor? Whatever.
What do you want to do, then?</font>

1152
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,170
<font color="yellow">Let's just sleep here...</font>

1153
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,270
<font color="yellow">and go home tomorrow.</font>

1154
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,840
<font color="yellow">That's crazy. There are over
400 frogs here. We can't sleep here.</font>

1155
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,270
<font color="yellow">Oh, my life.</font>

1156
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,570
<font color="yellow">What on earth am I doing here?</font>

1157
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,220
<font color="yellow">We don't even have sleeping bags.
What are we doing here?</font>

1158
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,670
<font color="yellow">Joon. We won't be attacked
by wild animals, right?</font>

1159
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,610
<font color="yellow">I'm seriously hoping that
a tiger shows up and takes you.</font>

1160
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,780
<font color="yellow">Is it because we're inside the mountain?
It's cold.</font>

1161
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,710
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1162
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,330
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me. You're disgusting.</font>

1163
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:22,070
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so cold.
I'll turn around so that our backs touch.</font>

1164
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,230
<font color="yellow">This is more disgusting.
Get your bottom away from me.</font>

1165
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,740
<font color="yellow">Go away.</font>

1166
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,610
<font color="yellow">Hey. You just heard that sound, right?</font>

1167
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:37,970
<font color="yellow">What sound?</font>

1168
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,910
<font color="yellow">What if there's a wild animal outside?
It could be a wild boar.</font>

1169
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:44,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh, here we go again.
You're seriously so paranoid.</font>

1170
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:48,310
<font color="yellow">There must be something outside.</font>

1171
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,810
<font color="yellow">Stop! Stop it seriously. I'm so scared!</font>

1172
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,270
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

1173
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:04,640
<font color="yellow">Let's get out of here...</font>

1174
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,210
<font color="yellow">- and call 911.
- We can't do that.</font>

1175
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,110
<font color="yellow">It could ruin my career as an actor.</font>

1176
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,640
<font color="yellow">Joon, no one even knows you.
No one will write articles about this.</font>

1177
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:18,910
<font color="yellow">Still, we can't.</font>

1178
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
<font color="yellow">Let's just sleep.</font>

1179
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,740
<font color="yellow">Everything will be fine if we fall asleep.</font>

1180
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,440
<font color="yellow">I'm so cold and scared.</font>

1181
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,410
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

1182
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:56,610
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1183
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,110
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here?
- I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

1184
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:04,670
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

1185
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,370
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

1186
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,690
<font color="yellow">I can trust you that
everything is fine, right?</font>

1187
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:13,770
<font color="yellow">Honey. When we were dating,</font>

1188
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:16,240
<font color="yellow">you had a dog, right? The one
that lived for a long time.</font>

1189
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,670
<font color="yellow">Arong?</font>

1190
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,640
<font color="yellow">That dog started throwing a hissy
fit when it got older, right?</font>

1191
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:23,240
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1192
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,290
<font color="yellow">It started when Arong turned 10 years old.</font>

1193
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,350
<font color="yellow">She started throwing tantrums
and didn't even eat her food.</font>

1194
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,910
<font color="yellow">She started biting me, too.
She was never like that before.</font>

1195
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,620
<font color="yellow">I guess she changed because she got older.</font>

1196
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,440
<font color="yellow">- You mean Arong?
- She tried to bite me today.</font>

1197
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,240
<font color="yellow">Shall I bite back?</font>

1198
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,820
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

1199
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,740
<font color="yellow">Honey, you and Yoo Bin are
everything in my life.</font>

1200
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:52,140
<font color="yellow">It must be a midlife crisis.
Shall I take you to a doctor?</font>

1201
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:55,370
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
You just don't get it.</font>

1202
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:59,010
<font color="yellow">- Just go in and sleep.
- You go in and sleep.</font>

1203
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:01,810
<font color="yellow">- Turn off the TV.
- Okay.</font>

1204
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,340
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1205
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,510
<font color="yellow">Here. Try it. It's a little hot.</font>

1206
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:37,150
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to eat with us suddenly?</font>

1207
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,840
<font color="yellow">Since when did we need a
reason to eat together?</font>

1208
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,370
<font color="yellow">You usually don't eat lunch.</font>

1209
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you treating us
to barbecue for lunch?</font>

1210
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,190
<font color="yellow">Are you doing this because I met with Ms.
Kang yesterday?</font>

1211
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,110
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

1212
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:48,610
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

1213
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,170
<font color="yellow">Just eat. Eat up, guys.
Tenderloin is the most tender.</font>

1214
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,210
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

1215
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,610
<font color="yellow">By the way, what did Ms. Kang say to you?</font>

1216
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,930
<font color="yellow">Nothing much. She just said she's
looking forward to working with me.</font>

1217
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:03,170
<font color="yellow">She's trying to win you over to
her side because you're popular.</font>

1218
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,540
<font color="yellow">That dried fish dish was very delicious.</font>

1219
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,400
<font color="yellow">She tore the fish into
small strips by hand.</font>

1220
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:10,440
<font color="yellow">She does that all the time.</font>

1221
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,270
<font color="yellow">She does it for everyone.</font>

1222
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:14,810
<font color="yellow">She also made cheonggukjang, right?</font>

1223
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,970
<font color="yellow">She uses that old trick
of hers over and over.</font>

1224
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:22,810
<font color="yellow">Here, eat this.</font>

1225
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,270
<font color="yellow">What has gotten into you?</font>

1226
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not used to it, either.
It's making me cringe, too.</font>

1227
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,840
<font color="yellow">You make your own wraps, then.</font>

1228
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:34,970
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

1229
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,740
<font color="yellow">- Hey, guys.
- You made it.</font>

1230
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,050
<font color="yellow">Are you guys coming from the mountain?</font>

1231
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,070
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Hello.</font>

1232
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,070
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

1233
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,770
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Goodness.</font>

1234
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare touch me.</font>

1235
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:49,640
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

1236
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,540
<font color="yellow">You're the one who did it!</font>

1237
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,000
<font color="yellow">- What's going on?
- What's wrong?</font>

1238
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:54,910
<font color="yellow">You idiots, what are you doing right now?</font>

1239
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,330
<font color="yellow">Did you two have a fight or what?</font>

1240
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:59,410
<font color="yellow">No, we didn't. I woke up at
night because I was too cold...</font>

1241
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:02,240
<font color="yellow">and noticed that he was
hugging me from behind.</font>

1242
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,740
<font color="yellow">His thing was touching my behind...</font>

1243
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,840
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, seriously.
- Darn it!</font>

1244
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,110
<font color="yellow">Hey, tell the truth.</font>

1245
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,190
<font color="yellow">You're the one who turned around
and had your back touch my...</font>

1246
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,370
<font color="yellow">Stop it, seriously!</font>

1247
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,340
<font color="yellow">You two went camping to meet girls.</font>

1248
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,940
<font color="yellow">Did you end up shooting
"Brokeback Mountain" instead or what?</font>

1249
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,840
<font color="yellow">- "Brokeback Mountain".
- You piece of...</font>

1250
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:19,210
<font color="yellow">- You little...
- Enough, guys.</font>

1251
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,770
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that you two...</font>

1252
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,550
<font color="yellow">did something we should
be worried about inside the tent?</font>

1253
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,340
<font color="yellow">I respect your personal taste,</font>

1254
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,040
<font color="yellow">but don't go overboard, all right?</font>

1255
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:32,710
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what happened to So Hee?</font>

1256
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,550
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- She got hospitalized...</font>

1257
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,910
<font color="yellow">in the middle of a shoot due to overwork.</font>

1258
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:42,240
<font color="yellow">- When did that happen?
- Early this morning.</font>

1259
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:45,010
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm telling you this now?</font>

1260
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,610
<font color="yellow">You must not visit her at the hospital.</font>

1261
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,220
<font color="yellow">Reporters are literally
camping out at the hospital.</font>

1262
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:53,910
<font color="yellow">Just send her some flowers instead.</font>

1263
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,970
<font color="yellow">Get Ho Jin to arrange it.
Get it delivered there.</font>

1264
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,370
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, Young Bin.</font>

1265
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:04,540
<font color="yellow">Both you and I know that you like her.</font>

1266
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:06,890
<font color="yellow">But other people can't know about it.</font>

1267
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,650
<font color="yellow">It cannot get out of this circle.
It's our secret. Got it?</font>

1268
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:10,840
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Got it.</font>

1269
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,360
<font color="yellow">You saw how the director
treated Ha Neul, right?</font>

1270
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,130
<font color="yellow">You can't afford to be distracted.</font>

1271
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,370
<font color="yellow">You must focus on work, okay?
Just think about the film.</font>

1272
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,440
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. That won't happen.</font>

1273
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:22,070
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1274
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,540
<font color="yellow">- Hey, order more food.
- Okay.</font>

1275
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,370
<font color="yellow">- What do you want to eat?
- Tenderloin.</font>

1276
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:27,740
<font color="yellow">- Turn the grill on.
- Excuse me!</font>

1277
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:29,110
<font color="yellow">Joon, Joon.</font>

1278
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:31,340
<font color="yellow">- One more serving of this, please.
- Sure.</font>

1279
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:32,870
<font color="yellow">- Not this one.
- Then what is it?</font>

1280
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,310
<font color="yellow">Listen. You have to keep a
watchful eye on Young Bin.</font>

1281
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:41,070
<font color="yellow">Do not let him visit
An So Hee at the hospital. Got it?</font>

1282
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,060
<font color="yellow">He'll probably go, though.
You know how Young Bin is.</font>

1283
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,170
<font color="yellow">- That's why I'm telling you this.
- You're right.</font>

1284
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,070
<font color="yellow">Think about it.
A girl he loves is hospitalized.</font>

1285
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,690
<font color="yellow">How would he be feeling right now?</font>

1286
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:54,770
<font color="yellow">I'll start crying the minute I
hear that my wife is hospitalized.</font>

1287
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,070
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best to stop him.</font>

1288
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,970
<font color="yellow">Actors are not exactly the
most stable people, you know.</font>

1289
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,570
<font color="yellow">They get serious mood swings.</font>

1290
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:06,110
<font color="yellow">They're moody and sensitive.
They can be blunt, too.</font>

1291
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,070
<font color="yellow">They let it all out, and
that's when things blow up.</font>

1292
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,670
<font color="yellow">Hence, you have to coddle and
treat him tenderly at all times.</font>

1293
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,910
<font color="yellow">- I will.
- Also, you have to call me...</font>

1294
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,740
<font color="yellow">and let me know right away if
he has any dinner meetings.</font>

1295
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,410
<font color="yellow">I didn't think that meeting with
Ms. Kang would be a problem.</font>

1296
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want to switch to
the rope she's holding?</font>

1297
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,810
<font color="yellow">That rope is rotten.</font>

1298
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,570
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim. You're having problems with
Ms. Kang, aren't you?</font>

1299
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,510
<font color="yellow">There are no problems.
It's just a power struggle.</font>

1300
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,740
<font color="yellow">Even animals fight for hierarchy, you know.</font>

1301
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:40,610
<font color="yellow">Whenever you talk about her, it
sounds like you really hate her.</font>

1302
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,010
<font color="yellow">I don't hate her.</font>

1303
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:46,470
<font color="yellow">You know that she's my mentor.</font>

1304
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,760
<font color="yellow">She taught me how to do my job...</font>

1305
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:50,440
<font color="yellow">and groomed me.</font>

1306
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,740
<font color="yellow">She even made me the co-CEO,
so I'm grateful for her help.</font>

1307
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:59,640
<font color="yellow">I know how to be grateful, you silly.</font>

1308
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,470
<font color="yellow">- Why are you chuckling?
- Sorry, don't mind me.</font>

1309
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,670
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You should learn
from me, all right?</font>

1310
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:10,740
<font color="yellow">I'm such a great textbook.</font>

1311
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,970
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm going to...</font>

1312
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,570
<font color="yellow">kill you if you stab me in the back later.</font>

1313
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,290
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about all of a sudden?</font>

1314
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,710
<font color="yellow">What's keeping you so busy?</font>

1315
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,050
<font color="yellow">You don't even get jobs because
you're not a good lawyer.</font>

1316
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,770
<font color="yellow">I just want to ask you something.</font>

1317
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,110
<font color="yellow">You know that my agency
is incorporated, right?</font>

1318
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,440
<font color="yellow">What can I do to dismiss the co-CEO?</font>

1319
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:30,940
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1320
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:33,380
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

1321
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:38,240
<font color="yellow">I'm asking just in case.
Just in case I need to know.</font>

1322
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,960
<font color="yellow">- Yes, go ahead.
- Shall I learn from this?</font>

1323
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,240
<font color="yellow">That's correct. We co-own the agency.</font>

1324
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:46,940
<font color="yellow">That's his game plan.</font>

1325
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,170
<font color="yellow">Look at that. This place
is filled with reporters.</font>

1326
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:58,710
<font color="yellow">I see that.</font>

1327
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,320
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Mr. Kim practically
begged you not to visit her.</font>

1328
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,800
<font color="yellow">If he finds out about this, I will...</font>

1329
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,760
<font color="yellow">He'll strangle my neck.</font>

1330
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:12,390
<font color="yellow">You know that I can keep a secret
unlike you. I won't tell him.</font>

1331
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,380
<font color="yellow">There are so many reporters here.
How will you go in?</font>

1332
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,590
<font color="yellow">Do you have any ideas?</font>

1333
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,340
<font color="yellow">I'll think of something.</font>

1334
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,630
<font color="yellow">Let's just send her flowers.</font>

1335
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:24,930
<font color="yellow">Flowers?</font>

1336
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,570
<font color="yellow">- Are you feeling better?
- Yes, I'm fine.</font>

1337
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,170
<font color="yellow">I didn't really have to get hospitalized,</font>

1338
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,930
<font color="yellow">but people at my agency
made a big fuss about it.</font>

1339
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,030
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved to hear that.</font>

1340
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,530
<font color="yellow">Young Bin ordered flowers
to be delivered to you.</font>

1341
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:38,700
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1342
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,470
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can get deliveries
here because of security reasons.</font>

1343
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,910
<font color="yellow">The delivery guy probably
left it in the lobby.</font>

1344
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,770
<font color="yellow">Okay. Tell me that I said thanks.</font>

1345
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,570
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

1346
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,600
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

1347
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,170
<font color="yellow">There's a delivery for you.</font>

1348
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,170
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

1349
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,130
<font color="yellow">- It's me.
- You totally surprised me.</font>

1350
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,840
<font color="yellow">How did you get in here?
No one is allowed in here.</font>

1351
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,770
<font color="yellow">It was like shooting an adventure film.</font>

1352
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,470
<font color="yellow">I came in through the back door
and gave reporters the slip.</font>

1353
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:15,000
<font color="yellow">Then I had to show
my face to the staff here.</font>

1354
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,750
<font color="yellow">I took photos with them and
gave them my autograph.</font>

1355
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:18,700
<font color="yellow">You could get into deep trouble.</font>

1356
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,630
<font color="yellow">What is all this?
You bought a huge bouquet.</font>

1357
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,540
<font color="yellow">I heard you're sick and got worried.
Goodness.</font>

1358
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,400
<font color="yellow">Why did you faint like that?</font>

1359
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,370
<font color="yellow">Well, I thought I was taking
good care of my health.</font>

1360
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:33,270
<font color="yellow">Hey, I've never gotten
flowers from a guy before.</font>

1361
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,030
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

1362
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,320
<font color="yellow">You should've asked your boyfriend for one.</font>

1363
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,770
<font color="yellow">Ha Neul and I broke up.</font>

1364
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:44,630
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

1365
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:47,530
<font color="yellow">No specific reason. It just happened.</font>

1366
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,200
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

1367
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:54,030
<font color="yellow">In what way? Health-wise
or about the breakup?</font>

1368
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,400
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

1369
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:57,430
<font color="yellow">I feel fine physically,</font>

1370
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:02,130
<font color="yellow">and I'm sure I'll be fine
with other things, too.</font>

1371
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:03,570
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1372
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:06,900
<font color="yellow">By the way, don't you have to get going?
I know that you're busy.</font>

1373
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,310
<font color="yellow">I'm technically unemployed now.</font>

1374
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:10,930
<font color="yellow">I'll get going so that
you can get some rest.</font>

1375
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,610
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is waiting for me in the car, too.</font>

1376
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,370
<font color="yellow">My gosh. He called me and
pretended to be elsewhere.</font>

1377
01:10:16,370 --> 01:10:18,100
<font color="yellow">I must say, he has become a real manager.</font>

1378
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,270
<font color="yellow">Hey, he got a promotion.</font>

1379
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:22,230
<font color="yellow">- He got a promotion?
- Yes.</font>

1380
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,340
<font color="yellow">Then we should grab a drink
and celebrate together.</font>

1381
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,200
<font color="yellow">Shall we grab a beer?</font>

1382
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,600
<font color="yellow">I really want to drink now.</font>

1383
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:32,770
<font color="yellow">Let's get together for drinks
when my drama is over.</font>

1384
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about drinking?
You're sick.</font>

1385
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,670
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1386
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,500
<font color="yellow">I haven't had any drinks
in such a long time.</font>

1387
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,530
<font color="yellow">I've been staying away
from drinking lately.</font>

1388
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,300
<font color="yellow">We'll go out, right?</font>

1389
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,570
<font color="yellow">I should get going now.</font>

1390
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:48,030
<font color="yellow">Stay a little longer. I'm bored.</font>

1391
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,000
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back tomorrow.
- You're sure, right?</font>

1392
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,500
<font color="yellow">- Just stay in bed.
- All right.</font>

1393
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,200
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

1394
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,200
<font color="yellow">So Hee.</font>

1395
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,130
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

1396
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:23,160
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

1397
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:25,730
<font color="yellow">You took longer than I thought.</font>

1398
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,560
<font color="yellow">Did you see her?</font>

1399
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:30,260
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1400
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:32,230
<font color="yellow">You're really something.</font>

1401
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,210
<font color="yellow">How is So Hee? Is she all right?</font>

1402
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,390
<font color="yellow">- Yes, she's fine.
- I'm glad to hear that.</font>

1403
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:40,730
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

1404
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:44,530
<font color="yellow">I told her how I feel about her.</font>

1405
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:45,990
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1406
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1407
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:29,760
<font color="yellow">Synced & ripped by bozxphd
Subtitles by VIU</font>

1408
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,040
<font color="yellow"><i>(NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW)</i></font>

1409
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,740
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the child actor?</font>

1410
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,470
<font color="yellow">My performance will make you admire me.</font>

1411
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,870
<font color="yellow">Hey, let go.</font>

1412
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,540
<font color="yellow">- You said it was okay.
- I thought it was okay.</font>

1413
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,850
<font color="yellow">What's he doing? Is there something
I don't know on his schedule?</font>

1414
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,070
<font color="yellow">What is this every single time?</font>

1415
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,810
<font color="yellow">We have to lie and inconvenience people.</font>

1416
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:49,720
<font color="yellow">Is there something going on with
Mr. Cha Young Bin?</font>

1417
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,110
<font color="yellow">Is he seeing someone or what?</font>

1418
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,510
<font color="yellow">Get out!</font>

1419
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,410
<font color="yellow">All right, guys. Keep fighting.</font>

1420
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,540
<font color="yellow">- Do it in the car.
- Hey!</font>

1421
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:58,570
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- What?</font>

1422
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,970
<font color="yellow">I'm so distressed because of a blockhead.</font>
