<font color="yellow">(Entourage)</font>

2
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,558
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's here?</font>

3
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,558
<font color="yellow">Well, this is the address I got.</font>

4
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,628
<font color="yellow">Why do they want to meet here at this hour?</font>

5
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:40,798
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

6
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:42,998
<font color="yellow">They're not picking up.</font>

7
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:45,498
<font color="yellow">They told me to come to the basement of this building.</font>

8
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:48,928
<font color="yellow">I want to go home.</font>

9
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,728
<font color="yellow">By the way, I can't go in with you.</font>

10
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:54,258
<font color="yellow">- You can go. - Come on, let's go.</font>

11
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:55,358
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

12
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,628
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

13
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,728
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What is with this place?</font>

14
00:01:09,628 --> 00:01:11,228
<font color="yellow">Are we being sold off somewhere?</font>

15
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:13,058
<font color="yellow">Is this a haunted house?</font>

16
00:01:14,428 --> 00:01:15,958
<font color="yellow">What if they steal our organs? Should we go?</font>

17
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:17,758
<font color="yellow">Are you scared?</font>

18
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,628
<font color="yellow">Don't be scared. You're not a kid.</font>

19
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:24,128
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

20
00:01:24,228 --> 00:01:27,128
<font color="yellow">What is going on? This is driving me crazy.</font>

21
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:32,628
<font color="yellow">- I think this is the wrong place. - I think I hear something.</font>

22
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:35,728
<font color="yellow">No, you go.</font>

23
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:38,098
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

24
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:48,958
<font color="yellow">Cha Young Bin?</font>

25
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:11,328
<font color="yellow">Welcome. It was hard to find your way, right?</font>

26
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,158
<font color="yellow">- Sit down. - Okay.</font>

27
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,058
<font color="yellow">Isn't it a surprise?</font>

28
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:21,058
<font color="yellow">It looks like a worn-down house,</font>

29
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,298
<font color="yellow">but there is a luxurious lounge in the basement.</font>

30
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:25,128
<font color="yellow">This is our secret lounge.</font>

31
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,258
<font color="yellow">We hang out like this all the time.</font>

32
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,998
<font color="yellow">We have wine and champagne.</font>

33
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:32,758
<font color="yellow">There are karaoke machines inside.</font>

34
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:34,198
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

35
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,658
<font color="yellow">we even have bedrooms.</font>

36
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:41,998
<font color="yellow">- Do you like it? - Sure.</font>

37
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,098
<font color="yellow">If you sign with us, you can use the place freely.</font>

38
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,498
<font color="yellow">You can bring people here.</font>

39
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:49,198
<font color="yellow">No one will know what you do in here.</font>

40
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:58,128
<font color="yellow">I was surprised. I didn't know such places existed.</font>

41
00:02:58,158 --> 00:02:59,158
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

42
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:03,198
<font color="yellow">I don't like him. He's the type of person I hate.</font>

43
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,528
<font color="yellow">Really? Let's not sign with them then.</font>

44
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,928
<font color="yellow">You care about what I think at this point in the game?</font>

45
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,958
<font color="yellow">- Are you mad at me? - No.</font>

46
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,458
<font color="yellow">I know Mr. Kim made a mistake, but...</font>

47
00:03:23,358 --> 00:03:25,958
<font color="yellow">He signed without discussing it with me.</font>

48
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,328
<font color="yellow">You also made the decision without discussing it with me.</font>

49
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,328
<font color="yellow">Well, that's...</font>

50
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:35,498
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll always tell you from now on. Happy?</font>

51
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:36,928
<font color="yellow">Stop sulking.</font>

52
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:44,928
<font color="yellow">Did you see the article on "War Terminator"?</font>

53
00:03:45,498 --> 00:03:46,658
<font color="yellow">They published that you're leaving the film.</font>

54
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:50,228
<font color="yellow">No, Turtle told me not to read it.</font>

55
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:53,498
<font color="yellow">He's worried I'd get hurt from the comments.</font>

56
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,698
<font color="yellow">- I probably deserve it. - At least,</font>

57
00:03:59,568 --> 00:04:01,928
<font color="yellow">it doesn't say you left because of So Hee.</font>

58
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:09,028
<font color="yellow">I thought Ms. Jo would do something, but she didn't.</font>

59
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:11,728
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it weird? - A little.</font>

60
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:16,028
<font color="yellow">Is she going to let it pass after taking the cancellation fee?</font>

61
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:20,258
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Mr. Kim did something.</font>

62
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,228
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

63
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,028
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Enough nonsense.</font>

64
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,458
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

65
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:38,728
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Can't you get over it now?</font>

66
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:41,068
<font color="yellow">Did you read the press release on Young Bin's dropping out?</font>

67
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,128
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful we were civil.</font>

68
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:45,328
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

69
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:49,428
<font color="yellow">You're so broad-minded unlike the rumours.</font>

70
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,828
<font color="yellow">I'm still not in a good mood.</font>

71
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,298
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here to find you Young Bin's replacement.</font>

72
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,098
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

73
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,328
<font color="yellow">Their company will do it for sure.</font>

74
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:01,028
<font color="yellow">The actor is very interested. It will work out.</font>

75
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,158
<font color="yellow">How can I trust what you say?</font>

76
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,398
<font color="yellow">You cancelled after signing the agreement.</font>

77
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:08,028
<font color="yellow">It was a mistake. I'm sorry. I admit.</font>

78
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:09,558
<font color="yellow">This is unexpected, though.</font>

79
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:13,128
<font color="yellow">It shouldn't matter what happens since you no longer work with him.</font>

80
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:14,298
<font color="yellow">You're strange.</font>

81
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:16,098
<font color="yellow">I think it's this room. Come in.</font>

82
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:19,098
<font color="yellow">We haven't decided yet.</font>

83
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:24,628
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? You said you'd do it.</font>

84
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,198
<font color="yellow">We need to think about it.</font>

85
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:30,098
<font color="yellow">Since you're begging me,</font>

86
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:31,558
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to think of it positively.</font>

87
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,958
<font color="yellow">You're a smart guy.</font>

88
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:35,698
<font color="yellow">Your talent was the main actor for a mini series.</font>

89
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:38,528
<font color="yellow">It'd be good for him to step into film this time.</font>

90
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:41,758
<font color="yellow">If we can get to work with Ms. Jo,</font>

91
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,858
<font color="yellow">it doesn't matter what film it is. It's an honour.</font>

92
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:47,858
<font color="yellow">We had a lot of heartache because of Young Bin.</font>

93
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,998
<font color="yellow">We want an actor that's trustworthy.</font>

94
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,298
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

95
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:54,628
<font color="yellow">You two seem to get along, so you should work together.</font>

96
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:58,158
<font color="yellow">This is so hard to eat.</font>

97
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:03,398
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. Why are you crushing this expensive crab?</font>

98
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:04,698
<font color="yellow">I'll help you.</font>

99
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,428
<font color="yellow">- I heard you two worked together. - Yes.</font>

100
00:06:07,528 --> 00:06:09,358
<font color="yellow">You're not like Mr. Kim, are you?</font>

101
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:11,358
<font color="yellow">We won't get along if you are.</font>

102
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,328
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. We're completely different.</font>

103
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:17,328
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim yelled at me all the time when I worked for him.</font>

104
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:21,028
<font color="yellow">He even came to our opening party and yelled at me.</font>

105
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:23,258
<font color="yellow">I hate that.</font>

106
00:06:23,558 --> 00:06:25,858
<font color="yellow">He's so harsh to others but generous to himself.</font>

107
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:30,258
<font color="yellow">Why isn't this opening up? It's so hard to break it.</font>

108
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,358
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating? Do you want me to break it for you?</font>

109
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:35,428
<font color="yellow">I'm eating.</font>

110
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,058
<font color="yellow">I put some on your plate. Eat it.</font>

111
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:49,558
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

112
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,698
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you come to work already?</font>

113
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,398
<font color="yellow">Hello. Are you back?</font>

114
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,428
<font color="yellow">- What do you think of the office? - It's nice.</font>

115
00:06:58,328 --> 00:07:00,258
<font color="yellow">Did you meet with Kang Eun Sol? What did she say?</font>

116
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,558
<font color="yellow">I didn't get a chance yet.</font>

117
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:03,828
<font color="yellow">I'm about to meet her right away.</font>

118
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:06,228
<font color="yellow">You have to hurry up and make her sign with us.</font>

119
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,528
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

120
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,058
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

121
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:15,028
<font color="yellow">As you know, I just got divorced.</font>

122
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:19,558
<font color="yellow">I've been so stressed ever since.</font>

123
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:23,028
<font color="yellow">Doing puzzles makes me feel calmer.</font>

124
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:26,758
<font color="yellow">I was in the middle of it. Can I continue?</font>

125
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:28,998
<font color="yellow">Okay, sure.</font>

126
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:32,258
<font color="yellow">Let's rush the contract. We have to make money.</font>

127
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,828
<font color="yellow">That way, you can give them child support.</font>

128
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:35,998
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

129
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:37,628
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab.</font>

130
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,558
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy to be working for you.</font>

131
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,358
<font color="yellow">Sure. Finish what you were doing.</font>

132
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,428
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Sure.</font>

133
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:53,598
<font color="yellow">Hey, Boss.</font>

134
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:58,398
<font color="yellow">- Who is that? - An old friend of mine.</font>

135
00:07:58,498 --> 00:08:00,998
<font color="yellow">He's a manager that got kicked out by Ok Ja.</font>

136
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:04,128
<font color="yellow">He's a good guy. It's just that he's too solemn.</font>

137
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,958
<font color="yellow">- That's why I brought him. - Is that so?</font>

138
00:08:10,428 --> 00:08:12,028
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

139
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:15,858
<font color="yellow">Well, I feel like you've suddenly become nice.</font>

140
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:18,258
<font color="yellow">Usually, if you found someone...</font>

141
00:08:18,758 --> 00:08:21,198
<font color="yellow">doing puzzles instead of working, you'd swear at them.</font>

142
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,168
<font color="yellow">But you just told him to continue what he was doing.</font>

143
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,498
<font color="yellow">Did you change after your breakup with Young Bin?</font>

144
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,628
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't change. Do you need me to swear at you?</font>

145
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:34,428
<font color="yellow">Also, don't bring up Young Bin's name for a while. Okay?</font>

146
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:40,298
<font color="yellow">Then why did you bring Young Bin's plant?</font>

147
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,668
<font color="yellow">This is expensive. Do you want me to throw it out?</font>

148
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,298
<font color="yellow">Get back to work. Go.</font>

149
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:49,528
<font color="yellow">Okay, Boss. Bye.</font>

150
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,258
<font color="yellow">- Close the door. - Okay.</font>

151
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:20,328
<font color="yellow">Is this the right way?</font>

152
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:23,358
<font color="yellow">I think this lane is closed.</font>

153
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:25,558
<font color="yellow">We're almost there. It's around here.</font>

154
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,098
<font color="yellow">Did you text people to tell them it's your first reality show?</font>

155
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:31,498
<font color="yellow">I sent it out. It's up on social media as well.</font>

156
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:35,128
<font color="yellow">Today is like my birthday. Should we have champagne later?</font>

157
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,798
<font color="yellow">As for birthdays, it's Young Bin's next week.</font>

158
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:40,998
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm going to book a place. The three of us can split the bill.</font>

159
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,428
<font color="yellow">Let's just have dinner with close friends.</font>

160
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:44,558
<font color="yellow">I made too much noise this year.</font>

161
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:47,028
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll just buy you a gift.</font>

162
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,098
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

163
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:51,828
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

164
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:54,398
<font color="yellow">Why did you stop talking?</font>

165
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:58,168
<font color="yellow">We always celebrated your birthday with Mr. Kim.</font>

166
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:00,528
<font color="yellow">What do we do this time?</font>

167
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:03,998
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

168
00:10:11,558 --> 00:10:12,558
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

169
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:15,358
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

170
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:20,858
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

171
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,998
<font color="yellow">That's her. The legendary food truck lady.</font>

172
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,958
<font color="yellow">She does catering for variety show shootings.</font>

173
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:34,428
<font color="yellow">The show becomes a mega hit if it makes her laugh.</font>

174
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,458
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't, the show becomes a flop.</font>

175
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,828
<font color="yellow">- I've heard the story, too. - Are you sure?</font>

176
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:41,798
<font color="yellow">That makes absolutely no sense.</font>

177
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:42,998
<font color="yellow">- Yes, it does. - Yes, it does.</font>

178
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,298
<font color="yellow">Why are you so upset?</font>

179
00:10:48,128 --> 00:10:49,528
<font color="yellow">- What's that thing you do? - That thing?</font>

180
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,398
<font color="yellow">Yes, show us.</font>

181
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,328
<font color="yellow">That's funny.</font>

182
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,258
<font color="yellow">I can never get tired of that one.</font>

183
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:06,528
<font color="yellow">Seo Jin is loving it.</font>

184
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,828
<font color="yellow">Please laugh at my part.</font>

185
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,058
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

186
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,358
<font color="yellow">The prank.</font>

187
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,798
<font color="yellow">- There you are. - There he is.</font>

188
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,358
<font color="yellow">It's a prank.</font>

189
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:22,758
<font color="yellow">We got you.</font>

190
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,758
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Joon.</font>

191
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:28,258
<font color="yellow">The prank was actually on you, not Julien Kang.</font>

192
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:32,728
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

193
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,558
<font color="yellow">It's not that funny.</font>

194
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,828
<font color="yellow">That was hilarious.</font>

195
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:44,028
<font color="yellow">They got me real good.</font>

196
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,958
<font color="yellow">How did you fall for that? And why did you get on your knees?</font>

197
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:49,398
<font color="yellow">I was trying to be funny.</font>

198
00:11:56,698 --> 00:11:57,728
<font color="yellow">She's not laughing.</font>

199
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:01,058
<font color="yellow">I'm doomed.</font>

200
00:12:06,228 --> 00:12:07,258
<font color="yellow">Don't you find that funny?</font>

201
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,558
<font color="yellow">No, I don't.</font>

202
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,458
<font color="yellow">"Cha Joon said he was fooled by Julien Kang's talented acting."</font>

203
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,458
<font color="yellow">"He asks the viewers to stay tuned for the show..."</font>

204
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:20,028
<font color="yellow">"as he will continue to show more of his funny side."</font>

205
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,198
<font color="yellow">"Comments"</font>

206
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:26,098
<font color="yellow">"Julien should've beaten up that Cha Joon guy."</font>

207
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:27,528
<font color="yellow">(Comments)</font>

208
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:28,898
<font color="yellow">"Cha Joon is so boring."</font>

209
00:12:29,598 --> 00:12:31,258
<font color="yellow">"I will remember him as the unfunny one."</font>

210
00:12:32,758 --> 00:12:33,758
<font color="yellow">"Boring."</font>

211
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:35,698
<font color="yellow">"Who is he?"</font>

212
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,858
<font color="yellow">"He should've got beaten up so people wouldn't recognize him."</font>

213
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:43,858
<font color="yellow">It's four in the morning. What on earth are you doing up?</font>

214
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,058
<font color="yellow">I'm doomed.</font>

215
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,658
<font color="yellow">Look at all the mean comments.</font>

216
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,658
<font color="yellow">Go to bed, Joon. They weren't all mean.</font>

217
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,028
<font color="yellow">I saw some nice comments about you.</font>

218
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:54,758
<font color="yellow">The fatigue is getting to me.</font>

219
00:12:58,058 --> 00:13:00,728
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

220
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,928
<font color="yellow">We can do better on the next day of shooting.</font>

221
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:05,928
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - I'm going to bed. You should, too.</font>

222
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:29,858
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Sunshine.</font>

223
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,558
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Did you not get any sleep?</font>

224
00:13:32,798 --> 00:13:33,828
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

225
00:13:34,498 --> 00:13:36,598
<font color="yellow">It hurts when I pee again.</font>

226
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,458
<font color="yellow">Did your prostate thing get worse? Is it in a chronic stage now?</font>

227
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,928
<font color="yellow">But I took good care of it. I even quit road cycling.</font>

228
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,828
<font color="yellow">It's because of stress.</font>

229
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,958
<font color="yellow">You look like you've aged a lot since last night.</font>

230
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,628
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

231
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:51,628
<font color="yellow">You should go to the hospital.</font>

232
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,058
<font color="yellow">No. I'll feel better after a sitz bath.</font>

233
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,728
<font color="yellow">That's gross.</font>

234
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:02,858
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it looks moulded.</font>

235
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,098
<font color="yellow">That's disgusting.</font>

236
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:06,928
<font color="yellow">Do you have any girl problems?</font>

237
00:14:08,628 --> 00:14:10,098
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

238
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:12,398
<font color="yellow">Do you gamble?</font>

239
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,358
<font color="yellow">- No. - What about drugs?</font>

240
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:18,128
<font color="yellow">- I don't do drugs. - I've noticed that...</font>

241
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,228
<font color="yellow">people are writing mean comments about you these days.</font>

242
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:22,758
<font color="yellow">We can get rid of them all.</font>

243
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,798
<font color="yellow">You should let them do that. Please do that.</font>

244
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,758
<font color="yellow">I think actors are like wine.</font>

245
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,128
<font color="yellow">I picture a vineyard in my head when I first look at their faces.</font>

246
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,598
<font color="yellow">I wonder what kind of grapevines I should plant...</font>

247
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,298
<font color="yellow">and how long I'll age the grapes after I harvest them.</font>

248
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:37,898
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

249
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,498
<font color="yellow">I'll make you into the best kind of wine.</font>

250
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,928
<font color="yellow">What I mean is that you'll be paid very well.</font>

251
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,328
<font color="yellow">But I don't keep secrets between myself and the actors.</font>

252
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,398
<font color="yellow">Can I take a look at your phone for a second?</font>

253
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:52,958
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

254
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:56,398
<font color="yellow">You're very handsome.</font>

255
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,028
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

256
00:14:59,628 --> 00:15:01,958
<font color="yellow">your ears aren't your strongest forte.</font>

257
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:04,498
<font color="yellow">Not to mention your jaws.</font>

258
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,128
<font color="yellow">Let's do something about that.</font>

259
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,158
<font color="yellow">- I'm against plastic surgery. - Why?</font>

260
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:12,528
<font color="yellow">Actors these days get work done on their noses, ears, and jaws.</font>

261
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:16,298
<font color="yellow">Our company is very well-connected with the hospitals.</font>

262
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:18,928
<font color="yellow">We are very discreet about it. Oh, and one more thing.</font>

263
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:22,598
<font color="yellow">How's your urinary system? I know a good hospital for that.</font>

264
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:26,958
<font color="yellow">Where is that place?</font>

265
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:31,358
<font color="yellow">One of our room-mates is in need of prostate treatment. Do share.</font>

266
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,998
<font color="yellow">- What? - Stop it.</font>

267
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,298
<font color="yellow">Let's have him undergo a procedure.</font>

268
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:36,528
<font color="yellow">They do that now?</font>

269
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:44,798
<font color="yellow">I feel exhausted. I need something sweet.</font>

270
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:46,828
<font color="yellow">Was it that bad?</font>

271
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:49,628
<font color="yellow">We can't find anyone we like. We should've stayed with Eun Gab.</font>

272
00:15:51,328 --> 00:15:53,858
<font color="yellow">Why is Joon taking so long in the bathroom? I'm hungry.</font>

273
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:57,428
<font color="yellow">He's been in there forever doing a sitz bath.</font>

274
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,328
<font color="yellow">This is hard.</font>

275
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,458
<font color="yellow">This isn't looking good. It hurts even more now.</font>

276
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,458
<font color="yellow">The pain won't go away.</font>

277
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:11,698
<font color="yellow">Look at you. We're going to the hospital tomorrow.</font>

278
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:13,458
<font color="yellow">- I'm fine. - You should go now.</font>

279
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,228
<font color="yellow">Why don't you want to go? Aren't you a grown up?</font>

280
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,598
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it if you don't go.</font>

281
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:19,068
<font color="yellow">Your private part might fall off.</font>

282
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:28,898
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

283
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:37,158
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

284
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:40,198
<font color="yellow">You look like you just saw someone who doesn't belong in here.</font>

285
00:16:40,358 --> 00:16:43,128
<font color="yellow">Did you get an invitation?</font>

286
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,328
<font color="yellow">I did apply for admission, but they didn't get back to me yet.</font>

287
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:50,328
<font color="yellow">I came here to see all the executives of major agencies.</font>

288
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:52,528
<font color="yellow">There has to be an evaluation,</font>

289
00:16:52,698 --> 00:16:54,398
<font color="yellow">but your agency is too small of a company.</font>

290
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,598
<font color="yellow">I meet the standards.</font>

291
00:16:56,428 --> 00:16:57,928
<font color="yellow">I used to be a member here until not so long ago.</font>

292
00:16:58,128 --> 00:17:03,098
<font color="yellow">We all know the evaluation is just a formality.</font>

293
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,198
<font color="yellow">We should still decide on the matter through an internal meeting.</font>

294
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:07,498
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

295
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:11,698
<font color="yellow">Just last month, I was in here drinking tea with you.</font>

296
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,328
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like an outsider now.</font>

297
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:15,698
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to leave me out?</font>

298
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,928
<font color="yellow">Of course, we aren't.</font>

299
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:20,158
<font color="yellow">What gives you the right to be here...</font>

300
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:22,898
<font color="yellow">after starting an agency with someone else's money?</font>

301
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,268
<font color="yellow">They'll get the wrong idea if you say it like that.</font>

302
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:29,268
<font color="yellow">That money was my share and severance pay.</font>

303
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,058
<font color="yellow">Which agency is Young Bin going to choose?</font>

304
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,328
<font color="yellow">How should I know?</font>

305
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,028
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he went to see everyone in this room, but nobody's talking.</font>

306
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,458
<font color="yellow">They're very secretive.</font>

307
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,528
<font color="yellow">Young Bin can look out for himself.</font>

308
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:43,768
<font color="yellow">Look at you trying to be all nonchalant.</font>

309
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,898
<font color="yellow">It's like seeing your divorced wife dating other men.</font>

310
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:51,658
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what that feels like. I've never gotten a divorce.</font>

311
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:54,798
<font color="yellow">Oh, you should know because you've done it once.</font>

312
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,928
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

313
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,098
<font color="yellow">You little brat.</font>

314
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,658
<font color="yellow">I heard everything worked out between you and Ms. Jo.</font>

315
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:06,598
<font color="yellow">Did you have to crawl between her knees or something?</font>

316
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,028
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

317
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:10,158
<font color="yellow">I got down on the ground.</font>

318
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:13,298
<font color="yellow">Accept my application, will you? I'll be going now.</font>

319
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:19,328
<font color="yellow">Why are you all so cautious of me? My agency is just getting started.</font>

320
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,658
<font color="yellow">Are you scared of me?</font>

321
00:18:21,428 --> 00:18:23,928
<font color="yellow">I'll never lay a finger on my fellow executives' actors.</font>

322
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,128
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that. I'll manage it just fine.</font>

323
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:28,928
<font color="yellow">The name of our agency is "Tiger's Den".</font>

324
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,828
<font color="yellow">We're all tigers in our agency.</font>

325
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:35,698
<font color="yellow">I'll eat you all up.</font>

326
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:37,598
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

327
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:48,658
<font color="yellow">Where is Mr. Han?</font>

328
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:53,028
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Boss. - Did he go to that meeting?</font>

329
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:56,298
<font color="yellow">He said he's going to a hospital for Lasik surgery.</font>

330
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:57,958
<font color="yellow">- Lasik surgery? - Yes.</font>

331
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,598
<font color="yellow">It's because he's always looking at puzzles.</font>

332
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,698
<font color="yellow">Go find out which agencies Young Bin is making contact with.</font>

333
00:19:08,098 --> 00:19:09,098
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

334
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:11,628
<font color="yellow">Just do it.</font>

335
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:15,698
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Kim. Your family is in your room.</font>

336
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:17,498
<font color="yellow">Okay. Got it.</font>

337
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,298
<font color="yellow">- Honey, you're here early. - You wanted to have dinner, right?</font>

338
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:23,828
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat something delicious.</font>

339
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,198
<font color="yellow">I came a bit early to look around the place.</font>

340
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,798
<font color="yellow">Do take a look. It's nice, isn't it?</font>

341
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:32,398
<font color="yellow">- It's better than I thought. - I got a good deal on it.</font>

342
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:36,598
<font color="yellow">Didn't that belong at your old office? It's withered.</font>

343
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:39,598
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

344
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:43,458
<font color="yellow">Yoo Bin. Take a look around my office with your mum.</font>

345
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:52,858
<font color="yellow">Yoo Bin.</font>

346
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:55,458
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to say anything?</font>

347
00:19:55,898 --> 00:19:58,768
<font color="yellow">She's not in a good mood right now. She won't talk to me, either.</font>

348
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,358
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

349
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,768
<font color="yellow">She broke up with her best friend.</font>

350
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,828
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

351
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:08,268
<font color="yellow">You should make up with her tomorrow.</font>

352
00:20:09,228 --> 00:20:11,658
<font color="yellow">You heard what your dad said.</font>

353
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:15,198
<font color="yellow">You should make peace with her. Don't wait until it's too late.</font>

354
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,498
<font color="yellow">Are you intending on not talking to her for the rest of your life?</font>

355
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:22,998
<font color="yellow">Answer me, Yoo Bin.</font>

356
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:26,798
<font color="yellow">Why is she so stubborn?</font>

357
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,458
<font color="yellow">Can you talk to her?</font>

358
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,728
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you talking?</font>

359
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:36,928
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

360
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,228
<font color="yellow">Kim Eun Gab.</font>

361
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,528
<font color="yellow">- Are you crying? - No.</font>

362
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:49,958
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

363
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,058
<font color="yellow">He's here. Come on out.</font>

364
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:03,498
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to consult the pastor?</font>

365
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:04,998
<font color="yellow">You said you didn't want to go to the hospital.</font>

366
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:08,058
<font color="yellow">He'll be able to help us with his wisdom.</font>

367
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:10,098
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

368
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:16,728
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

369
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,228
<font color="yellow">I heard that you couldn't renew the contract with someone close.</font>

370
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:26,158
<font color="yellow">That's right. He's been depressed because of that.</font>

371
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:27,158
<font color="yellow">On top of that,</font>

372
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,998
<font color="yellow">he's even crying.</font>

373
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:32,258
<font color="yellow">I wasn't crying. I'm just going through menopause.</font>

374
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:33,928
<font color="yellow">Does that make people cry all the time?</font>

375
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,498
<font color="yellow">I didn't cry all the time.</font>

376
00:21:35,858 --> 00:21:39,528
<font color="yellow">Aren't you sad that our daughter had a fight with her best friend?</font>

377
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,028
<font color="yellow">It is sad.</font>

378
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:43,698
<font color="yellow">It's not because of our daughter. It's about that contract.</font>

379
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:47,758
<font color="yellow">His employee, Joy Jung, told me that he named a flower pot...</font>

380
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:50,128
<font color="yellow">after that actor.</font>

381
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,328
<font color="yellow">Nobody can keep secrets around here.</font>

382
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:55,298
<font color="yellow">Do you name things now?</font>

383
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,558
<font color="yellow">I named it before this happened.</font>

384
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:01,128
<font color="yellow">I only named a few after the big-shots.</font>

385
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:03,058
<font color="yellow">I'm going to throw it away. It's not a problem.</font>

386
00:22:03,158 --> 00:22:05,658
<font color="yellow">- Let's stop wasting his time. - I'm fine. I'm not busy at all.</font>

387
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,828
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else?</font>

388
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:09,898
<font color="yellow">He can't sleep at night.</font>

389
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:12,458
<font color="yellow">He often looks dazed.</font>

390
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,658
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

391
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:20,058
<font color="yellow">You're feeling a sense of loss after losing your favourite actor.</font>

392
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:22,328
<font color="yellow">That is the reason why he cried.</font>

393
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,598
<font color="yellow">- I didn't cry. - It's okay.</font>

394
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:27,258
<font color="yellow">It's a natural, human emotion.</font>

395
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:31,728
<font color="yellow">Ease your mind and accept the fact that he's gone.</font>

396
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,458
<font color="yellow">I don't even have the time to feel depressed.</font>

397
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,698
<font color="yellow">Watch the tone. We're with the pastor.</font>

398
00:22:35,728 --> 00:22:36,828
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

399
00:22:37,828 --> 00:22:38,898
<font color="yellow">Please continue.</font>

400
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:41,698
<font color="yellow">My work is going great. I'm very happy right now.</font>

401
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:44,598
<font color="yellow">I could even hug high-school brats spitting on the streets.</font>

402
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,428
<font color="yellow">I have a good appetite and I'm eating well.</font>

403
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,998
<font color="yellow">- In bed, we're... - Honey.</font>

404
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:51,428
<font color="yellow">I'm saying there's nothing wrong.</font>

405
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,398
<font color="yellow">Please have some.</font>

406
00:22:57,198 --> 00:22:58,198
<font color="yellow">That's hot.</font>

407
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:11,398
<font color="yellow">Every time I get myself tested,</font>

408
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:13,758
<font color="yellow">it's a total humiliation.</font>

409
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,958
<font color="yellow">I've never done anything like this before.</font>

410
00:23:17,058 --> 00:23:20,398
<font color="yellow">How do they do it exactly?</font>

411
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:21,998
<font color="yellow">You don't want to know.</font>

412
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:22,598
<font color="yellow">Mr. Cha Joon? Please come in.
You don't want to know.</font>

413
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:24,198
<font color="yellow">Mr. Cha Joon? Please come in.</font>

414
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:26,558
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

415
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:34,098
<font color="yellow">He's going in.</font>

416
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:40,298
<font color="yellow">Please don't use anything too big.</font>

417
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:54,858
<font color="yellow">I'll get started now.</font>

418
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:56,558
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

419
00:23:58,128 --> 00:23:59,498
<font color="yellow">Can you hold my hand?</font>

420
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:06,258
<font color="yellow">One, two,</font>

421
00:24:06,728 --> 00:24:07,728
<font color="yellow">three.</font>

422
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:11,398
<font color="yellow">You little... Hold on.</font>

423
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,798
<font color="yellow">Hang in there.</font>

424
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,228
<font color="yellow">It'll be over soon.</font>

425
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:16,428
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

426
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:20,028
<font color="yellow">I think you're a very good actor.</font>

427
00:24:20,758 --> 00:24:22,558
<font color="yellow">If we end up working together,</font>

428
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:24,998
<font color="yellow">I'll let you make the decisions.</font>

429
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:27,258
<font color="yellow">I'll be supporting you from behind.</font>

430
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:29,558
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

431
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:35,498
<font color="yellow">What do you not like about her?</font>

432
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,228
<font color="yellow">She's the complete opposite of Eun Gab. She won't force me.</font>

433
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,458
<font color="yellow">He didn't force you to do anything. He was trying to help.</font>

434
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:42,258
<font color="yellow">Let's not forget that.</font>

435
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,458
<font color="yellow">Why are you taking his side now? You two never even got along.</font>

436
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:50,328
<font color="yellow">Let's just sign the contract. We have to start working again.</font>

437
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:53,958
<font color="yellow">We should.</font>

438
00:24:56,058 --> 00:24:57,598
<font color="yellow">I don't even know anymore.</font>

439
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:35,728
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

440
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,328
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Hello.</font>

441
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,858
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim. It's me, Ho Jin.</font>

442
00:25:43,998 --> 00:25:45,598
<font color="yellow">What makes you call me?</font>

443
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,098
<font color="yellow">I was just...</font>

444
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,958
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering how you're doing.</font>

445
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,628
<font color="yellow">- Are you doing all right? - I am.</font>

446
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,298
<font color="yellow">We signed a couple of actors recently. We've been busy.</font>

447
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,528
<font color="yellow">- What about you? How's work? - You know.</font>

448
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:01,958
<font color="yellow">We don't have any work.</font>

449
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,258
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going around meeting other agencies.</font>

450
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:09,728
<font color="yellow">It's not like I was spying on you. I just heard some rumours.</font>

451
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,198
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim. Speaking of which...</font>

452
00:26:14,928 --> 00:26:16,098
<font color="yellow">What? You can say it.</font>

453
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:20,858
<font color="yellow">Will Ms. Jo be fine with us after we pay for the breach?</font>

454
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:25,698
<font color="yellow">I didn't notice anything particular about the news articles.</font>

455
00:26:27,198 --> 00:26:28,758
<font color="yellow">Did you do something about that?</font>

456
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:33,058
<font color="yellow">I did introduce her to a different actor, but I don't know how it went.</font>

457
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,658
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

458
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:42,428
<font color="yellow">I saw Joon on that show. What on earth was that?</font>

459
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:46,028
<font color="yellow">Joon's been stressed out because of that.</font>

460
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:48,428
<font color="yellow">He doesn't do anything right.</font>

461
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,928
<font color="yellow">It was his first time. I'm sure he'll get better.</font>

462
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:55,558
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim. By the way... - What is it?</font>

463
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,128
<font color="yellow">Never mind. I was just calling to check on you.</font>

464
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:06,158
<font color="yellow">Okay. Send Joon my regards.</font>

465
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,028
<font color="yellow">- Okay. I'll hang up now. - Goodbye.</font>

466
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:22,528
<font color="yellow">Come down and eat, Turtle.</font>

467
00:27:23,728 --> 00:27:26,828
<font color="yellow">He doesn't seem to care about my being sick at all.</font>

468
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,428
<font color="yellow">I don't want to go to work today.</font>

469
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:29,998
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

470
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:33,398
<font color="yellow">I talked with Mr. Kim and he said he watched the show.</font>

471
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:35,598
<font color="yellow">- He sends his regards. - Really?</font>

472
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:37,328
<font color="yellow">So he did know.</font>

473
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,828
<font color="yellow">Why did you talk to him? Did Eun Gab call you?</font>

474
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:42,928
<font color="yellow">I called him.</font>

475
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,058
<font color="yellow">We didn't talk about you. Don't worry.</font>

476
00:27:46,928 --> 00:27:48,998
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of joining the agency we met yesterday.</font>

477
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:50,898
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

478
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,598
<font color="yellow">- Do I have to call you down twice? - Stop.</font>

479
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:58,198
<font color="yellow">Did you see the news?</font>

480
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,728
<font color="yellow">That agency you met yesterday is involved in a stock manipulation.</font>

481
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:01,828
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

482
00:28:04,628 --> 00:28:07,228
<font color="yellow">("An Agency's CEO Summoned to the Prosecution")</font>

483
00:28:10,658 --> 00:28:12,098
<font color="yellow">Do we have to look for somewhere else now?</font>

484
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:18,328
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji An.</font>

485
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:24,358
<font color="yellow">These are some fancy clothes.</font>

486
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:28,698
<font color="yellow">Are you nervous already?</font>

487
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,458
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's my first time meeting her after we started dating.</font>

488
00:28:35,328 --> 00:28:36,498
<font color="yellow">Why are we shopping for clothes all of a sudden?</font>

489
00:28:37,198 --> 00:28:39,898
<font color="yellow">It is Young Bin's meeting after all,</font>

490
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:41,428
<font color="yellow">but I want you to look nice in front of her.</font>

491
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:50,658
<font color="yellow">How's this one?</font>

492
00:28:50,658 --> 00:28:53,328
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang now knows that we're dating, right?</font>

493
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:55,258
<font color="yellow">What do you think she'll say?</font>

494
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:58,698
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. She always thought highly of you.</font>

495
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:00,698
<font color="yellow">Try this on.</font>

496
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:04,298
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to come with you?</font>

497
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:08,428
<font color="yellow">In there?</font>

498
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:11,628
<font color="yellow">No. To the meeting.</font>

499
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:14,628
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

500
00:29:16,098 --> 00:29:17,458
<font color="yellow">I can get changed by myself.</font>

501
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:31,898
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

502
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:33,498
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

503
00:29:34,198 --> 00:29:35,628
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

504
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:37,858
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

505
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:39,298
<font color="yellow">- You're here. - Hello.</font>

506
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:42,598
<font color="yellow">After that, we should go with this.</font>

507
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,858
<font color="yellow">The viewers didn't like me that much, did they? I'm sorry.</font>

508
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:47,458
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be.</font>

509
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:49,628
<font color="yellow">It was just the pilot episode. We'll have to see how it goes.</font>

510
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,958
<font color="yellow">No. I should've done better.</font>

511
00:29:54,598 --> 00:29:57,558
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll explain the concept of today's shooting. Take a seat.</font>

512
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,958
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

513
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,258
<font color="yellow">After that, we should...</font>

514
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,328
<font color="yellow">Are you sick somewhere?</font>

515
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:06,258
<font color="yellow">We need you to be very active today.</font>

516
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,228
<font color="yellow">I'm not sick at all.</font>

517
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,458
<font color="yellow">Why... Why would I be?</font>

518
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:16,598
<font color="yellow">What's today's shooting about?</font>

519
00:30:16,598 --> 00:30:19,328
<font color="yellow">I heard it's about looking after horses.</font>

520
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:20,998
<font color="yellow">No, you'll be riding them.</font>

521
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,258
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

522
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:26,058
<font color="yellow">I have to ride horses?</font>

523
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,728
<font color="yellow">That sounds like so much fun.</font>

524
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,028
<font color="yellow">I get to ride horses today.</font>

525
00:31:10,598 --> 00:31:12,158
<font color="yellow">Hang on a minute, Joon.</font>

526
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:17,428
<font color="yellow">Your face is too erotic. You look like you could be in an adult film.</font>

527
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,158
<font color="yellow">It's not that I'm feeling anything.</font>

528
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,058
<font color="yellow">- Can I take a short break? - Again?</font>

529
00:31:27,798 --> 00:31:30,758
<font color="yellow">I think I need to go to the bathroom.</font>

530
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:33,258
<font color="yellow">- Make it quick. - Okay.</font>

531
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,128
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

532
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:03,058
<font color="yellow">Are you all right? I'm worried you might be impotent after this.</font>

533
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,298
<font color="yellow">I can't ride any longer.</font>

534
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:07,358
<font color="yellow">I can't even begin to express the pain I'm in.</font>

535
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,698
<font color="yellow">It feels like watermelons are coming out of my you-know-where.</font>

536
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,558
<font color="yellow">You should just tell them.</font>

537
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:16,698
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see how many female staff members there are? No way.</font>

538
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:20,128
<font color="yellow">I can't leave a worse impression than I already have.</font>

539
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,898
<font color="yellow">Some timing this is.</font>

540
00:32:22,028 --> 00:32:23,028
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

541
00:32:23,828 --> 00:32:26,228
<font color="yellow">Isn't there any other excuse I can come up with?</font>

542
00:32:28,368 --> 00:32:32,558
<font color="yellow">Tell them you fell from a horse when you went out hunting as a kid.</font>

543
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,868
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is some time of western development?</font>

544
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:38,198
<font color="yellow">You do have a face of our earliest pioneers.</font>

545
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:41,258
<font color="yellow">Can you look up if there are any phobias related to horses?</font>

546
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,098
<font color="yellow">Some people could be allergic to horses.</font>

547
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:45,868
<font color="yellow">How can someone with a horse face be scared of horses?</font>

548
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:47,528
<font color="yellow">Stop messing around with me.</font>

549
00:32:48,528 --> 00:32:50,298
<font color="yellow">My private part is at stake here.</font>

550
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:52,628
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to live the rest of my life as an eunuch?</font>

551
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:55,758
<font color="yellow">So tell the producers the truth that your private part hurts.</font>

552
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,658
<font color="yellow">I can't. Never.</font>

553
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,228
<font color="yellow">Are you embarrassed?</font>

554
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:02,028
<font color="yellow">It's just another body part that is hurting.</font>

555
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,958
<font color="yellow">Which happens to be my private part!</font>

556
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,058
<font color="yellow">It's my only weakness.</font>

557
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:10,258
<font color="yellow">Every part of your body is a weakness. You're just weak.</font>

558
00:33:14,728 --> 00:33:15,998
<font color="yellow">It's hurting again.</font>

559
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,698
<font color="yellow">I really tried to show them what I'm capable of this time.</font>

560
00:33:22,228 --> 00:33:24,628
<font color="yellow">Why did they have to make me ride horses today?</font>

561
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:28,998
<font color="yellow">Darn my prostate!</font>

562
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,768
<font color="yellow">Curse you, my prostate!</font>

563
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:33,958
<font color="yellow">Curse you!</font>

564
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:38,858
<font color="yellow">- I have to go now, right? - Yes.</font>

565
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,768
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

566
00:33:42,698 --> 00:33:45,328
<font color="yellow">- I think it's bleeding. - It's not. Come on.</font>

567
00:33:55,398 --> 00:33:56,398
<font color="yellow">Can I talk to you for a minute?</font>

568
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,598
<font color="yellow">I have something to say to the staff members.</font>

569
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:03,598
<font color="yellow">When I was young,</font>

570
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:05,758
<font color="yellow">I was eating a carrot in front of a horse...</font>

571
00:34:05,858 --> 00:34:09,598
<font color="yellow">and the horse took it away from me. I'm traumatized.</font>

572
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:10,758
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

573
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:13,858
<font color="yellow">And ever since then,</font>

574
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:18,098
<font color="yellow">I've been scared of horses.</font>

575
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,598
<font color="yellow">I have equinophobia.</font>

576
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:23,558
<font color="yellow">It's because of...</font>

577
00:34:24,998 --> 00:34:26,228
<font color="yellow">your prostate.</font>

578
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:28,758
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

579
00:34:29,028 --> 00:34:31,128
<font color="yellow">We heard you mentioning your private part.</font>

580
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,668
<font color="yellow">That was hilarious.</font>

581
00:34:34,728 --> 00:34:38,258
<font color="yellow">You should take the mic off next time you go get changed.</font>

582
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:41,998
<font color="yellow">I left it on?</font>

583
00:34:46,098 --> 00:34:47,728
<font color="yellow">You heard everything?</font>

584
00:34:47,928 --> 00:34:50,098
<font color="yellow">Everyone here heard it all.</font>

585
00:34:55,258 --> 00:34:56,258
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

586
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:07,598
<font color="yellow">Am I making you uncomfortable again?</font>

587
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,228
<font color="yellow">Not at all. I feel at home.</font>

588
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:11,098
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

589
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,028
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

590
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,358
<font color="yellow">Actors can't have a single drink with peace when they're outside.</font>

591
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:23,598
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

592
00:35:24,428 --> 00:35:26,528
<font color="yellow">Did you find an agency you like?</font>

593
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,598
<font color="yellow">No. Not yet.</font>

594
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:31,398
<font color="yellow">That's good to hear.</font>

595
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:34,528
<font color="yellow">You know why I wanted to see you today, right?</font>

596
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:39,528
<font color="yellow">I want you to be a part of my agency again.</font>

597
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:41,198
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

598
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,458
<font color="yellow">Why look somewhere else?</font>

599
00:35:45,928 --> 00:35:47,558
<font color="yellow">This is where you used to belong.</font>

600
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:51,828
<font color="yellow">We know you the best and treat you the best.</font>

601
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:54,228
<font color="yellow">I'll think about your offer.</font>

602
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:57,528
<font color="yellow">How about you, Manager Lee?</font>

603
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,058
<font color="yellow">I agree with him.</font>

604
00:36:00,328 --> 00:36:02,458
<font color="yellow">You're not very talkative today.</font>

605
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,298
<font color="yellow">Empty your glass.</font>

606
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:09,328
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

607
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:12,728
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

608
00:36:17,428 --> 00:36:19,958
<font color="yellow">Oh, I noticed that your birthday is coming up.</font>

609
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:22,228
<font color="yellow">I'll personally throw you a birthday party this year.</font>

610
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:25,298
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We decided not to party this year.</font>

611
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:29,358
<font color="yellow">Why not? You've had it rough lately.</font>

612
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:31,598
<font color="yellow">You broke up with many friends.</font>

613
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,928
<font color="yellow">You should enjoy the time to get back on your feet.</font>

614
00:36:36,998 --> 00:36:38,698
<font color="yellow">You and me both.</font>

615
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:42,328
<font color="yellow">We both parted ways with someone we worked with for a long time.</font>

616
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,228
<font color="yellow">- Are you talking about Eun Gab? - Yes.</font>

617
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:49,228
<font color="yellow">Things aren't the way it used to be after he left.</font>

618
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:53,628
<font color="yellow">But we did have our differences.</font>

619
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,758
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't let our attachments stop us from making decisions.</font>

620
00:36:58,168 --> 00:36:59,168
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

621
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,828
<font color="yellow">I need to go to the bathroom quickly.</font>

622
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:15,928
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

623
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:31,458
<font color="yellow">Ji An is running late on purpose so we could talk.</font>

624
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:33,858
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

625
00:37:35,298 --> 00:37:36,358
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

626
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,528
<font color="yellow">How far are you willing to go...</font>

627
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,228
<font color="yellow">with my daughter?</font>

628
00:37:43,498 --> 00:37:44,498
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry?</font>

629
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:46,928
<font color="yellow">Don't act surprised.</font>

630
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,928
<font color="yellow">Working as a manager can be demanding.</font>

631
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:53,998
<font color="yellow">Are you going to marry her?</font>

632
00:37:55,228 --> 00:37:56,228
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

633
00:37:57,198 --> 00:38:00,558
<font color="yellow">I haven't thought that far.</font>

634
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,628
<font color="yellow">But you should.</font>

635
00:38:03,858 --> 00:38:05,058
<font color="yellow">My daughter...</font>

636
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:08,428
<font color="yellow">had a lonely life growing up because of me.</font>

637
00:38:08,998 --> 00:38:11,358
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

638
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:14,698
<font color="yellow">I don't want her boyfriend to be a manager.</font>

639
00:38:15,898 --> 00:38:17,928
<font color="yellow">- I'll work on that. - Okay.</font>

640
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,258
<font color="yellow">I'll...</font>

641
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:24,498
<font color="yellow">keep my eyes on you, Manager Lee.</font>

642
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:27,898
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Pour me a glass.</font>

643
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:37,528
<font color="yellow">Drink that up.</font>

644
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:39,328
<font color="yellow">- What? - Bottoms up.</font>

645
00:38:39,998 --> 00:38:43,398
<font color="yellow">I want to see how you are when you get drunk.</font>

646
00:38:44,428 --> 00:38:45,428
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

647
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:06,758
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

648
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:11,698
<font color="yellow">I called for a designated driver. Drink this.</font>

649
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:22,798
<font color="yellow">I'm probably the first actor to look after a drunk manager.</font>

650
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:24,798
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm going to die.</font>

651
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,958
<font color="yellow">I had to use all of my willpower.</font>

652
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:32,098
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang really tested your limits.</font>

653
00:39:32,858 --> 00:39:35,298
<font color="yellow">How should I say this? She looked like your mother-in-law.</font>

654
00:39:38,528 --> 00:39:41,058
<font color="yellow">- Did I do anything wrong? - No, you didn't.</font>

655
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:44,528
<font color="yellow">What did you think...</font>

656
00:39:45,828 --> 00:39:46,928
<font color="yellow">about Ms. Kang's offer?</font>

657
00:39:48,198 --> 00:39:49,258
<font color="yellow">It didn't sound bad, did it?</font>

658
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:53,398
<font color="yellow">It sounded good. The terms are nice, too.</font>

659
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:56,358
<font color="yellow">Also, we can trust them more than other companies.</font>

660
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:00,898
<font color="yellow">- Still... - Eun Gab?</font>

661
00:40:03,598 --> 00:40:05,098
<font color="yellow">It bothers me, too.</font>

662
00:40:07,798 --> 00:40:10,168
<font color="yellow">Do you care about him?</font>

663
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:11,898
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

664
00:40:12,898 --> 00:40:14,258
<font color="yellow">I thought you were still angry with him.</font>

665
00:40:15,168 --> 00:40:16,958
<font color="yellow">He's a nice person.</font>

666
00:40:18,058 --> 00:40:20,498
<font color="yellow">You'll probably tell me to stop, but I don't want to.</font>

667
00:40:21,858 --> 00:40:24,358
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you just... - Stop.</font>

668
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:28,228
<font color="yellow">Let's just sign the contract. You should start working again.</font>

669
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:39,198
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han, come here. Why are you so late?</font>

670
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:42,168
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?</font>

671
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,728
<font color="yellow">I got Lasik surgery.</font>

672
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:46,598
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep at all last night.</font>

673
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:50,228
<font color="yellow">It hurt so much.</font>

674
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,028
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm late. I'm sorry.</font>

675
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:54,628
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you meet Kang Eun Sol?</font>

676
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:56,628
<font color="yellow">I can't meet anyone right now because of my eyes.</font>

677
00:40:56,828 --> 00:40:58,458
<font color="yellow">I can't even look at my phone screen.</font>

678
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:01,358
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to get the surgery at this critical time?</font>

679
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,228
<font color="yellow">Since I got divorced,</font>

680
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:07,558
<font color="yellow">I've been feeling empty.</font>

681
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:08,828
<font color="yellow">Are you crying?</font>

682
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:12,298
<font color="yellow">My eyes hurt so much. They're supposed to be okay by now.</font>

683
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:14,168
<font color="yellow">It's driving me crazy.</font>

684
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:16,798
<font color="yellow">Did you have breakfast?</font>

685
00:41:18,458 --> 00:41:21,528
<font color="yellow">Breakfast? I don't have an appetite.</font>

686
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:24,228
<font color="yellow">I'll meet Kang Eun Sol soon.</font>

687
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:27,398
<font color="yellow">Eat well. I trust you'll finish your tasks.</font>

688
00:41:27,998 --> 00:41:30,128
<font color="yellow">- Go in. - I'm sorry.</font>

689
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:33,828
<font color="yellow">Still, coming to work at 11am is...</font>

690
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,728
<font color="yellow">You're acting really strange.</font>

691
00:41:38,758 --> 00:41:40,028
<font color="yellow">Why are you suddenly so nice?</font>

692
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:42,498
<font color="yellow">I couldn't say anything to someone sick.</font>

693
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,798
<font color="yellow">Isn't there a saying like this?</font>

694
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:47,528
<font color="yellow">"If you change too fast, you might die soon." Right?</font>

695
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:49,298
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

696
00:41:49,728 --> 00:41:51,598
<font color="yellow">Stop the nonsense.</font>

697
00:41:56,258 --> 00:41:57,898
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ms. Jo. What's the matter?</font>

698
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:00,598
<font color="yellow">Are you eating something again?</font>

699
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,798
<font color="yellow">It sounds like you're chewing something.</font>

700
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:06,528
<font color="yellow">You're eating something every time we talk on the phone.</font>

701
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,158
<font color="yellow">I'm not eating anything.</font>

702
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:10,228
<font color="yellow">Fine. What's the matter?</font>

703
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,128
<font color="yellow">I made a contract with Mr. Lim today.</font>

704
00:42:13,228 --> 00:42:14,598
<font color="yellow">We decided on the actor, too.</font>

705
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:18,098
<font color="yellow">That's great. You have nothing to do with Young Bin now.</font>

706
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:21,598
<font color="yellow">No. I'll never work with him again.</font>

707
00:42:22,398 --> 00:42:24,958
<font color="yellow">But you know how things work here. I'll end up working with him again.</font>

708
00:42:25,598 --> 00:42:27,628
<font color="yellow">Next time, I won't let him get away.</font>

709
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,528
<font color="yellow">All right. Now, you can go ahead with your plans.</font>

710
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,798
<font color="yellow">I can't. Another work is giving me a headache now.</font>

711
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:37,898
<font color="yellow">It's a movie Young Bin was interested in again.</font>

712
00:42:38,028 --> 00:42:40,058
<font color="yellow">Do you mean "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

713
00:42:40,428 --> 00:42:43,158
<font color="yellow">Yes. I don't know what's with Young Bin.</font>

714
00:42:43,158 --> 00:42:45,298
<font color="yellow">Why do you blame him?</font>

715
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:48,558
<font color="yellow">Do you feel bad? He doesn't work with you anymore.</font>

716
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:53,058
<font color="yellow">Right. Young Bin is going back to Ok and Gab Entertainment.</font>

717
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:55,658
<font color="yellow">You must feel bitter.</font>

718
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:59,128
<font color="yellow">I was expecting it.</font>

719
00:43:01,098 --> 00:43:02,158
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

720
00:43:06,128 --> 00:43:09,598
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why did he choose them of all agencies?</font>

721
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:19,958
<font color="yellow">What's all that?</font>

722
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,758
<font color="yellow">It's our birthday present for Young Bin.</font>

723
00:43:23,128 --> 00:43:24,558
<font color="yellow">It finally arrived on the day before his birthday.</font>

724
00:43:24,858 --> 00:43:26,158
<font color="yellow">It's a beer-brewing machine.</font>

725
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:30,528
<font color="yellow">It's his birthday. Why did you buy a present for yourselves?</font>

726
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:32,528
<font color="yellow">We can all share the beer.</font>

727
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,298
<font color="yellow">Young Bin said he was okay with it.</font>

728
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,128
<font color="yellow">I told them to buy it. Let's make beer for tomorrow.</font>

729
00:43:38,858 --> 00:43:42,128
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you making a contract with Ms. Kang?</font>

730
00:43:43,128 --> 00:43:46,728
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about it. The terms are nice.</font>

731
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:49,098
<font color="yellow">Only if Ho Jin wasn't against it.</font>

732
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:51,198
<font color="yellow">I'm not against it.</font>

733
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,328
<font color="yellow">You didn't like the other companies.</font>

734
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:54,498
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

735
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,428
<font color="yellow">Are you taking your mother-in-law's side now?</font>

736
00:43:58,128 --> 00:44:00,128
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is abandoning Mr. Kim.</font>

737
00:44:00,128 --> 00:44:01,158
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

738
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:02,728
<font color="yellow">He'll feel hurt if you make a contract with her.</font>

739
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:05,428
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he already knows. This field is small.</font>

740
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,958
<font color="yellow">I guess he'll feel hurt.</font>

741
00:44:09,928 --> 00:44:11,728
<font color="yellow">When is your show airing?</font>

742
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:16,228
<font color="yellow">It's starting to hurt again.</font>

743
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:18,898
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to watch that show.</font>

744
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:22,758
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine after the editing.</font>

745
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:24,058
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

746
00:44:24,598 --> 00:44:28,528
<font color="yellow">Should we tell Mr. Kim before we sign the contract?</font>

747
00:44:30,358 --> 00:44:31,358
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

748
00:44:32,428 --> 00:44:33,528
<font color="yellow">You can tell him.</font>

749
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:40,958
<font color="yellow">How can he do this? Why did they choose Ms. Kang?</font>

750
00:44:41,098 --> 00:44:43,828
<font color="yellow">They know what she did to me.</font>

751
00:44:44,228 --> 00:44:46,128
<font color="yellow">It feels like they betrayed me twice.</font>

752
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:49,858
<font color="yellow">There must be countless agencies that want Young Bin.</font>

753
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:51,658
<font color="yellow">Ok and Gab is not that competent, either.</font>

754
00:44:51,758 --> 00:44:53,428
<font color="yellow">Wait. They don't need "Gab" in their name anymore.</font>

755
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:55,028
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

756
00:44:55,628 --> 00:44:57,628
<font color="yellow">You've been only talking about Young Bin.</font>

757
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:00,328
<font color="yellow">Why do you care whom he chooses? Do you feel jealous?</font>

758
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,198
<font color="yellow">I'm not jealous. Ms. Kang is pulling my leg.</font>

759
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:05,558
<font color="yellow">I can totally picture her smiling ear to ear.</font>

760
00:45:05,928 --> 00:45:08,228
<font color="yellow">- You're obsessed. - No, I'm not.</font>

761
00:45:08,328 --> 00:45:09,558
<font color="yellow">Then what's the problem?</font>

762
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:11,628
<font color="yellow">Everything's over. Get over it.</font>

763
00:45:13,258 --> 00:45:15,758
<font color="yellow">Let's see the pastor once more. When is good for you?</font>

764
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:20,158
<font color="yellow">It's so sticky here. I'll get the mop.</font>

765
00:45:21,398 --> 00:45:23,358
<font color="yellow">I can't predict what will happen.</font>

766
00:45:23,598 --> 00:45:24,858
<font color="yellow">That's what this show is all about.</font>

767
00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:27,128
<font color="yellow">This show is supposed to be a reality show,</font>

768
00:45:27,228 --> 00:45:29,858
<font color="yellow">but it just tortures people.</font>

769
00:45:30,698 --> 00:45:33,128
<font color="yellow">No one tells them what's happening.</font>

770
00:45:33,198 --> 00:45:35,358
<font color="yellow">I have no idea how it'll wind up.</font>

771
00:45:35,998 --> 00:45:37,428
<font color="yellow">All right. Now...</font>

772
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:39,998
<font color="yellow">I've never been this serious about a show.</font>

773
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:43,498
<font color="yellow">The show has been going on for 30 minutes, and he hasn't appeared.</font>

774
00:45:43,898 --> 00:45:45,528
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll appear soon.</font>

775
00:45:46,098 --> 00:45:47,328
<font color="yellow">I'll go out for a while.</font>

776
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:50,228
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

777
00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:52,228
<font color="yellow">Do you need some air in your pants?</font>

778
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:58,298
<font color="yellow">(Turtle)</font>

779
00:46:49,028 --> 00:46:52,028
<font color="yellow">I'm actor Cha Joon!</font>

780
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:54,028
<font color="yellow">Come on, waves!</font>

781
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:56,798
<font color="yellow">Come on, wind!</font>

782
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,128
<font color="yellow">I'll never give in.</font>

783
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:04,528
<font color="yellow">I'm Cha Joon!</font>

784
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:08,128
<font color="yellow">Can you be quiet?</font>

785
00:47:08,728 --> 00:47:10,658
<font color="yellow">You're distracting us.</font>

786
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:12,198
<font color="yellow">There are other people here.</font>

787
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:14,098
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

788
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,228
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Gosh, it's so annoying.</font>

789
00:47:17,398 --> 00:47:18,558
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

790
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:59,498
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this hour? Do you know what time it is?</font>

791
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:00,628
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

792
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:04,228
<font color="yellow">I was all alone at home, and I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

793
00:48:04,328 --> 00:48:05,758
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can sleep well?</font>

794
00:48:06,328 --> 00:48:10,158
<font color="yellow">I was finally falling asleep after taking pills.</font>

795
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:11,358
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

796
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:15,528
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm here, can't we have a little talk?</font>

797
00:48:16,328 --> 00:48:17,628
<font color="yellow">What's that? Take that off.</font>

798
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:20,898
<font color="yellow">Let's talk.</font>

799
00:48:23,728 --> 00:48:24,728
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

800
00:48:40,298 --> 00:48:41,428
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

801
00:48:44,328 --> 00:48:45,328
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

802
00:48:46,158 --> 00:48:48,428
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? You have to drive.</font>

803
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:50,528
<font color="yellow">I can call a designated driver.</font>

804
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,998
<font color="yellow">I can't go on without alcohol.</font>

805
00:48:59,428 --> 00:49:00,858
<font color="yellow">After the divorce,</font>

806
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:04,028
<font color="yellow">I started to miss my wife.</font>

807
00:49:04,228 --> 00:49:06,628
<font color="yellow">I feel so empty and in pain.</font>

808
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:11,898
<font color="yellow">It feels like I lost an organ.</font>

809
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:13,728
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

810
00:49:14,758 --> 00:49:17,328
<font color="yellow">I can imagine how you'd feel. Why did you get divorced?</font>

811
00:49:17,428 --> 00:49:18,698
<font color="yellow">It was my fault.</font>

812
00:49:20,428 --> 00:49:22,028
<font color="yellow">My wife doesn't let me meet my kid.</font>

813
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:24,728
<font color="yellow">You can't meet your kid?</font>

814
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:29,028
<font color="yellow">Go beg her right now.</font>

815
00:49:29,698 --> 00:49:31,358
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen my kid in a month.</font>

816
00:49:32,158 --> 00:49:33,498
<font color="yellow">I miss my kid so much.</font>

817
00:49:34,328 --> 00:49:35,328
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

818
00:49:38,328 --> 00:49:41,758
<font color="yellow">It feels like my kid is still in her room.</font>

819
00:49:44,428 --> 00:49:46,428
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

820
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,258
<font color="yellow">I have no one else to talk to. I'm sorry.</font>

821
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:55,198
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

822
00:49:56,228 --> 00:49:57,698
<font color="yellow">You can't meet your kid?</font>

823
00:50:03,298 --> 00:50:04,558
<font color="yellow">Are you crying...</font>

824
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:05,898
<font color="yellow">because of me?</font>

825
00:50:06,328 --> 00:50:07,358
<font color="yellow">You can't meet your...</font>

826
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:12,798
<font color="yellow">Gosh, something's wrong with me.</font>

827
00:50:12,858 --> 00:50:14,958
<font color="yellow">You go home, okay?</font>

828
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:17,898
<font color="yellow">Do call a driver. Gosh.</font>

829
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:19,198
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

830
00:50:19,328 --> 00:50:21,158
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

831
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:32,728
<font color="yellow">Pastor.</font>

832
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:34,228
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

833
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:35,998
<font color="yellow">Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.</font>

834
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:39,758
<font color="yellow">What's the matter in the middle of the night?</font>

835
00:50:39,928 --> 00:50:42,328
<font color="yellow">You were right. I'm depressed.</font>

836
00:50:43,028 --> 00:50:44,028
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

837
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:46,928
<font color="yellow">Is that it?</font>

838
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,728
<font color="yellow">I thought something happened.</font>

839
00:50:49,228 --> 00:50:52,058
<font color="yellow">It's late now. You should go home.</font>

840
00:50:52,198 --> 00:50:53,698
<font color="yellow">Meet me at the church tomorrow.</font>

841
00:50:53,828 --> 00:50:54,828
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

842
00:50:55,758 --> 00:50:57,228
<font color="yellow">This is important for me.</font>

843
00:50:57,428 --> 00:51:00,098
<font color="yellow">I was crying just a moment ago. Do you see it?</font>

844
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:04,258
<font color="yellow">As my wife said, I think it started when my actor left me.</font>

845
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:06,898
<font color="yellow">Whenever I hear about people breaking up,</font>

846
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:08,758
<font color="yellow">I burst into tears.</font>

847
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,628
<font color="yellow">I have a new employee who is terrible at his job.</font>

848
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,158
<font color="yellow">He came by in the middle of the night...</font>

849
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:17,428
<font color="yellow">and whined about his divorce. I couldn't say anything to him.</font>

850
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:18,858
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

851
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:21,858
<font color="yellow">Is that a problem?</font>

852
00:51:21,928 --> 00:51:26,498
<font color="yellow">Before, I'd insult and fire someone like him right away.</font>

853
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:29,498
<font color="yellow">Insulting and offending others used to be my joy.</font>

854
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:32,628
<font color="yellow">This is not the real me.</font>

855
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:34,328
<font color="yellow">To me, it seems like...</font>

856
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,828
<font color="yellow">you changed for the better. You're less aggressive now.</font>

857
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,028
<font color="yellow">I want to go back to the old me.</font>

858
00:51:40,428 --> 00:51:42,228
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

859
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:46,328
<font color="yellow">I don't think you're just depressed.</font>

860
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,928
<font color="yellow">Did anything special happen recently?</font>

861
00:51:50,028 --> 00:51:52,598
<font color="yellow">The thing is,</font>

862
00:51:52,698 --> 00:51:56,528
<font color="yellow">my close friends left me recently.</font>

863
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:59,628
<font color="yellow">I did my best, but I apparently hurt them.</font>

864
00:51:59,698 --> 00:52:02,128
<font color="yellow">After that, I can't act as I wish...</font>

865
00:52:02,198 --> 00:52:05,128
<font color="yellow">because I'm scared people will leave me again.</font>

866
00:52:07,658 --> 00:52:09,058
<font color="yellow">- Are you falling asleep? - Sorry.</font>

867
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:11,498
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty tired.</font>

868
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:14,098
<font color="yellow">Do you have any idea what time it is?</font>

869
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:18,698
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about something crucial for me. How can you...</font>

870
00:52:19,398 --> 00:52:21,998
<font color="yellow">A lost sheep is looking for water.</font>

871
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:25,098
<font color="yellow">A shepherd can't fall asleep now.</font>

872
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,858
<font color="yellow">I donated so much money to your church.</font>

873
00:52:26,928 --> 00:52:29,358
<font color="yellow">It's just so late.</font>

874
00:52:29,558 --> 00:52:31,158
<font color="yellow">Can't a pastor sleep?</font>

875
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:33,398
<font color="yellow">It's two in the morning now.</font>

876
00:52:33,928 --> 00:52:36,058
<font color="yellow">It is late. My point is...</font>

877
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:39,628
<font color="yellow">Just do what you want. Go back to your old self.</font>

878
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:41,358
<font color="yellow">Get back what you've lost.</font>

879
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:45,598
<font color="yellow">That will cure your depression. My goodness.</font>

880
00:52:46,098 --> 00:52:47,158
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

881
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:51,498
<font color="yellow">Do not skip Sunday services, okay?</font>

882
00:52:51,998 --> 00:52:53,598
<font color="yellow">- Hallelujah. - Amen.</font>

883
00:52:53,928 --> 00:52:55,758
<font color="yellow">- Go home now. - Okay.</font>

884
00:52:56,498 --> 00:52:59,598
<font color="yellow">Why did he have to come in the middle of the night?</font>

885
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:05,758
<font color="yellow">My old self?</font>

886
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:09,828
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

887
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:13,728
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

888
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,628
<font color="yellow">Your voice drives me crazy.</font>

889
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,028
<font color="yellow">Kiss me.</font>

890
00:53:20,528 --> 00:53:21,628
<font color="yellow">Kiss me right now.</font>

891
00:53:22,628 --> 00:53:23,658
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

892
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:25,728
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

893
00:53:26,228 --> 00:53:27,898
<font color="yellow">Was it your kid on the phone?</font>

894
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:30,828
<font color="yellow">No, it wasn't.</font>

895
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:33,428
<font color="yellow">Are you seeing someone?</font>

896
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:37,598
<font color="yellow">Did you get divorced because you had an affair?</font>

897
00:53:39,328 --> 00:53:40,398
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

898
00:53:41,058 --> 00:53:44,498
<font color="yellow">never going to meet her again,</font>

899
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,798
<font color="yellow">but my wife didn't trust me.</font>

900
00:53:47,698 --> 00:53:51,228
<font color="yellow">I'm a human being. I've been lonely.</font>

901
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,828
<font color="yellow">You've known me for a long time. I'm not a bad guy.</font>

902
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:55,158
<font color="yellow">Cut it out.</font>

903
00:53:55,758 --> 00:53:57,458
<font color="yellow">Have you met Kang Eun Sol?</font>

904
00:53:57,758 --> 00:53:59,458
<font color="yellow">Not yet. My eyes are...</font>

905
00:54:01,028 --> 00:54:03,158
<font color="yellow">When my eyes recover...</font>

906
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:04,458
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

907
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,098
<font color="yellow">You finished the puzzle.</font>

908
00:54:15,928 --> 00:54:19,228
<font color="yellow">I did it last night.</font>

909
00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:21,698
<font color="yellow">It looks quite nice, doesn't it?</font>

910
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:25,698
<font color="yellow">- I bought something even better. - You brat.</font>

1059

1060
01:03:41,728 --> 01:03:44,558

<font color="yellow">- Shall we? - Can we?</font>

1063
01:03:48,998 --> 01:03:50,558
<font color="yellow">No one would notice even if I left.</font>

1064
01:03:54,158 --> 01:03:55,498
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Thanks.</font>

1065
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:05,798

1066

<font color="yellow">- Is it on you? - Sure.</font>

1067
01:04:07,498 --> 01:04:09,858
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you guys since I'm in a good mood today. I'll hail a cab.</font>

1068
01:04:14,128 --> 01:04:15,158
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

1069
01:04:16,158 --> 01:04:17,958
<font color="yellow">Shall I sign the contract with Ms. Kang?</font>

1070
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:22,928
<font color="yellow">I must say, it is better than other agencies.</font>

1071
01:04:23,658 --> 01:04:25,398
<font color="yellow">But I don't know how Mr. Kim will feel about it.</font>

1072
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:31,028
<font color="yellow">By the way, I haven't heard anything from Eun Gab.</font>

1073
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:33,658
<font color="yellow">I thought he'd at least text me to wish me a happy birthday.</font>

1074
01:04:33,758 --> 01:04:35,658
<font color="yellow">You two had a fight. Of course, he wouldn't.</font>

1075
01:04:36,128 --> 01:04:38,328
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't text you either if I were him.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Eun Gab)</font>

1077
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:21,628
<font color="yellow">What? Who's calling?</font>

1078
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:23,798
<font color="yellow">It's Eun Gab.</font>

1079
01:05:29,098 --> 01:05:30,628
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Eun Gab. - Hey.</font>

1080
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:33,098
<font color="yellow">Young Bin.</font>

1081

1082
01:05:37,528 --> 01:05:39,328
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I am. - I see. Then...</font>

1083
01:05:40,128 --> 01:05:41,128
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

1084
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:45,198
<font color="yellow">Oh, really? Well...</font>

1085
01:05:46,428 --> 01:05:47,628
<font color="yellow">Can I see you quickly?</font>

1086
01:05:48,098 --> 01:05:50,198
<font color="yellow">Do you have time? It'll be quick.</font>

1087
01:05:51,498 --> 01:05:53,458
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll meet you there.</font>

1088
01:05:57,698 --> 01:06:00,028
<font color="yellow">Does he want to meet up now? What for?</font>

1089
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:02,528
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

1090
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:05,998
<font color="yellow">Restaurant Chun?</font>

1091
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:09,828

1092
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,998
<font color="yellow">- Is the owner Chun Li? - Stop talking nonsense.</font>

1093
01:06:12,328 --> 01:06:13,398
<font color="yellow">It's possible.</font>

1095
01:06:20,028 --> 01:06:22,198

1096
01:06:24,028 --> 01:06:26,028
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

1097
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:27,598
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

1098
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,758
<font color="yellow">It's your birthday today. You should eat seaweed soup. Have a seat.</font>

1099
01:06:30,858 --> 01:06:31,858
<font color="yellow">Have a seat here.</font>

1100
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:36,628
<font color="yellow">They're here. Please heat up the soup.</font>

1101
01:06:36,898 --> 01:06:38,128
<font color="yellow">Okay. Right away.</font>

1102
01:06:40,028 --> 01:06:43,098
<font color="yellow">My friend owns this restaurant. The food here is so good.</font>

1103

<font color="yellow">You've never been here before? I guess you haven't... There it is.</font>

1104
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:46,858
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - This is my friend.</font>

1105
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:49,558
<font color="yellow">You don't need to get up. Just take the soup. Sit down.</font>

1106
01:06:50,828 --> 01:06:52,258
<font color="yellow">I don't see any customers.</font>

1107
01:06:52,328 --> 01:06:54,498
<font color="yellow">I rented the entire restaurant because of Young Bin.</font>

1108
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:57,998
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

1109
01:06:59,258 --> 01:07:00,258
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

1110
01:07:00,728 --> 01:07:02,998
<font color="yellow">Before we start eating...</font>

1111
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,728

1115
01:07:23,158 --> 01:07:24,728
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's eat now, guys.</font>

1116
01:07:24,728 --> 01:07:25,998
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for this. - It looks amazing.</font>

1117
01:07:27,028 --> 01:07:28,758
<font color="yellow">You must be sick of seaweed soup.</font>

1118
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:30,698
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't had it today.</font>

1119
01:07:30,928 --> 01:07:32,928
<font color="yellow">Really? Joon, you didn't make it for him?</font>

1120
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,028
<font color="yellow">No, I was a little busy today.</font>

1121
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,028
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1122
01:07:37,528 --> 01:07:39,828
<font color="yellow">Oh, right. I watched the show. You were hilarious in it.</font>

1123
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:41,798
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, you saw it? - You fool.</font>

1124
01:07:41,898 --> 01:07:44,358
<font color="yellow">Who knew he'd crack jokes about his prostate?</font>

1125
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,858
<font color="yellow">It was a blooper, wasn't it?</font>

1126
01:07:47,198 --> 01:07:49,498
<font color="yellow">No, it was all calculated.</font>

1127
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,598
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

1128
01:07:51,398 --> 01:07:54,468
<font color="yellow">Do you have time to eat? Don't you have to be at your birthday party?</font>

1129
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:57,358
<font color="yellow">We were actually just there. Ms. Kang threw a party for me.</font>

1130
01:07:57,858 --> 01:07:59,298
<font color="yellow">Oh, is that right?</font>

1131
01:08:02,968 --> 01:08:04,598
<font color="yellow">Why did you guys leave so early?</font>

1132
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:07,468
<font color="yellow">She got pretty drunk, so we sneaked out.</font>

1133
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:09,698
<font color="yellow">She's like that. She dances around, too.</font>

1134
01:08:10,158 --> 01:08:11,258
<font color="yellow">She's a piece of work.</font>

1135
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:13,898
<font color="yellow">So have you decided...</font>

1136
01:08:15,328 --> 01:08:16,798
<font color="yellow">to go back to Ok and Gab Entertainment?</font>

1137
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,298
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking I probably should. I haven't made up my mind, though.</font>

1138
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:24,058
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

1139
01:08:27,098 --> 01:08:28,358
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Eun Gab.</font>

1140
01:08:28,998 --> 01:08:30,858
<font color="yellow">It must hurt your feelings because it's Ms. Kang.</font>

1141
01:08:32,128 --> 01:08:35,128
<font color="yellow">Not at all. Work is work.</font>

1142
01:08:36,528 --> 01:08:38,928
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I feel bad about what happened with "War Terminator".</font>

1143
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:40,898
<font color="yellow">You don't need to apologize.</font>

1144
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:43,128
<font color="yellow">We just think differently.</font>

1145
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:46,858
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, let's do a good job even though we won't work together.</font>

1146
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:48,798
<font color="yellow">I really want all the best for you,</font>

1147
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,328
<font color="yellow">whether you work with me or not. I mean it.</font>

1148
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,198
<font color="yellow">I know. I feel the same way.</font>

1149
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,298
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

1150
01:08:57,098 --> 01:09:00,598
<font color="yellow">Guys, isn't it your job to lift up the mood?</font>

1151
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:03,498
<font color="yellow">- Right. - This soup is seriously so good.</font>

1152
01:09:03,558 --> 01:09:05,058
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's really delicious.</font>

1153
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:08,028
<font color="yellow">Your soup tastes like boiled seawater, but this is so flavourful.</font>

1154
01:09:08,128 --> 01:09:11,098
<font color="yellow">That's because I don't use flavour enhancers. He has bad taste.</font>

1155
01:09:11,098 --> 01:09:12,328
<font color="yellow">You have a bad face.</font>

1156
01:09:12,328 --> 01:09:14,898
<font color="yellow">Cut it out, guys. You guys are two peas in a pod.</font>

1157

<font color="yellow">You haven't decided on Young Bin's next film or drama, have you?</font>

1158
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:22,158
<font color="yellow">No, we should pick one soon.</font>

1159
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:25,198
<font color="yellow">I should give this to you before I forget.</font>

1171
