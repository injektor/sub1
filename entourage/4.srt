00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:24,171
<font color="yellow">Why are you working out so hard?</font>

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,511
<font color="yellow">I have nothing better to do.</font>

7
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,691
<font color="yellow">Now, I understand why you and
Young Bin work out so often.</font>

8
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:34,105
<font color="yellow">I guess you'll come here often now.</font>

9
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:35,945
<font color="yellow">Do they look cool to you?</font>

10
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:38,475
<font color="yellow">Big muscles make you look stupid.</font>

11
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,245
<font color="yellow">Who are you talking about?</font>

12
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:42,775
<font color="yellow">Those guys in the back.</font>

13
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,405
<font color="yellow">A slender yet toned body...</font>

14
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,245
<font color="yellow">is what makes girls go crazy.</font>

15
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,175
<font color="yellow">Look at my pubic bones.</font>

16
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,744
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- That's disgusting.</font>

17
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:57,845
<font color="yellow">I saw your hair.</font>

18
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:01,105
<font color="yellow">The problem is your face, not your body.</font>

19
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:02,745
<font color="yellow">He has a small bottom, too.</font>

20
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,175
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, you hobbits.</font>

21
00:01:04,245 --> 00:01:06,575
<font color="yellow">Stop envying me and save
the world by destroying the ring.</font>

22
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:08,505
<font color="yellow">That movie is so old.</font>

23
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:12,475
<font color="yellow">Why are you working out from
this early in the morning?</font>

24
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,475
<font color="yellow">How could he sleep?</font>

25
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:16,865
<font color="yellow">He saw director Lee Joon Ik
and Kim Soo Hyun together.</font>

26
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:18,505
<font color="yellow">I better work out.</font>

27
00:01:21,145 --> 00:01:22,175
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

28
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:24,405
<font color="yellow">I'll stay here a bit longer.</font>

29
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,245
<font color="yellow">Look at those muscles.</font>

30
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,475
<font color="yellow">As you said, your body is not everything...</font>

31
00:01:36,815 --> 00:01:37,905
<font color="yellow">when your face...</font>

32
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:40,815
<font color="yellow">He's Jin Goo.</font>

33
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:41,815
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

34
00:01:42,345 --> 00:01:44,075
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Young Bin.</font>

35
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:47,175
<font color="yellow">I heard you'll be in Director
Lee Joon Ik's movie.</font>

36
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:49,975
<font color="yellow">It's not decided yet.</font>

37
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,075
<font color="yellow">I hope it'll work out.</font>

38
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,005
<font color="yellow">See you around.</font>

39
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,845
<font color="yellow">Salute! I loved your drama.</font>

40
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,104
<font color="yellow">What is he doing?</font>

41
00:01:57,105 --> 00:01:58,375
<font color="yellow">I see. Bye.</font>

42
00:01:58,575 --> 00:01:59,875
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

43
00:02:01,975 --> 00:02:04,445
<font color="yellow">You didn't watch that drama
because you failed the audition.</font>

44
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,105
<font color="yellow">I didn't watch because of Song Joong Ki.</font>

45
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:08,681
<font color="yellow">Has Eun Gab said anything about
the meeting with the director?</font>

46
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:09,865
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard anything yet.</font>

47
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:11,644
<font color="yellow">Let's just wait.</font>

48
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,345
<font color="yellow">Why don't you do something about it?</font>

49
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:16,845
<font color="yellow">When Mr. Kim can't do anything,
there's nothing I can do.</font>

50
00:02:17,305 --> 00:02:19,945
<font color="yellow">What makes you think so? You
want to become a manager.</font>

51
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:22,375
<font color="yellow">Show them what you have.</font>

52
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,555
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

53
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,804
<font color="yellow">If I lose this movie,</font>

54
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:28,325
<font color="yellow">I'll go back to Busan and start
a comic book cafe or something.</font>

55
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,475
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

56
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,075
<font color="yellow">He sounds serious.</font>

57
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:34,551
<font color="yellow">I don't want to end up at a comic
book cafe. Put yourself together.</font>

58
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,245
<font color="yellow">Are you going to follow him there?</font>

59
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,275
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, where are you?</font>

60
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:47,605
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

61
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:50,505
<font color="yellow">It's Sunday. I'm at church.
Do you have no faith?</font>

62
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,085
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- Do you have no conscience?</font>

63
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,645
<font color="yellow">Stop playing around...</font>

64
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:55,975
<font color="yellow">and have some faith.</font>

65
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,074
<font color="yellow">It's about Young Bin.</font>

66
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,404
<font color="yellow">If you're ready,</font>

67
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:00,745
<font color="yellow">- let's start.
- What about him?</font>

68
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,345
<font color="yellow">Kneel down...</font>

69
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,767
<font color="yellow">He's wondering when he'll
get to meet the director.</font>

70
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,137
<font color="yellow">He seems worried.</font>

71
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,967
<font color="yellow">He looks very serious.</font>

72
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:13,597
<font color="yellow">- While exhaling...
- Gosh.</font>

73
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:16,467
<font color="yellow">Come to my church alone.</font>

74
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:18,137
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

75
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:19,937
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Exhale again.</font>

76
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,837
<font color="yellow">Three, four...</font>

77
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:35,967
<font color="yellow">Turtle.</font>

78
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,137
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to work out?
- No.</font>

79
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,037
<font color="yellow">Working out makes you age.</font>

80
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,397
<font color="yellow">Look at his face. He got so many wrinkles.</font>

81
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:46,507
<font color="yellow">Don't get on my nerves.</font>

82
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:48,867
<font color="yellow">- I'm about to explode.
- Your face will explode.</font>

83
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,967
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

84
00:03:50,637 --> 00:03:52,037
<font color="yellow">I'll go meet Mr. Kim now.</font>

85
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,337
<font color="yellow">Tell him that I'm dying here.</font>

86
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:55,843
<font color="yellow">You haven't heard anything
about the audition yet?</font>

87
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:58,267
<font color="yellow">No. Do tell him about me.</font>

88
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:00,967
<font color="yellow">I'm so stressed out that I
lost all my motivation.</font>

89
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,467
<font color="yellow">I have no energy when I wake up.</font>

90
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,187
<font color="yellow">Isn't that because you're getting old?</font>

91
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,797
<font color="yellow">- See you.
- Hey.</font>

92
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,137
<font color="yellow">I want to meet the director this week.</font>

93
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,567
<font color="yellow">Should we try again? Start.</font>

94
00:04:14,897 --> 00:04:18,037
<font color="yellow">One, two, three...</font>

95
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:20,506
<font color="yellow">- Someone wants to talk to you.
- Please stay with him.</font>

96
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,507
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

97
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,507
<font color="yellow">- Let me help you.
- Okay.</font>

98
00:04:24,437 --> 00:04:25,507
<font color="yellow">Lower your arms slowly.</font>

99
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,037
<font color="yellow">Push your bottom backwards.</font>

100
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,007
<font color="yellow">Stay in this position.</font>

101
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,137
<font color="yellow">Slowly.</font>

102
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:37,196
<font color="yellow">How do you do this?</font>

103
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:38,597
<font color="yellow">I'm lost here.</font>

104
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:40,337
<font color="yellow">Please give me a second.</font>

105
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:41,767
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

106
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:43,297
<font color="yellow">Continue.</font>

107
00:04:43,437 --> 00:04:45,037
<font color="yellow">Am I doing this right?</font>

108
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,767
<font color="yellow">- I'm confused.
- Let me take a look.</font>

109
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:49,867
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

110
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,967
<font color="yellow">- Try going down.
- Okay.</font>

111
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:53,937
<font color="yellow">Stay there.</font>

112
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,037
<font color="yellow">Do you feel me on your bottom?</font>

113
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,557
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Try pushing me backwards.</font>

114
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:58,837
<font color="yellow">Further.</font>

115
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,197
<font color="yellow">All right. Stop.</font>

116
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,097
<font color="yellow">In that position, raise your upper body.</font>

117
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,237
<font color="yellow">- Raise what?
- Sorry?</font>

118
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:07,797
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

119
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:11,997
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

120
00:05:12,637 --> 00:05:15,197
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? What was I thinking?</font>

121
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:16,937
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

122
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:18,497
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

123
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:21,797
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- I can raise my upper body.</font>

124
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:38,497
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Is the service over?</font>

125
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,143
<font color="yellow">I can't talk on the phone
in the middle of a service.</font>

126
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:42,637
<font color="yellow">My wife would kill me if she
finds me standing here.</font>

127
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:46,267
<font color="yellow">What did Young Bin say?</font>

128
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,537
<font color="yellow">- Is he doing bad?
- Yes.</font>

129
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,097
<font color="yellow">He grills me about when he can
meet Director Lee Joon Ik.</font>

130
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:52,137
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

131
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:53,867
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

132
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,737
<font color="yellow">What can I do when he's
actively avoiding me?</font>

133
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,737
<font color="yellow">I've been praying so hard.</font>

134
00:05:57,997 --> 00:06:00,297
<font color="yellow">Young Bin seems to be having
trouble sleeping at night.</font>

135
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,566
<font color="yellow">I raised my dose of sleeping pills.</font>

136
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,196
<font color="yellow">Young Bin said if he loses this movie,</font>

137
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,837
<font color="yellow">he'll start a comic book cafe in Busan.</font>

138
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:11,467
<font color="yellow">- That sounds serious.
- It is.</font>

139
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,567
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

140
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,667
<font color="yellow">Give me a second.</font>

141
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,967
<font color="yellow">What time is it?</font>

142
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,497
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

143
00:06:22,497 --> 00:06:24,397
<font color="yellow">I forgot my car keys in there.</font>

144
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,937
<font color="yellow">- Let's walk.
- I have a car.</font>

145
00:06:27,037 --> 00:06:29,837
<font color="yellow">I can't get in that shabby car.
I have a family. Follow me.</font>

146
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:45,667
<font color="yellow"><i>(CATHOLIC CHURCH)</i></font>

147
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,837
<font color="yellow">What are we doing at a catholic church?</font>

148
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:49,867
<font color="yellow">- Were you baptized?
- No.</font>

149
00:06:49,967 --> 00:06:51,067
<font color="yellow">Wait here then.</font>

150
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,637
<font color="yellow">The director goes to this church.</font>

151
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,497
<font color="yellow">- I'll go meet him.
- Sorry?</font>

152
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:58,467
<font color="yellow">This wasn't planned. Wouldn't it annoy him?</font>

153
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:00,597
<font color="yellow">I'll pretend it's a coincidence.</font>

154
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,167
<font color="yellow">Can I go with you?</font>

155
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,367
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell him.</font>

156
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,467
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

157
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,917
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is a
customer service center?</font>

158
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:13,366
<font color="yellow">If we go together,
he'll see we're here to see him.</font>

159
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,537
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

160
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:25,636
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

161
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:28,667
<font color="yellow">Pray to your ancestors at least.</font>

162
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,267
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- I'm praying.</font>

163
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,537
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

164
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:46,937
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

165
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:48,697
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

166
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,897
<font color="yellow">- The director is...
- Yes.</font>

167
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,397
<font color="yellow">Thinking of casting another
actor for that role.</font>

168
00:07:55,737 --> 00:07:57,897
<font color="yellow">He made it clear that he
doesn't want a meeting.</font>

169
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:01,067
<font color="yellow">Why is he so against Young Bin?</font>

170
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:04,397
<font color="yellow">I asked him over and over again,
and he gave an honest answer.</font>

171
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:07,767
<font color="yellow">He wants to work with an actor,
not just a star.</font>

172
00:08:08,297 --> 00:08:10,837
<font color="yellow">Young Bin did a good job
in "The Flowers of Evil".</font>

173
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:12,036
<font color="yellow">Hasn't he watched that one?</font>

174
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:14,567
<font color="yellow">He watched one of his television dramas.</font>

175
00:08:15,137 --> 00:08:16,837
<font color="yellow">He thinks he's just a good-looking model.</font>

176
00:08:16,937 --> 00:08:19,497
<font color="yellow">I'm so stressed out.</font>

177
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,367
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

178
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:22,637
<font color="yellow">What should we do then?</font>

179
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,697
<font color="yellow">- For now, you and me...
- Yes.</font>

180
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,267
<font color="yellow">Hang on.</font>

181
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,237
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

182
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,067
<font color="yellow">Stay quiet.</font>

183
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,997
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter?
- Where are you?</font>

184
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:39,467
<font color="yellow">I was going to the bathroom,
but then I ran into a friend.</font>

185
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:41,083
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to bring him to our church.</font>

186
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,037
<font color="yellow">We should guide lost sheep, right?</font>

187
00:08:44,167 --> 00:08:46,937
<font color="yellow">I know you're lying.
I saw you talking on the phone.</font>

188
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,197
<font color="yellow">Did you sneak out of a service to work?</font>

189
00:08:49,937 --> 00:08:51,313
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious?
- That's not true.</font>

190
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,037
<font color="yellow">- I'll be right there.
- The service is over.</font>

191
00:08:54,797 --> 00:08:56,167
<font color="yellow">I'll take the car.</font>

192
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,937
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

193
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:02,937
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

194
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:06,997
<font color="yellow">- Bring your car here.
- Sorry?</font>

195
00:09:08,107 --> 00:09:09,267
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

196
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:18,567
<font color="yellow">Why is Ho Jin so quiet?
Did he meet Eun Gab?</font>

197
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:19,997
<font color="yellow">Be patient.</font>

198
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:22,667
<font color="yellow">Actors need patience.</font>

199
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,497
<font color="yellow">It's a spam.</font>

200
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,513
<font color="yellow">I thought it was about the audition.</font>

201
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:32,797
<font color="yellow">To make your waiting easier,
why don't we have some fun?</font>

202
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,327
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be at a
crowded place today.</font>

203
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:39,467
<font color="yellow">Is it a spam again? It's about my audition.</font>

204
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,997
<font color="yellow">- What happened?
- I didn't pass.</font>

205
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:48,997
<font color="yellow">You said it went well.</font>

206
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,497
<font color="yellow">I must have been wrong.</font>

207
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:55,067
<font color="yellow">Why am I so unlucky these days?</font>

208
00:09:55,237 --> 00:09:56,267
<font color="yellow">I wonder that, too.</font>

209
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,297
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

210
00:10:01,437 --> 00:10:02,467
<font color="yellow">Turtle.</font>

211
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:04,497
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

212
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,067
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Young Bin.
- Hi.</font>

213
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,197
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't you see me?</font>

214
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:12,637
<font color="yellow">I'm saying hi right now.
What's wrong with you?</font>

215
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:15,537
<font color="yellow">- Did you get dumped again?
- Again?</font>

216
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,537
<font color="yellow">Turtle, did you see G-Dragon
wearing that t-shirt?</font>

217
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:20,897
<font color="yellow">It's on his Instagram.</font>

218
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:25,237
<font color="yellow">I should have asked Yoo Ah In to wear it.</font>

219
00:10:25,797 --> 00:10:26,837
<font color="yellow">You're so unlucky, too.</font>

220
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:30,197
<font color="yellow">I think we're all cursed. Should
we hire an exorcist or something?</font>

221
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:33,197
<font color="yellow">What? Try visiting a
fortune teller at least.</font>

222
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:35,067
<font color="yellow">I know someone famous.</font>

223
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,337
<font color="yellow">Her nickname is Lady Chopstick.</font>

224
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,677
<font color="yellow">Even Lee Jung Jae and Jang
Dong Gun are her clients.</font>

225
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:41,337
<font color="yellow">She's famous among celebrities.</font>

226
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:44,097
<font color="yellow">- Lady Chopstick?
- Yes.</font>

227
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,067
<font color="yellow"><i>(FORTUNE TELLING)</i></font>

228
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,496
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

229
00:10:51,497 --> 00:10:52,497
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

230
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,667
<font color="yellow">You have no male energy.</font>

231
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,897
<font color="yellow">You're full of female energy.</font>

232
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:12,167
<font color="yellow">That's why you fail every time.</font>

233
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:15,696
<font color="yellow">Female energy? There's no girl around him.</font>

234
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,637
<font color="yellow">Now, I see. You're a woman.</font>

235
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,097
<font color="yellow">You're a woman at home, too.
You're a mother.</font>

236
00:11:21,937 --> 00:11:23,837
<font color="yellow">You like doing house chores.</font>

237
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:25,767
<font color="yellow">You like staying at home.</font>

238
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,667
<font color="yellow">In a word, you're a woman on the inside.</font>

239
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:30,237
<font color="yellow">You're a woman.</font>

240
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:32,167
<font color="yellow">You're just an empty man.</font>

241
00:11:32,967 --> 00:11:33,967
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

242
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,537
<font color="yellow">That's impossible.</font>

243
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:39,297
<font color="yellow">- I'm such a manly man.
- Cut it out.</font>

244
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,497
<font color="yellow">Cut it out.</font>

245
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,697
<font color="yellow">Why is she upset?</font>

246
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,777
<font color="yellow">Your body lost all energy too, right?</font>

247
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,867
<font color="yellow">I heard it's because I'm stressed out.</font>

248
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,937
<font color="yellow">You need to fill up some male energy.</font>

249
00:11:59,337 --> 00:12:02,537
<font color="yellow">Stay away from girls for the time being.</font>

250
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,127
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep with girls either.</font>

251
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,097
<font color="yellow">Stay around guys.</font>

252
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:09,667
<font color="yellow">Fill up your male energy.</font>

253
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:13,597
<font color="yellow">Then job offers will start pouring in.</font>

254
00:12:14,097 --> 00:12:15,097
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

255
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,097
<font color="yellow">You're supposed to live like a beggar,</font>

256
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,937
<font color="yellow">but you're a well-off beggar.</font>

257
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:25,667
<font color="yellow">Your efforts only benefit others.</font>

258
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:29,167
<font color="yellow">You dance at someone else's party.</font>

259
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:33,037
<font color="yellow">You live an okay life by
sticking around lucky ones.</font>

260
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,037
<font color="yellow">That's interesting.</font>

261
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,037
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

262
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:42,837
<font color="yellow">Everything you do will fail.</font>

263
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,167
<font color="yellow">Don't try anything. Just get married.</font>

264
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:48,597
<font color="yellow">Find a woman. You'll make a good husband.</font>

265
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:54,237
<font color="yellow">It'll be red under your feet all your life.</font>

266
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,197
<font color="yellow">Your eyes resemble those of foxes.</font>

267
00:12:58,267 --> 00:13:00,197
<font color="yellow">You seduce people.</font>

268
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,637
<font color="yellow">This time, you have to give up.</font>

269
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:06,637
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- It's over now.</font>

270
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:08,337
<font color="yellow">Another guy already took it.</font>

271
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:11,167
<font color="yellow">If you become greedy,
you'll get an upset stomach.</font>

272
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,097
<font color="yellow">Find something else.</font>

273
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:29,137
<font color="yellow">You're working even on a weekend.</font>

274
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,767
<font color="yellow">You're taking my weekend away.</font>

275
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,867
<font color="yellow">We have no weekends as long
as we stay in this field.</font>

276
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:35,667
<font color="yellow">Have you been working out?</font>

277
00:13:35,797 --> 00:13:37,797
<font color="yellow">I drank too much.
My body was feeling heavy.</font>

278
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,087
<font color="yellow">- You don't drink, do you?
- Of course not.</font>

279
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:42,597
<font color="yellow">I suffered so much when I just started out.</font>

280
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:45,497
<font color="yellow">- Would you like some coffee?
- I'm okay.</font>

281
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,096
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

282
00:13:48,097 --> 00:13:49,736
<font color="yellow">I'm Young Bin's manager.</font>

283
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,097
<font color="yellow">- We met...
- I see.</font>

284
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:53,097
<font color="yellow">Go ahead.</font>

285
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:55,597
<font color="yellow">I met the director.</font>

286
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:58,243
<font color="yellow">He made it clear that he
doesn't want Young Bin.</font>

287
00:13:58,267 --> 00:14:00,267
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you on Monday.</font>

288
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:03,367
<font color="yellow">I don't think Young Bin
will get the contract.</font>

289
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,937
<font color="yellow">Didn't we make a verbal contract?</font>

290
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,743
<font color="yellow">Let's sign the contract and
persuade the director together.</font>

291
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:11,767
<font color="yellow">He won't change his mind.
There's nothing I can do.</font>

292
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,797
<font color="yellow">You have so much power these days.</font>

293
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:17,097
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

294
00:14:17,597 --> 00:14:18,737
<font color="yellow">I don't know about that.</font>

295
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,137
<font color="yellow">Have you even tried?</font>

296
00:14:20,697 --> 00:14:23,637
<font color="yellow">Did you negotiate with other
actors behind our back?</font>

297
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,697
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

298
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:29,036
<font color="yellow">How will I work with your actors
if you speak to me so rudely?</font>

299
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,957
<font color="yellow">If you keep stabbing us in the back,
I can't let my actors work with you.</font>

300
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:33,937
<font color="yellow">Don't you see that?</font>

301
00:14:40,737 --> 00:14:42,396
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, why did you fight with her?</font>

302
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:43,637
<font color="yellow">We might lose the movie.</font>

303
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:46,137
<font color="yellow">Were you dozing off?
We already lost the movie.</font>

304
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:47,967
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

305
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:52,497
<font color="yellow">Are you breaking down?</font>

306
00:14:53,837 --> 00:14:55,997
<font color="yellow">If you can't handle this much,
you better quit.</font>

307
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,597
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried about Young Bin.</font>

308
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,857
<font color="yellow">- What should I tell him?
- Don't say anything to him.</font>

309
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,467
<font color="yellow">Let me take care of it.</font>

310
00:15:04,297 --> 00:15:05,367
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

311
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,937
<font color="yellow">Manager Kim, it's me.</font>

312
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:10,297
<font color="yellow">Send me a list of the
movies we're considering.</font>

313
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,367
<font color="yellow">I'm camping with my wife.</font>

314
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,167
<font color="yellow">We just set up the tent.</font>

315
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:18,067
<font color="yellow">How are you going to pay back
your loan when you're fired?</font>

316
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:20,266
<font color="yellow">You'll have to live in that tent.</font>

317
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,667
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, I really can't work today.</font>

318
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:23,067
<font color="yellow">Please wait until tomorrow.</font>

319
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:25,896
<font color="yellow">I'll beat you up until you
can't set up that tent again.</font>

320
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:27,367
<font color="yellow">Send it to me right now, okay?</font>

321
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,936
<font color="yellow">Are you going to...</font>

322
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:31,767
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk so much today?</font>

323
00:15:34,197 --> 00:15:35,337
<font color="yellow">Where's the parking lot?</font>

324
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,367
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

325
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,167
<font color="yellow">It's Young Bin.</font>

326
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,837
<font color="yellow">Hi, Young Bin.</font>

327
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,267
<font color="yellow">Make something up.</font>

328
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:44,337
<font color="yellow">- Tell him you're driving.
- I'm driving right now.</font>

329
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,743
<font color="yellow">I've been waiting for your call.
How did it go?</font>

330
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:48,797
<font color="yellow">I'm driving right now.</font>

331
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,497
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you back.
- Okay.</font>

332
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:53,597
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

333
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,237
<font color="yellow">He's driving. He'll call me back.</font>

334
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:56,797
<font color="yellow">It doesn't feel right.</font>

335
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:58,497
<font color="yellow">Could the fortune teller be right?</font>

336
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:01,237
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I shouldn't have visited her.</font>

337
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:02,736
<font color="yellow">You at least know what to do.</font>

338
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,267
<font color="yellow">Young Bin has to give up the movie,</font>

339
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,136
<font color="yellow">and I shouldn't even try anything.</font>

340
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:07,667
<font color="yellow">Let's not trust her too much.</font>

341
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:10,037
<font color="yellow">Should we have some fun?</font>

342
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,897
<font color="yellow">- Where do you want to go?
- Garosu-gil.</font>

343
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,097
<font color="yellow">No. There are too many girls.</font>

344
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:15,536
<font color="yellow">Are you going to trust the fortune teller?</font>

345
00:16:15,537 --> 00:16:17,967
<font color="yellow">She knew everything about me.</font>

346
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:19,967
<font color="yellow">Go somewhere full of men.</font>

347
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,837
<font color="yellow">Somewhere full of male energy.</font>

348
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,067
<font color="yellow">Somewhere full of men?</font>

349
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,337
<font color="yellow">I need male energy.</font>

350
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,167
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

351
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:37,697
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

352
00:16:50,637 --> 00:16:51,967
<font color="yellow">I know who those players are.</font>

353
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,167
<font color="yellow">I'm a fan. I should get their autographs.</font>

354
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,267
<font color="yellow">Do that.</font>

355
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:00,237
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better?</font>

356
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:03,337
<font color="yellow">Yes. Male energy is filling up.</font>

357
00:17:05,437 --> 00:17:06,697
<font color="yellow">I wish Ho Jin was here.</font>

358
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:09,097
<font color="yellow">- Give him a call.
- Should I?</font>

359
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,737
<font color="yellow">Hello? He's not picking up.</font>

360
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:17,937
<font color="yellow">He's not?</font>

361
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:21,067
<font color="yellow">Do you feel nervous without him?</font>

362
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,396
<font color="yellow">Give him some space.</font>

363
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,497
<font color="yellow">Just focus on the game.</font>

364
00:17:25,897 --> 00:17:26,897
<font color="yellow">It's starting.</font>

365
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,467
<font color="yellow">It's been always the best
since it started in 2012.</font>

366
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:43,337
<font color="yellow">The most exciting match ever...</font>

367
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,537
<font color="yellow">is about to start.</font>

368
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:49,807
<font color="yellow">The finals...</font>

369
00:17:50,097 --> 00:17:55,097
<font color="yellow">start...</font>

370
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,236
<font color="yellow">now.</font>

371
00:17:57,237 --> 00:17:58,237
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

372
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:05,867
<font color="yellow">Why are the lights on?</font>

373
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,467
<font color="yellow">Young Bin keeps asking me where I am.</font>

374
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:10,467
<font color="yellow">Tell him we're in a meeting.</font>

375
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,307
<font color="yellow">Is someone in the meeting room?</font>

376
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:14,807
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

377
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:18,867
<font color="yellow">- Wait here.
- Okay.</font>

378
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,197
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

379
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:26,737
<font color="yellow">The whole board of directors
are here without me.</font>

380
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:28,597
<font color="yellow">Are you conspiring something?</font>

381
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,367
<font color="yellow">Watch your language.</font>

382
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:33,873
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here on a weekend?</font>

383
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:35,643
<font color="yellow">Did your wife kick you
out of her apartment?</font>

384
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:38,197
<font color="yellow">We own it together.</font>

385
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,367
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

386
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,837
<font color="yellow">Don't give her full ownership.</font>

387
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:43,897
<font color="yellow">You'll be left with nothing
if you get a divorce.</font>

388
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:46,697
<font color="yellow">Are you here with a girl?</font>

389
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:49,717
<font color="yellow">- Are you having an affair?
- I need to talk to you.</font>

390
00:18:50,037 --> 00:18:51,937
<font color="yellow">That rude brat.</font>

391
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,337
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

392
00:18:58,467 --> 00:19:00,067
<font color="yellow">You're Young Bin's manager.</font>

393
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,827
<font color="yellow">- It's nice to see you again.
- Hello.</font>

394
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:04,967
<font color="yellow">- Wait in my office.
- Okay.</font>

395
00:19:05,837 --> 00:19:06,867
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me now.</font>

396
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:14,597
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

397
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:16,497
<font color="yellow">We're just building our friendship.</font>

398
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:19,866
<font color="yellow">Why on a weekend behind my back?</font>

399
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,837
<font color="yellow">You're too young to understand it.</font>

400
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:25,736
<font color="yellow">Don't try to fool me.</font>

401
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:28,396
<font color="yellow">You're trying to sell our company.
Do you think I'm an idiot?</font>

402
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:29,467
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

403
00:19:30,197 --> 00:19:31,637
<font color="yellow">You're smarter than I thought.</font>

404
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,397
<font color="yellow">You're afraid I'll oppose.</font>

405
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:36,967
<font color="yellow">Let's sell some shares and take
some money in our pockets.</font>

406
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,807
<font color="yellow">Take some in your pocket
before it's too late.</font>

407
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:41,437
<font color="yellow">That's absurd.</font>

408
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:44,496
<font color="yellow">They know nothing about
entertainment industry.</font>

409
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,737
<font color="yellow">You said what we wanted was
management, not business.</font>

410
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,783
<font color="yellow">You were the one who said that.
Don't you remember?</font>

411
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,813
<font color="yellow">- Do you have dementia?
- Why do you think I'm doing this?</font>

412
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,197
<font color="yellow">Do your job first.</font>

413
00:19:53,197 --> 00:19:54,597
<font color="yellow">I got a call from Ms. Jo Tae Young.</font>

414
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,667
<font color="yellow">You made such a mess.</font>

415
00:19:56,997 --> 00:19:59,367
<font color="yellow">She stabbed me in the back.</font>

416
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,497
<font color="yellow">I even got CJ involved.</font>

417
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,167
<font color="yellow">Is this all you can do?</font>

418
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:05,497
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

419
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,707
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I don't see
the point of talking to you.</font>

420
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:11,037
<font color="yellow">In any case, I'll never go along with it.</font>

421
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:16,267
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

422
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:20,437
<font color="yellow">That lady is blinded by money.</font>

423
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:24,497
<font color="yellow">Never let her meet Young Bin, okay?</font>

424
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,397
<font color="yellow">How could I do that? She's a co-CEO.</font>

425
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:31,067
<font color="yellow">She's just lending us her name.
I'm the real CEO and your boss.</font>

426
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,137
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

427
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,137
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

428
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:37,697
<font color="yellow">These movies start shooting this year.</font>

429
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,437
<font color="yellow">Read them all and pick
one by tonight, okay?</font>

430
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:43,137
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

431
00:20:52,267 --> 00:20:53,667
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

432
00:20:53,737 --> 00:20:56,217
<font color="yellow">Are you going to tell Young Bin
the truth and make him get up?</font>

433
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:00,137
<font color="yellow">- You'll ignore me anyway.
- That's right.</font>

434
00:21:00,297 --> 00:21:01,297
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

435
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:04,767
<font color="yellow">If he knows what's happening
right now, he'll go awry.</font>

436
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,173
<font color="yellow">You can't discuss with someone
that doesn't have the right mind.</font>

437
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:10,067
<font color="yellow">Let's say his loving fiancee left
on the day of their wedding.</font>

438
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:12,597
<font color="yellow">Then we should bring to
him someone more lovable.</font>

439
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,927
<font color="yellow">Actors are simpler than you think.</font>

440
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:16,957
<font color="yellow">If he finds a good script,
he'll forget about it.</font>

441
00:21:18,437 --> 00:21:20,937
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- How can you read this?</font>

442
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,867
<font color="yellow">The font is too small.</font>

443
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,387
<font color="yellow">- Did you talk to Young Bin earlier?
- Yes.</font>

444
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,037
<font color="yellow">How did he sound?</font>

445
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,048
<font color="yellow">I think he's okay since he
doesn't know what's happening.</font>

446
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,337
<font color="yellow">He looks rather happy.</font>

447
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,167
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

448
00:21:46,837 --> 00:21:48,367
<font color="yellow">He's fine then, right?</font>

449
00:21:48,397 --> 00:21:49,397
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

450
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:50,737
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and read.</font>

451
00:21:56,437 --> 00:22:00,567
<font color="yellow"><i>(CJ ENTUS AUTOGRAPH EVENT)</i></font>

452
00:22:00,597 --> 00:22:02,767
<font color="yellow">Why is the line so long?</font>

453
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:04,197
<font color="yellow">It's not getting shorter.</font>

454
00:22:05,937 --> 00:22:07,867

00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,967
<font color="yellow">No, we have to get their signatures.</font>

460
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,097
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you getting one?
- Of course, I want one.</font>

461
00:22:20,737 --> 00:22:21,797
<font color="yellow">Hey, watch out.</font>

462
00:22:24,037 --> 00:22:25,067
<font color="yellow">Protect me.</font>

463
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,797
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go.</font>

464
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,897
<font color="yellow">Anyway, who do you keep calling?</font>

465
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,167
<font color="yellow">Who else? It's Ho Jin.</font>

466
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:32,797
<font color="yellow">You must be missing him dearly.</font>

467
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:35,777
<font color="yellow">Both Ho Jin and Eun Gab aren't picking up.</font>

468
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:38,397
<font color="yellow">Something must have gone wrong.</font>

469
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:40,467
<font color="yellow">That's the only time
Eun Gab doesn't pick up.</font>

470
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:44,567
<font color="yellow">Why is Ho Jin being like Eun Gab?</font>

471
00:22:47,337 --> 00:22:49,636
<font color="yellow">Do you want to show security your face...</font>

472
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,436
<font color="yellow">so we can leave after
getting the signature?</font>

473
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,997
<font color="yellow">We're already in the line. Let's wait.</font>

474
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,097
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

475
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:57,896
<font color="yellow">Turtle. Turtle.</font>

476
00:22:57,897 --> 00:22:59,437
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

477
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:06,767
<font color="yellow">Don't take photos.</font>

478
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:09,897
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

479
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:22,037
<font color="yellow">She's my favorite character.
I need a picture.</font>

480
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,967
<font color="yellow">He's so excited.</font>

481
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,697
<font color="yellow">- Were you really upset earlier?
- That's what I mean.</font>

482
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,467
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but that's it for photo time.</font>

483
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:37,297
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

484
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:38,867
<font color="yellow">No...</font>

485
00:23:38,937 --> 00:23:41,937
<font color="yellow">Gosh, nothing ever works.
That fortune teller was right.</font>

486
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:45,537
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. I'm sorry,</font>

487
00:23:47,197 --> 00:23:48,637
<font color="yellow">but could I ask you for a favor?</font>

488
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,037
<font color="yellow">Look at him.</font>

489
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,367
<font color="yellow">You should take one, too.</font>

490
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,067
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

491
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:02,737
<font color="yellow">Who cares what the fortune teller said?</font>

492
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:04,197
<font color="yellow">You'll regret this later.</font>

493
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,013
<font color="yellow">I need to get a role if
this is what I have to do.</font>

494
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,367
<font color="yellow">I don't need her picture.</font>

495
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:09,967
<font color="yellow">I'm not jealous of Turtle.</font>

496
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:26,967
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

497
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,267
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Ji An?</font>

498
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,997
<font color="yellow">You got me.</font>

499
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,397
<font color="yellow">Why are we... Why are you here?</font>

500
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,997
<font color="yellow">I came to pick up my mom.
We're having dinner.</font>

501
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:40,397
<font color="yellow">- Your mother?
- Yes.</font>

502
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,567
<font color="yellow">Right, I see.</font>

503
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:47,367
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right?
- Yes.</font>

504
00:24:48,967 --> 00:24:50,637
<font color="yellow">Are you working on a weekend?</font>

505
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:53,037
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's something urgent.</font>

506
00:24:54,197 --> 00:24:56,437
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang is in the meeting room.</font>

507
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,367
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

508
00:25:02,637 --> 00:25:04,997
<font color="yellow">- What's this?
- I was going to leave it here.</font>

509
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,267
<font color="yellow">- See you next time.
- Okay.</font>

510
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,857
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOU LOOK TIRED. HAVE SOME
COFFEE AND CHEER UP.)</i></font>

511
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,437
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

512
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:26,096
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- What happened...</font>

513
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:28,497
<font color="yellow">to your friend whom you wanted
to set up a blind date for?</font>

514
00:25:29,937 --> 00:25:32,997
<font color="yellow">Well, I...</font>

515
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:34,967
<font color="yellow">I didn't contact him.</font>

516
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,697
<font color="yellow">Did you get a girlfriend?</font>

517
00:25:36,837 --> 00:25:37,837
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

518
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:39,697
<font color="yellow">Your friends told me you broke up.</font>

519
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:42,667
<font color="yellow">Yes, I don't have one.</font>

520
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:44,197
<font color="yellow">I didn't have one.</font>

521
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:46,467
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

522
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,567
<font color="yellow">I have people asking me to
introduce them to guys.</font>

523
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:54,767
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the coffee.</font>

524
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:57,437
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

525
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:58,997
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

526
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,367
<font color="yellow">All right, that's good.</font>

527
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:02,437
<font color="yellow">What? The tent?</font>

528
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:04,737
<font color="yellow">Fine, keep it up.</font>

529
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:08,267
<font color="yellow">What happened? Why are you smirking?</font>

530
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,367
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

531
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,737
<font color="yellow">- Read this one.
- Okay.</font>

532
00:26:12,967 --> 00:26:15,097
<font color="yellow">If Young Bin says okay, we can go with it.</font>

533
00:26:15,937 --> 00:26:18,437
<font color="yellow">There are two main roles,
and Kim Yun Seok is in it.</font>

534
00:26:19,737 --> 00:26:20,867
<font color="yellow">- Read it fast.
- Okay.</font>

535
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:24,337
<font color="yellow"><i>(METROPOLITAN INVESTIGATION TEAM)</i></font>

536
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:41,667
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the document yet.</font>

537
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,897
<font color="yellow">- Did you finish it?
- Yes.</font>

538
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:58,167
<font color="yellow">It has a good story,</font>

539
00:26:58,767 --> 00:27:00,967
<font color="yellow">but is this the final version?
It needs a lot of edits.</font>

540
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:01,997
<font color="yellow">It's good enough.</font>

541
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:03,997
<font color="yellow">Call Young Bin.</font>

542
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:05,897
<font color="yellow">- Right now?
- Yes.</font>

543
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,437
<font color="yellow">Make sure you do as I told you.</font>

544
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:14,007
<font color="yellow">- Don't say anything stupid.
- Okay.</font>

545
00:27:14,437 --> 00:27:16,097
<font color="yellow">Why does he want to meet here?</font>

546
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:17,537
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

547
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:21,737
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

548
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:24,367
<font color="yellow">Young Bin.</font>

549
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:25,897
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hey.</font>

550
00:27:25,898 --> 00:27:27,167
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

551
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,337
<font color="yellow">Why is this place so loud?</font>

552
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:31,197
<font color="yellow">Joon wanted to go someplace without women.</font>

553
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:34,597
<font color="yellow">Without women? What kind
of nonsense is that?</font>

554
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:36,167
<font color="yellow">Are you coming out of the closet?</font>

555
00:27:36,297 --> 00:27:38,666
<font color="yellow">No, but I have a reason for...</font>

556
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:42,137
<font color="yellow">Hey, I was with this guy the whole day.</font>

557
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,767
<font color="yellow">We're like Sherlock and
Watson or Mulder and Scully.</font>

558
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,197
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

559
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:49,097
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

560
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:51,067
<font color="yellow">There's this detective buddy film.</font>

561
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,136
<font color="yellow">You'd be partnering up with Kim Yun Seok.</font>

562
00:27:53,137 --> 00:27:55,673
<font color="yellow">The script is good, and they're
almost confirmed for investment.</font>

563
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,613
<font color="yellow">- What do you think?
- Why are you bringing that up?</font>

564
00:27:57,637 --> 00:27:58,757
<font color="yellow">What about "War Terminator"?</font>

565
00:27:59,737 --> 00:28:03,067
<font color="yellow">They cast Kim Soo Hyun.
Let's forget about that one.</font>

566
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,367
<font color="yellow">Is this true?</font>

567
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:08,797
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

568
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:11,496
<font color="yellow">I think it turned out for the better.</font>

569
00:28:11,497 --> 00:28:13,697
<font color="yellow">It was a bad film anyway.</font>

570
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:16,297
<font color="yellow">This one is so much better.</font>

571
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,836
<font color="yellow">It's a buddy film. Bromance is so trendy.</font>

572
00:28:19,837 --> 00:28:21,537
<font color="yellow">Also, you'll act with Yun Seok.</font>

573
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:24,597
<font color="yellow">Your acting will look so much better.
Do you get me?</font>

574
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:28,266
<font color="yellow">Also, your character is really nice.</font>

575
00:28:28,267 --> 00:28:30,396
<font color="yellow">It's realistic.</font>

576
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:32,473
<font color="yellow">What happened to the meeting
with Director Lee Joon Ik?</font>

577
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:35,437
<font color="yellow">They've already confirmed the cast.
A meeting is unnecessary.</font>

578
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:36,967
<font color="yellow">I still want to meet him.</font>

579
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:38,237
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

580
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,137
<font color="yellow">Can I be honest with you?</font>

581
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:44,897
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

582
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:48,997
<font color="yellow">We went to see the director at the church,</font>

583
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,497
<font color="yellow">and he declined.</font>

584
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:55,567
<font color="yellow">In his words, he says you're...</font>

585
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:57,966
<font color="yellow">more like a model than an actor.</font>

586
00:28:57,967 --> 00:29:00,396
<font color="yellow">Don't say it like that.
He'll misunderstand.</font>

587
00:29:00,397 --> 00:29:02,137
<font color="yellow">He should know exactly what happened.</font>

588
00:29:03,267 --> 00:29:05,366
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but we'll have
to look for something else.</font>

589
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:06,897
<font color="yellow">This is an alternative.</font>

590
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:08,437
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

591
00:29:08,737 --> 00:29:11,367
<font color="yellow">If you don't like it,
I'll look for something else.</font>

592
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:14,437
<font color="yellow">There are a million scripts.</font>

593
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,797
<font color="yellow">Are you all right? Are you mad?</font>

594
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:25,396
<font color="yellow">If you are, take it out on me.
I'll let you do it.</font>

595
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,897
<font color="yellow">I'll ring the golden ball...
I mean the golden bell.</font>

596
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:31,167
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

597
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,967
<font color="yellow">Why would I be mad at you? It's my fault.</font>

598
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,237
<font color="yellow">It's not your fault.</font>

599
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:39,397
<font color="yellow">It has nothing to do with you.
It just wasn't the right film.</font>

600
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,266
<font color="yellow">You run into some of these time to time.</font>

601
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:43,637
<font color="yellow">It can happen.
You shouldn't do such a film.</font>

602
00:29:43,997 --> 00:29:45,067
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

603
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,067
<font color="yellow">I understand the situation.</font>

604
00:29:51,797 --> 00:29:52,797
<font color="yellow">Thank you for trying.</font>

605
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,707
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I'm going to go.</font>

606
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,067
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

607
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,766
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin.
- Good night.</font>

608
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,767
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

609
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,436
<font color="yellow">- Take care.
- Bye.</font>

610
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,467
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

611
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:07,337
<font color="yellow">Young Bin.</font>

612
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,666
<font color="yellow">I said not to say anything stupid.</font>

613
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,337
<font color="yellow">Why are you being so direct?
You're so inexperienced.</font>

614
00:30:22,637 --> 00:30:24,697
<font color="yellow">- What are you going to do?
- I'm sorry.</font>

615
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,837
<font color="yellow">I'll go talk to him.</font>

616
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:31,767
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll drive you.</font>

617
00:30:31,967 --> 00:30:32,967
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

618
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:36,567
<font color="yellow">Go and talk to Young Bin.</font>

619
00:30:37,197 --> 00:30:38,237
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

620
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:41,037
<font color="yellow">keep an eye on him at night just in case.</font>

621
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:43,997
<font color="yellow">Actors...</font>

622
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,397
<font color="yellow">often do something idiotic at night.</font>

623
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,417
<font color="yellow">Young Bin won't do that, though.</font>

624
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:50,637
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

625
00:30:51,037 --> 00:30:52,067
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

626
00:31:20,197 --> 00:31:22,277
<font color="yellow">You must be upset.
Do you want me to cook something?</font>

627
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:24,637
<font color="yellow">No. This is why I don't
have enough stamina.</font>

628
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,737
<font color="yellow">- You cook.
- Why?</font>

629
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,247
<font color="yellow">Let's just eat cup noodles.</font>

630
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,567
<font color="yellow">I don't want any. I'm going to bed.</font>

631
00:31:31,437 --> 00:31:33,797
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to talk?
- No, I had enough today.</font>

632
00:31:35,267 --> 00:31:38,667
<font color="yellow">Don't ignore me. That
scenario earlier isn't bad.</font>

633
00:31:40,797 --> 00:31:42,157
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to make of this.</font>

634
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:45,367
<font color="yellow">I thought I was in "War Terminator"
for the last few weeks.</font>

635
00:31:46,597 --> 00:31:47,797
<font color="yellow">Today, I'm suddenly not in it.</font>

636
00:31:50,337 --> 00:31:53,567
<font color="yellow">I feel so strange. I don't know what to do.</font>

637
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:56,697
<font color="yellow">It's not just you. I feel that way, too.</font>

638
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:00,037
<font color="yellow">What can we do? We have to get over it.</font>

639
00:32:01,737 --> 00:32:02,797
<font color="yellow">Do you want a drink?</font>

640
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,037
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to drink.
I'm going to bed.</font>

641
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,797
<font color="yellow">Just let him be.
I bet he'll just sleep for a few days.</font>

642
00:32:20,597 --> 00:32:21,797
<font color="yellow">It's a little scary.</font>

643
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,017
<font color="yellow">What the Lady Chopstick said all came true.</font>

644
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:25,567
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

645
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,413
<font color="yellow">We went to get our fortunes read.</font>

646
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:29,243
<font color="yellow">She said Young Bin will
have trouble with work.</font>

647
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,367
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- My goodness.</font>

648
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:31,997
<font color="yellow">She really is talented.</font>

649
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:33,637
<font color="yellow">I didn't want her to be right.</font>

650
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:36,387
<font color="yellow">I don't want to end up living off
others like what she told me.</font>

651
00:32:36,697 --> 00:32:37,937
<font color="yellow">She's really good.</font>

652
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:40,667
<font color="yellow">- Why didn't you read mine, too?
- We did.</font>

653
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,867
<font color="yellow">You will neither get married nor even date.</font>

654
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:46,137
<font color="yellow">Your partner is your left hand.</font>

655
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:47,537
<font color="yellow">This is no time to joke.</font>

656
00:32:48,997 --> 00:32:50,873
<font color="yellow">Why? Did you want to ask
her about your love life?</font>

657
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,367
<font color="yellow">No, about career.</font>

658
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:57,137
<font color="yellow">I thought you were with Eun Gab
the whole day as partners.</font>

659
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:58,237
<font color="yellow">Partners? No way.</font>

660
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:01,297
<font color="yellow">I was only chasing things around.</font>

661
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:02,897
<font color="yellow">I have nothing else to do.</font>

662
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:05,197
<font color="yellow">I don't even know if this
is helpful for Young Bin.</font>

663
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,997
<font color="yellow">What have I been doing all day?</font>

664
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:11,037
<font color="yellow">Not you, too.</font>

665
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:14,237
<font color="yellow">You guys are sighing all day.
It's annoying.</font>

666
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,347
<font color="yellow">I need something to cheer me up.</font>

667
00:33:22,997 --> 00:33:23,997
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

668
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:25,837
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear the fortune teller?</font>

669
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:27,867
<font color="yellow">Young Bin...</font>

670
00:33:29,097 --> 00:33:30,936
<font color="yellow">Starting today, women are forbidden.
You can't talk about them.</font>

671
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,637
<font color="yellow">Anything with women are all forbidden.</font>

672
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:41,207
<font color="yellow">It's Kim Do Yeon.</font>

673
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:43,767
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you idiots.</font>

674
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:49,237
<font color="yellow">What is that smell?</font>

675
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:53,097
<font color="yellow">Is that eel?</font>

676
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,167
<font color="yellow">You're cooking eel in the morning?</font>

677
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,797
<font color="yellow">You're really too much.</font>

678
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:02,897
<font color="yellow">He's killing me.</font>

679
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:05,367
<font color="yellow">He's trying so hard to
get his man energy back.</font>

680
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:07,666
<font color="yellow">We went to Garak Market this morning.</font>

681
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:08,707
<font color="yellow">You're awesome.</font>

682
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:11,367
<font color="yellow">Should I have some
raspberry wine with this?</font>

683
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,896
<font color="yellow">Why would you? It would be useless for you.</font>

684
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:16,037
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. All she said was right.</font>

685
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,797
<font color="yellow">You'll jinx me, so stop complaining.</font>

686
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:23,297
<font color="yellow">How long are you going
to take to clean those?</font>

687
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,737
<font color="yellow">- Where is Young Bin?
- He didn't come out yet.</font>

688
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,137
<font color="yellow">I think he was walking around when
I was playing games last night.</font>

689
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:34,706
<font color="yellow">This is too much for breakfast.
Didn't you make any soup?</font>

690
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,167
<font color="yellow">Soup? No way.</font>

691
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,737
<font color="yellow">Just eat what I give you.</font>

692
00:34:37,897 --> 00:34:39,097
<font color="yellow">I don't like this.</font>

693
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:40,897
<font color="yellow">Eels for breakfast?</font>

694
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,367
<font color="yellow">Don't we have soup?</font>

695
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,867
<font color="yellow">Why are you copying Ho Jin?</font>

696
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,337
<font color="yellow">- Just eat what I make you.
- Okay.</font>

697
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:51,567
<font color="yellow">I thought you couldn't sleep.
Why are you up?</font>

698
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,267
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep after breakfast. I
don't have anything to do anyway.</font>

699
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,767
<font color="yellow">Is Ji An starting the construction today?</font>

700
00:34:58,167 --> 00:34:59,243
<font color="yellow">I don't want it to be noisy.</font>

701
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:00,867
<font color="yellow">No, don't worry. She'll start next week.</font>

702
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,897
<font color="yellow">That's good. Don't let any women
come in here for a while.</font>

703
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,887
<font color="yellow">There isn't a single woman
that would come here.</font>

704
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:09,466
<font color="yellow">- That makes me sad.
- Hold on.</font>

705
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:11,967
<font color="yellow">You don't want Ji An to come?
Until when?</font>

706
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:14,067
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you upset you
won't get to see her?</font>

707
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,797
<font color="yellow">Ask her out for a date then.</font>

708
00:35:17,797 --> 00:35:20,337
<font color="yellow">No, I'm talking about the construction.</font>

709
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,207
<font color="yellow">You should call So Hee then.</font>

710
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:26,207
<font color="yellow">- Are you making fun of me?
- Do you feel guilty?</font>

711
00:35:28,097 --> 00:35:30,497
<font color="yellow">I mean, you should tell her about the film.</font>

712
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,367
<font color="yellow">Later.</font>

713
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,967
<font color="yellow">How is the new film's scenario? Is it good?</font>

714
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,237
<font color="yellow">- I think it's good.
- Do you mean Ji An?</font>

715
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,667
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Then I'll do it.</font>

716
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,897
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

717
00:35:45,737 --> 00:35:47,137
<font color="yellow">If you think it's okay,</font>

718
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:48,937
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it's okay.</font>

719
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,497
<font color="yellow">I don't want to waste my time.</font>

720
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:54,837
<font color="yellow">Tell Eun Gab I'll do it.</font>

721
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:57,367
<font color="yellow">Yes. Don't worry so much.</font>

722
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,887
<font color="yellow">- Things will work out.
- Between you and Ji An?</font>

723
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,337
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

724
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:14,867
<font color="yellow">I feel like the film's
finished with all of you here.</font>

725
00:36:15,937 --> 00:36:18,637
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's do our best, Mr.
Cha Young Bin.</font>

726
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:19,737
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

727
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:24,367
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

728
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,167
<font color="yellow">I know you declined our offer before.</font>

729
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,537
<font color="yellow">Did you really get out of the other film?</font>

730
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:31,497
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's why we came to see you.</font>

731
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:33,067
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about that.</font>

732
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,267
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

733
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:38,597
<font color="yellow">- Let's sign our papers this week.
- Sure.</font>

734
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:40,297
<font color="yellow">Right, Mr. Kim...</font>

735
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:48,367
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so awkward for
me to call you formally.</font>

736
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:54,567
<font color="yellow">I've known Mr. Kim for a long time.</font>

737
00:36:55,497 --> 00:36:57,237
<font color="yellow">Let's not bring up the past.</font>

738
00:36:58,267 --> 00:37:01,937
<font color="yellow">Time really flies, doesn't it?</font>

739
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:05,837
<font color="yellow">I used to call him by
his first name before.</font>

740
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:08,767
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, you had a tough time...</font>

741
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,497
<font color="yellow">holding up the umbrella
for actors, didn't you?</font>

742
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:14,467
<font color="yellow">That's why I don't use one even
when it rains. I'm sick of it.</font>

743
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,236
<font color="yellow">I think we're done here,
so we'll get going.</font>

744
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,707
<font color="yellow">No, not yet. Don't get up.</font>

745
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:23,237
<font color="yellow">Do you like fishing?</font>

746
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:24,737
<font color="yellow">No, I've never done it.</font>

747
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,297
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

748
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:28,707
<font color="yellow">Let's go fishing later.</font>

749
00:37:29,597 --> 00:37:30,597
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

750
00:37:30,967 --> 00:37:34,437
<font color="yellow">To commemorate this day,
I'll give you a present.</font>

751
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:37,767
<font color="yellow">We're okay with fishing...
He's such a healthy guy.</font>

752
00:37:38,597 --> 00:37:39,637
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

753
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,237
<font color="yellow">This is good.</font>

754
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,707
<font color="yellow">- Here, take it.
- I'm okay.</font>

755
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:49,767
<font color="yellow">Come on. Take it. This is really expensive.</font>

756
00:37:52,297 --> 00:37:53,337
<font color="yellow">Watch.</font>

757
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,767
<font color="yellow">How does it look?</font>

758
00:37:56,937 --> 00:37:59,767
<font color="yellow">It's long and thick. Doesn't it look great?</font>

759
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:01,867
<font color="yellow">With this,</font>

760
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:04,397
<font color="yellow">you can hook in the audience...</font>

761
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:07,467
<font color="yellow">and women, too.</font>

762
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,167
<font color="yellow">All right, take it.</font>

763
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,637
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Yes.</font>

764
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,137
<font color="yellow">- We'll get going now.
- Okay.</font>

765
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,837
<font color="yellow">- Okay, bye.
- Bye.</font>

766
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:22,337
<font color="yellow">- Let's go fishing next time.
- Okay.</font>

767
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:24,167
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

768
00:38:24,497 --> 00:38:26,767
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since I worked with him.</font>

769
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,207
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you made the right decision.</font>

770
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,397
<font color="yellow">Okay. By the way, this
isn't a fishing film, right?</font>

771
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,213
<font color="yellow">All we talked about was fishing.
I was confused. Weren't you?</font>

772
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:36,497
<font color="yellow">I thought we were fishing. I almost yawned.</font>

773
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:38,637
<font color="yellow">If he saw you, he would bug you forever.</font>

774
00:38:38,797 --> 00:38:41,037
<font color="yellow">He's known for his bad temper.</font>

775
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:44,637
<font color="yellow">He beat up the director and actor
for a badly performing film once.</font>

776
00:38:44,737 --> 00:38:46,707
<font color="yellow">You need to be careful around him.
Got that?</font>

777
00:38:46,797 --> 00:38:47,797
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

778
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:48,997
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

779
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,737
<font color="yellow">- Did it go well?
- Yes, we decided to sign.</font>

780
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:53,767
<font color="yellow">- We'll get going.
- Okay.</font>

781
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,167
<font color="yellow">Rest well, and don't get stressed.</font>

782
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,137
<font color="yellow">Don't you take care of yourself?</font>

783
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,167
<font color="yellow">You and I could be friends.
You look like you're 40.</font>

784
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:07,367
<font color="yellow">I do?</font>

785
00:39:08,437 --> 00:39:09,437
<font color="yellow">- I'm going.
- Okay.</font>

786
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:10,707
<font color="yellow">Take better care of yourself.</font>

787
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:12,537
<font color="yellow">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

788
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:15,167
<font color="yellow">He never talks about work.</font>

789
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,137
<font color="yellow">Your face looks bad, though.
Are those dark circles?</font>

790
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,037
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my face?</font>

791
00:39:20,137 --> 00:39:22,577
<font color="yellow">You're piling up your man energy.
You have nowhere to use it.</font>

792
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:23,797
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

793
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:26,367
<font color="yellow">- It's called imposing charms.
- Sure.</font>

794
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:37,097
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even masturbate alone.</font>

795
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:38,737
<font color="yellow">You're going to burst if you keep it up.</font>

796
00:39:39,797 --> 00:39:41,207
<font color="yellow">What if you really faint?</font>

797
00:39:41,637 --> 00:39:43,597
<font color="yellow">You really need to stop all this silliness.</font>

798
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,267
<font color="yellow">How long do I have to do this?</font>

799
00:39:46,437 --> 00:39:49,037
<font color="yellow">She said I'd get a lot of
work just like a dog in heat.</font>

800
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,596
<font color="yellow">At this rate, you'll become the dog.</font>

801
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,797
<font color="yellow">How long do you have to do this? 20 years?</font>

802
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:56,837
<font color="yellow">This isn't working.
Should we go see Lady Chopstick again?</font>

803
00:39:58,067 --> 00:39:59,437
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

804
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:01,367
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

805
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,867
<font color="yellow">- Yes, this is Cha Joon!
- Gosh, he's loud.</font>

806
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,267
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

807
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,067
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm available.</font>

808
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,567
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes. See you tomorrow.</font>

809
00:40:13,137 --> 00:40:14,137
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

810
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:15,796
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
- What did they say?</font>

811
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:16,836
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

812
00:40:16,837 --> 00:40:19,437
<font color="yellow">I auditioned for this before,
and the actor fell through.</font>

813
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:20,837
<font color="yellow">They're asking me to fill in.</font>

814
00:40:21,297 --> 00:40:22,367
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

815
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,167
<font color="yellow">This is impossible.</font>

816
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,597
<font color="yellow">How can it be just as she said?</font>

817
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,207
<font color="yellow">I'm driving.</font>

818
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,767
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I listened to her.
I really got an offer.</font>

819
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,437
<font color="yellow">But I'm suddenly getting upset about this.</font>

820
00:40:35,537 --> 00:40:37,897
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll live off someone
for the rest of my life then.</font>

821
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:39,497
<font color="yellow">You're all responsible for me.</font>

822
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:46,437
<font color="yellow">Is it So Hee?</font>

823
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,197
<font color="yellow">How did you know?
You should be a fortune teller.</font>

824
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:51,797
<font color="yellow">You're pathetic.</font>

825
00:40:51,897 --> 00:40:53,817
<font color="yellow">How can you run over to
her as soon as she asks?</font>

826
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,513
<font color="yellow">He's in no place to play hard to get.</font>

827
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:57,643
<font color="yellow">If he does, she'll forget about him.
Don't you think?</font>

828
00:40:57,667 --> 00:41:00,167
<font color="yellow">These three eunuchs don't
have right to say anything.</font>

829
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:02,767
<font color="yellow">- I'm just going to keep quiet.
- I'm a eunuch?</font>

830
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,637
<font color="yellow">- I'm a eunuch?
- How can this be?</font>

831
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:08,067
<font color="yellow">- You're one, too.
- No way.</font>

832
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:09,397
<font color="yellow">You're crazy.</font>

833
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:11,397
<font color="yellow">- Hey, So Hee.
- Hello.</font>

834
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,536
<font color="yellow">Why are you here so early?
I'm not late, am I?</font>

835
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:16,937
<font color="yellow">- No, no.
- No.</font>

836
00:41:17,597 --> 00:41:18,707
<font color="yellow">He just couldn't wait.</font>

837
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:22,167
<font color="yellow">- Did you get my manager one?
- Yes.</font>

838
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,707
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

839
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,837
<font color="yellow">You asked us out for dinner...</font>

840
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,867
<font color="yellow">and this is where you treat us.</font>

841
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,867
<font color="yellow">I've been craving it. That's why.</font>

842
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:35,097
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you get soju?</font>

843
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,683
<font color="yellow">Can you drink?
Don't you have a shoot tomorrow?</font>

844
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:38,706
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. Ma'am.
- Yes?</font>

845
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:41,097
<font color="yellow">- Can we have a bottle of soju?
- Sure thing.</font>

846
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:46,167
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You look pretty.</font>

847
00:41:46,597 --> 00:41:48,336
<font color="yellow">That's disgusting. What's wrong with you?</font>

848
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:50,867
<font color="yellow">- Are you out of your mind?
- She's pretty.</font>

849
00:41:54,167 --> 00:41:56,367
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Joon saying anything?</font>

850
00:41:57,737 --> 00:42:01,297
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but tell her not to talk to me.</font>

851
00:42:01,797 --> 00:42:04,237
<font color="yellow">He's sorry, but don't talk to him.</font>

852
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:06,067
<font color="yellow">- Stop that.
- What?</font>

853
00:42:06,997 --> 00:42:08,537
<font color="yellow">- It's because...
- Stop.</font>

854
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,567
<font color="yellow">Don't mind him. He has his reasons.</font>

855
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,437
<font color="yellow">He's still the same.</font>

856
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:18,707
<font color="yellow">What happened?
Are you not doing "War Terminator"?</font>

857
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:20,237
<font color="yellow">No, I'm doing something else.</font>

858
00:42:20,367 --> 00:42:21,967
<font color="yellow">Already? What is it?</font>

859
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:24,043
<font color="yellow">It's a detective film. What about you?
Did you sign?</font>

860
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,067
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

861
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:28,797
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts since it's a hero film.</font>

862
00:42:29,137 --> 00:42:30,467
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure until the end,</font>

863
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,967
<font color="yellow">but I decided to do it after
meeting the director.</font>

864
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:37,097
<font color="yellow">Listening to his ideas excited me so much.</font>

865
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,287
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be really fun.</font>

866
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:40,937
<font color="yellow">I wish you were in it, too. I'm sad.</font>

867
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:42,167
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

868
00:42:49,537 --> 00:42:50,766
<font color="yellow">- What's your problem?
- Don't touch me.</font>

869
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,367
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

870
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:55,437
<font color="yellow">Tell her to stop. I have a reason.</font>

871
00:42:55,737 --> 00:42:57,137
<font color="yellow">- He's sorry that he's ugly.
- Hey.</font>

872
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:01,037
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

873
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:02,677
<font color="yellow">I'd love for another round of drinks,</font>

874
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:05,337
<font color="yellow">but I have a shoot early in the morning.
It's too bad.</font>

875
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:08,737
<font color="yellow">Visit our place next time.
We can drink then.</font>

876
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,797
<font color="yellow">Sure! I want to see what
your place looks like.</font>

877
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,537
<font color="yellow">Who's doing the interior design?</font>

878
00:43:14,637 --> 00:43:16,773
<font color="yellow">The designer's name is Suh Ji An.
She's well known in the industry.</font>

879
00:43:16,797 --> 00:43:18,297
<font color="yellow">Yes, I've heard of her name.</font>

880
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,797
<font color="yellow">I heard that she's popular
among male celebrities.</font>

881
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,737
<font color="yellow">- Did you hear that?
- Did you hear that?</font>

882
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,937
<font color="yellow">- What's going on, Ho Jin?
- What?</font>

883
00:43:25,037 --> 00:43:27,367
<font color="yellow">- Are you interested in her?
- No.</font>

884
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:29,437
<font color="yellow">He's very interested in her.</font>

885
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,038
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Don't listen to him. He's teasing me.</font>

886
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:34,867
<font color="yellow">- My van is here. I have to go.
- Bye.</font>

887
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:39,777
<font color="yellow">Joon, are you not even
going to say bye to me?</font>

888
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:42,666
<font color="yellow">- Don't worry about him. Just go.
- Yes, just get going.</font>

889
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,107
<font color="yellow">- Think of him as a stranger.
- Bye.</font>

890
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:46,367
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, the film will become a hit.</font>

891
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,096
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, good luck with your love life.</font>

892
00:43:48,097 --> 00:43:50,097
<font color="yellow">- I said I'm not interested.
- Hey, what about me?</font>

893
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:52,797
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you on social media.
- Sweet!</font>

894
00:43:52,937 --> 00:43:53,937
<font color="yellow">Bye, guys!</font>

895
00:43:58,697 --> 00:43:59,697
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

896
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:04,267
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

897
00:44:04,967 --> 00:44:06,467
<font color="yellow">she's also interested in Young Bin.</font>

898
00:44:06,837 --> 00:44:08,296
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about?
- What's with you?</font>

899
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:11,067
<font color="yellow">You've been quiet all night.
What's with this nonsense now?</font>

900
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:12,597
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so slow-witted.</font>

901
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:15,357
<font color="yellow">Then why did she make time out
of her busy schedule to see you?</font>

902
00:44:15,567 --> 00:44:16,667
<font color="yellow">Because we're friends.</font>

903
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:19,637
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's go.</font>

904
00:44:24,797 --> 00:44:27,297
<font color="yellow">Hey, men and women can't be friends.</font>

905
00:44:27,967 --> 00:44:29,607
<font color="yellow">I think Young Bin and So Hee will go out.</font>

906
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:33,167
<font color="yellow">Do you think you've become
a fortune teller or what?</font>

907
00:44:33,797 --> 00:44:35,237
<font color="yellow">You don't stand a chance with Ji An.</font>

908
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:36,897
<font color="yellow">She's way out of your league.</font>

909
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:38,797
<font color="yellow">Hey, that was mean.</font>

910
00:44:38,897 --> 00:44:40,466
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. That was similar.</font>

911
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,747
<font color="yellow">- Didn't I sound like him?
- No.</font>

912
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:42,967
<font color="yellow">Wasn't I close?</font>

913
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:44,987
<font color="yellow">- I think I was pretty good.
- I don't think so.</font>

914
00:45:11,837 --> 00:45:13,637
<font color="yellow">- Gosh! Who are you?
- Hey.</font>

915
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,837
<font color="yellow">Keep it down. You'll wake Turtle up.</font>

916
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:19,967
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

917
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:24,267
<font color="yellow">You startled me. What are you doing now?</font>

918
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:27,337
<font color="yellow">- You weren't sleeping?
- No. Come on out.</font>

919
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:31,897
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, that lunatic.
- Be quiet.</font>

920
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:36,067
<font color="yellow">I thought I was seeing a ghost.
My goodness.</font>

921
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,067
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

922
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,397
<font color="yellow">What time is it now?</font>

923
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:45,267
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you startled me.</font>

924
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:49,137
<font color="yellow">What time is it now?</font>

925
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,097
<font color="yellow">Around 5am.</font>

926
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:53,267
<font color="yellow">What's that eye mask for?</font>

927
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:57,967
<font color="yellow">Turtle broadcasts his shows on
the internet until very late.</font>

928
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:00,997
<font color="yellow">Did you go out?</font>

929
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:03,037
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

930
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,187
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep, so I went for a run.</font>

931
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:09,737
<font color="yellow">Even guys have to be careful being
outside alone at this hour.</font>

932
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:12,697
<font color="yellow">What's up by the way?</font>

933
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:15,437
<font color="yellow">I thought about it,</font>

934
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:17,927
<font color="yellow">and I think I still want to do it.</font>

935
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:19,137
<font color="yellow">That sounds weird.</font>

936
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:22,336
<font color="yellow">You want to do it? What is it? With me?</font>

937
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:23,697
<font color="yellow">You psycho. Why are you...</font>

938
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:26,027
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking? Are
you still half asleep?</font>

939
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:28,597
<font color="yellow">- It's about "War Terminator".
- What?</font>

940
00:46:29,797 --> 00:46:32,967
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing it up again?
Is it because of So Hee?</font>

941
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:34,697
<font color="yellow">No, it's not because of her.</font>

942
00:46:36,697 --> 00:46:38,367
<font color="yellow">I don't think I should give up like this.</font>

943
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,367
<font color="yellow">I haven't even met the director.
That's what bothers me.</font>

944
00:46:43,297 --> 00:46:45,367
<font color="yellow">I saw the director while following Mr.
Kim around.</font>

945
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:46,967
<font color="yellow">But it's...</font>

946
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:50,167
<font color="yellow">Just forget it. It's impossible.</font>

947
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,737
<font color="yellow">Plus, it made me want to quit.</font>

948
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,767
<font color="yellow">What was that about? Why do you
have to be treated like that?</font>

949
00:46:57,497 --> 00:46:58,497
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right?</font>

950
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,066
<font color="yellow">Aren't you an actor? You are.
That was ridiculous.</font>

951
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:02,067
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

952
00:47:03,537 --> 00:47:05,937
<font color="yellow">I'm not used to getting
compliments from you.</font>

953
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:07,567
<font color="yellow">I'm speaking the truth.</font>

954
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,867
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

955
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:13,337
<font color="yellow">I want to give it a try.</font>

956
00:47:14,967 --> 00:47:17,837
<font color="yellow">Frankly, I'd love an opportunity
to be auditioned. I'm serious.</font>

957
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,467
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second. Let me think.</font>

958
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,567
<font color="yellow">So Hee said that listening to the
director got her all excited.</font>

959
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:30,767
<font color="yellow">Hearing that got me excited, too.</font>

960
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:33,967
<font color="yellow">I don't even know.</font>

961
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:35,767
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

962
00:47:36,967 --> 00:47:40,267
<font color="yellow">So just one meeting with the
director is good enough, right?</font>

963
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,097
<font color="yellow">Yes. How will you arrange it?</font>

964
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:43,997
<font color="yellow">That I don't know.</font>

965
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,948
<font color="yellow">- Hey, what are you talking about?
- What's your problem?</font>

966
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:50,337
<font color="yellow">You're such an incompetent manager.</font>

967
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:54,067
<font color="yellow">I should've gone to work
for Kim Soo Hyun...</font>

968
00:47:54,597 --> 00:47:56,357
<font color="yellow">or become friends with Yoo Ah In.
This is...</font>

969
00:47:56,467 --> 00:48:00,497
<font color="yellow">My mom told me not to hang out with you.
I should've listened to her.</font>

970
00:48:00,867 --> 00:48:02,967
<font color="yellow">Look into it. Try to think of a way.</font>

971
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,497
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What's that sound?</font>

972
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,597
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

973
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:13,767
<font color="yellow">Are you not sleeping?</font>

974
00:48:14,937 --> 00:48:16,897
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep. I have too much energy.</font>

975
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:19,337
<font color="yellow">It's about to explode.</font>

976
00:48:20,637 --> 00:48:23,037
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Working out
like this will tame it, right?</font>

977
00:48:23,337 --> 00:48:25,267
<font color="yellow">He has lost his mind. Let's go.</font>

978
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:29,767
<font color="yellow">Don't go. Guys!</font>

979
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:32,297
<font color="yellow">Help me!</font>

980
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:37,668
<font color="yellow">Hey, this car makes me nervous.
Drive carefully.</font>

981
00:48:38,398 --> 00:48:42,268
<font color="yellow">Then you shouldn't have
let Turtle take your car.</font>

982
00:48:42,368 --> 00:48:44,328
<font color="yellow">I let him use it because
he's going to the shoot.</font>

983
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:47,468
<font color="yellow">Will we really be able to meet
the director at Cinematheque?</font>

984
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,568
<font color="yellow">I heard that Directors Yim Pil Sung
and Lee Joon Ik go there a lot.</font>

985
00:48:52,038 --> 00:48:53,868
<font color="yellow">We'll wait until he shows up.</font>

986
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:56,774
<font color="yellow">Right. We have so much time on our hands.</font>

987
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:57,798
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

988
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,438
<font color="yellow">It's Mr. Ahn. Why is he calling me?</font>

989
00:49:05,438 --> 00:49:07,238
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Mr. Ahn.
- Young Bin?</font>

990
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:09,568
<font color="yellow">- Give me your address.
- Pardon me?</font>

991
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:12,468
<font color="yellow">Why do you need my address?</font>

992
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:16,438
<font color="yellow">I went fishing and caught so many
octopuses. I want to send you some.</font>

993
00:49:16,898 --> 00:49:19,868
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. No one is home anyway.</font>

994
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,068
<font color="yellow">Really? Then I will send them to Eun...</font>

995
00:49:22,538 --> 00:49:24,837
<font color="yellow">I mean, I'll send them to Mr. Kim's office.</font>

996
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:26,438
<font color="yellow">Pick up the package before they go bad.</font>

997
00:49:26,538 --> 00:49:28,468
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will. Thank you.</font>

998
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:29,568
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

999
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,437
<font color="yellow">He'll send me small octopus.</font>

1000
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:34,438
<font color="yellow">Small octopus?</font>

1001
00:49:39,198 --> 00:49:40,968
<font color="yellow">I feel like we're backstabbing him.</font>

1002
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:43,568
<font color="yellow">- I don't like this feeling.
- I know.</font>

1003
00:49:46,768 --> 00:49:48,668
<font color="yellow">I should tell him that I
can't be in that film.</font>

1004
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:54,238
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Don't go too far.</font>

1005
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:56,568
<font color="yellow">You must be kidding, but that's too much.</font>

1006
00:49:57,068 --> 00:49:58,908
<font color="yellow">- Frankly, I didn't want to do it.
- Goodness.</font>

1007
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,168
<font color="yellow">Then why did you agree to it?</font>

1008
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:06,868
<font color="yellow">I guess I decided thoughtlessly
because I felt empty.</font>

1009
00:50:07,038 --> 00:50:08,244
<font color="yellow">And you said the script is well written.</font>

1010
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:10,228
<font color="yellow">So you're going to tell
him that you won't do it?</font>

1011
00:50:12,538 --> 00:50:15,668
<font color="yellow">You can meet the director,
but that film is...</font>

1012
00:50:16,098 --> 00:50:18,498
<font color="yellow">- You have to do it.
- No, I can't.</font>

1013
00:50:19,538 --> 00:50:21,398
<font color="yellow">- I won't do it.
- Well, I...</font>

1014
00:50:21,798 --> 00:50:23,468
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I didn't hear anything.</font>

1015
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:25,408
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do, then?</font>

1016
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:30,998
<font color="yellow">You're so extreme.</font>

1017
00:50:33,568 --> 00:50:34,638
<font color="yellow">Excuse me for a second.</font>

1018
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:37,698
<font color="yellow"><i>(YOUNG BIN)</i></font>

1019
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,768
<font color="yellow">Hey, Young Bin. What's up?</font>

1020
00:50:39,868 --> 00:50:41,437
<font color="yellow">- Eun Gab, are you busy?
- I'm in a meeting,</font>

1021
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,938
<font color="yellow">but I can talk to you.</font>

1022
00:50:43,198 --> 00:50:45,638
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to meet Mr. Lee Joon Ik.
- Who?</font>

1023
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:46,898
<font color="yellow">Is it Mr. Kim?</font>

1024
00:50:46,998 --> 00:50:49,298
<font color="yellow">- Whom are you meeting?
- On that note,</font>

1025
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:52,068
<font color="yellow">I think I should say no
to the detective film.</font>

1026
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:54,538
<font color="yellow">Gosh, is today April Fool's Day or what?</font>

1027
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:56,138
<font color="yellow">Is Ho Jin with you?</font>

1028
00:50:56,868 --> 00:50:57,868
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

1029
00:50:58,068 --> 00:51:01,098
<font color="yellow">- Please go ahead.
- Is Young Bin serious?</font>

1030
00:51:04,668 --> 00:51:06,038
<font color="yellow">- Yes, he is.
- Hey!</font>

1031
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,538
<font color="yellow">I'm sick and tired of...</font>

1032
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:11,098
<font color="yellow">- actors changing their minds.
- Mr. Kim...</font>

1033
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:14,298
<font color="yellow">- How can you encourage him?
- Mr. Kim...</font>

1034
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:18,067
<font color="yellow">Hey, he's obviously out
of his mind right now.</font>

1035
00:51:18,068 --> 00:51:20,298
<font color="yellow">- Sir, you're on speakerphone now.
- What?</font>

1036
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:24,738
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, I wasn't badmouthing you.</font>

1037
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:27,538
<font color="yellow">I know. I'm sorry.</font>

1038
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:31,338
<font color="yellow">Then go ahead and meet
the director if you can.</font>

1039
00:51:31,598 --> 00:51:34,398
<font color="yellow">But let's keep this film
as an option, okay?</font>

1040
00:51:34,598 --> 00:51:35,598
<font color="yellow">I don't want to.</font>

1041
00:51:36,068 --> 00:51:37,308
<font color="yellow">That'll make me look dishonest.</font>

1042
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:39,068
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's...</font>

1043
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:42,337
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's say you went clubbing.</font>

1044
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:43,698
<font color="yellow">A girl starts talking to you.</font>

1045
00:51:43,998 --> 00:51:47,898
<font color="yellow">Then will you call your girlfriend
right away and break up with her?</font>

1046
00:51:48,198 --> 00:51:50,968
<font color="yellow">Cup Noodles. Help me out if you're there!
You idiot...</font>

1047
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:53,098
<font color="yellow">- Cup Noodles!
- I'm here.</font>

1048
00:51:53,968 --> 00:51:55,668
<font color="yellow">I'll pick the next film.</font>

1049
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:57,208
<font color="yellow">I want to take my time with it.</font>

1050
00:51:57,768 --> 00:52:00,288
<font color="yellow">I don't think rushing into a
decision like this is a good idea.</font>

1051
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:02,567
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you want to see me dead or what?</font>

1052
00:52:02,568 --> 00:52:04,408
<font color="yellow">I told you about Mr. Ahn's
flying kick, right?</font>

1053
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,938
<font color="yellow">- He'll seriously kill me.
- I'm sorry, Eun Gab.</font>

1054
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:08,798
<font color="yellow">Sort it out for me.</font>

1055
00:52:10,098 --> 00:52:12,097
<font color="yellow">I think you should tell
him sooner than later.</font>

1056
00:52:12,098 --> 00:52:14,838
<font color="yellow">He said he's sending small
octopus to your office for me.</font>

1057
00:52:15,038 --> 00:52:16,468
<font color="yellow">What? Small octopus?</font>

1058
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:25,198
<font color="yellow">Hey, he's calling.
I'll call you back later.</font>

1059
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:28,937
<font color="yellow">- Oh, dear.
- Mr. Kim, what about the meeting?</font>

1060
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:31,268
<font color="yellow">Gosh, be quiet! Everyone, stay still.</font>

1061
00:52:31,438 --> 00:52:32,468
<font color="yellow">Don't say a word.</font>

1062
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:39,298
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Ahn.</font>

1063
00:52:40,238 --> 00:52:41,238
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1064
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,438
<font color="yellow">Small octopus? I see.</font>

1065
00:52:43,498 --> 00:52:44,698
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Well...</font>

1066
00:52:45,468 --> 00:52:47,668
<font color="yellow">I actually have something to tell you.</font>

1067
00:52:48,238 --> 00:52:50,838
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please calm down first.</font>

1068
00:52:53,098 --> 00:52:54,098
<font color="yellow">It's about...</font>

1069
00:52:56,198 --> 00:52:57,238
<font color="yellow">Young Bin...</font>

1070
00:52:57,998 --> 00:52:59,768
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Eun Gab!</font>

1071
00:53:04,668 --> 00:53:06,968
<font color="yellow">Hey, where is Kim Eun Gab?</font>

1072
00:53:07,498 --> 00:53:09,598
<font color="yellow">- This prick.
- Hello, Mr. Ahn.</font>

1073
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:12,368
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- Hey, where is Kim Eun Gab?</font>

1074
00:53:12,938 --> 00:53:14,968
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim was here...
- Where is he now?</font>

1075
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:16,967
<font color="yellow">He left a little while ago.</font>

1076
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:18,668
<font color="yellow">I know that he's here!</font>

1077
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:20,938
<font color="yellow">- He's really not here.
- Don't lie to my face.</font>

1078
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:23,768
<font color="yellow">You, Kim Eun Gab! You better come out!</font>

1079
00:53:24,138 --> 00:53:25,138
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

1080
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:28,138
<font color="yellow">- Can I help you?
- What are you?</font>

1081
00:53:28,168 --> 00:53:30,698
<font color="yellow">Where's Kim Eun Gab?</font>

1082
00:53:31,238 --> 00:53:33,038
<font color="yellow">How dare he does this to me again?</font>

1083
00:53:33,138 --> 00:53:34,838
<font color="yellow">He's not available right now.</font>

1084
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:37,268
<font color="yellow">I doubt that. Get out of my way.</font>

1085
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:39,068
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

1086
00:53:42,438 --> 00:53:43,538
<font color="yellow">Kim Eun Gab!</font>

1087
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:48,838
<font color="yellow">Stop him.</font>

1088
00:53:49,098 --> 00:53:50,998
<font color="yellow">I said stop him.</font>

1089
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:57,898
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

1090
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,468
<font color="yellow">Excuse me,</font>

1091
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,368
<font color="yellow">but I heard Mr. Lee Joon
Ik comes here often.</font>

1092
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:05,398
<font color="yellow">He does.</font>

1093
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:07,098
<font color="yellow">Can you maybe...</font>

1094
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:11,298
<font color="yellow">give me a call next time he comes around?</font>

1095
00:54:11,338 --> 00:54:12,438
<font color="yellow">This is my business card.</font>

1096
00:54:12,468 --> 00:54:13,538
<font color="yellow"><i>(LEE HO JIN)</i></font>

1097
00:54:14,438 --> 00:54:16,497
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I don't have ill intentions.</font>

1098
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:18,468
<font color="yellow">- Can you do us a favor?
- That scared me.</font>

1099
00:54:19,398 --> 00:54:21,198
<font color="yellow">Please. It's an urgent matter.</font>

1100
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:23,268
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

1101
00:54:23,698 --> 00:54:25,668
<font color="yellow">Can I get your autograph in exchange?</font>

1102
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,337
<font color="yellow">Of course. Give me a pen.</font>

1103
00:54:27,338 --> 00:54:30,298
<font color="yellow">I'm a big fan. My gosh.</font>

1104
00:54:35,668 --> 00:54:36,668
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1105
00:54:37,338 --> 00:54:39,638
<font color="yellow">- My number's on there.
- Thank you.</font>

1106
00:54:39,738 --> 00:54:40,738
<font color="yellow">Please let me know.</font>

1107
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:41,868
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1108
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:45,168
<font color="yellow">Young Bin.</font>

1109
00:54:45,968 --> 00:54:47,038
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous.</font>

1110
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:49,138
<font color="yellow">You should become an actor, too.</font>

1111
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:52,578
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do now?
Should we go somewhere else?</font>

1112
00:54:54,398 --> 00:54:55,998
<font color="yellow">Let's watch a movie now that we're here.</font>

1113
00:54:56,198 --> 00:54:57,298
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1114
00:54:59,038 --> 00:55:00,068
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

1115
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:02,238
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

1116
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,768
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get
your hands off of me.</font>

1117
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:09,668
<font color="yellow">Can't you read?</font>

1118
00:55:10,338 --> 00:55:12,298
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to hug her.
I have to practice this.</font>

1119
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:16,068
<font color="yellow">You don't even have that many lines.
Why do you need to practice?</font>

1120
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:17,938
<font color="yellow">Continue.</font>

1121
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,768
<font color="yellow">- What was the line again?
- Are you a goldfish?</font>

1122
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:32,538
<font color="yellow">You're like that guy from the movie
who was wearing a fish mask.</font>

1123
00:55:32,838 --> 00:55:34,968
<font color="yellow">- Why can't you memorize these?
- I'm nervous.</font>

1124
00:55:35,038 --> 00:55:36,998
<font color="yellow">Why am I so nervous?</font>

1125
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:38,798
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1126
00:55:41,868 --> 00:55:43,838
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Don't worry.</font>

1127
00:55:44,668 --> 00:55:45,867
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm here.</font>

1128
00:55:45,868 --> 00:55:48,998
<font color="yellow">Do not worry. I am here.</font>

1129
00:55:49,238 --> 00:55:51,038
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm here.</font>

1130
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:54,067
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm here.</font>

1131
00:55:54,068 --> 00:55:55,428
<font color="yellow">You didn't get any sleep, did you?</font>

1132
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:56,568
<font color="yellow">You look so old.</font>

1133
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:58,898
<font color="yellow">I couldn't get any sleep
because of my man energy.</font>

1134
00:55:59,598 --> 00:56:00,638
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean.</font>

1135
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,038
<font color="yellow">I pictured it in my head.
I have to go throw up now.</font>

1136
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,568
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

1137
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:15,038
<font color="yellow">Look over there.</font>

1138
00:56:20,638 --> 00:56:21,698
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

1139
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:23,738
<font color="yellow">You're here early.</font>

1140
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:25,898
<font color="yellow">I think it's a must-have
virtue as an actor.</font>

1141
00:56:26,468 --> 00:56:29,568
<font color="yellow">This is Cha Joon. Cha Young
Bin's cousin brother.</font>

1142
00:56:30,398 --> 00:56:31,998
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

1143
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:34,144
<font color="yellow">I'm a big fan. I have so
much respect for you.</font>

1144
00:56:34,168 --> 00:56:36,668
<font color="yellow">- All right. I'll see you in a bit.
- Yes.</font>

1145
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:39,814
<font color="yellow">It's not a complicated scene.
Don't get too nervous.</font>

1146
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:41,968
<font color="yellow">Didn't you get any sleep?</font>

1147
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,308
<font color="yellow">I stayed up all night intentionally.</font>

1148
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:48,608
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make myself look
like the worried character.</font>

1149
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,768
<font color="yellow">I like that.</font>

1150
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:53,198
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1151
00:56:55,338 --> 00:56:56,368
<font color="yellow">That was...</font>

1152
00:56:57,798 --> 00:56:58,968
<font color="yellow">really Jin Jae Young.</font>

1153
00:56:59,698 --> 00:57:01,068
<font color="yellow">Look at that body.</font>

1154
00:57:01,438 --> 00:57:02,598
<font color="yellow">She used to be my dream girl.</font>

1155
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:05,838
<font color="yellow">You get to hug her.</font>

1156
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:07,498
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous.</font>

1157
00:57:08,598 --> 00:57:10,237
<font color="yellow">Not really. She's much older.</font>

1158
00:57:10,238 --> 00:57:12,668
<font color="yellow">She's still beautiful.</font>

1159
00:57:13,968 --> 00:57:16,368
<font color="yellow">But I won't let that get in the way.
I'm a professional.</font>

1160
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:18,768
<font color="yellow">I'm going to focus on the role I'm playing.</font>

1161
00:57:19,768 --> 00:57:20,968
<font color="yellow">What do you know about acting?</font>

1162
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:24,138
<font color="yellow">Focus.</font>

1163
00:57:24,668 --> 00:57:25,668
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

1164
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:28,968
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1165
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:47,798
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

1166
00:57:49,038 --> 00:57:50,038
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

1167
00:57:50,698 --> 00:57:51,698
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

1168
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:55,238
<font color="yellow">That's your blood-related sister.
Stop looking at her like that.</font>

1169
00:57:57,498 --> 00:58:00,868
<font color="yellow">This is how I always look at people.
I get that a lot.</font>

1170
00:58:02,138 --> 00:58:03,898
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

1171
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,168
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's start from the top.</font>

1172
00:58:06,368 --> 00:58:07,968
<font color="yellow">Let's go again. Ready.</font>

1173
00:58:10,638 --> 00:58:11,638
<font color="yellow">Action.</font>

1174
00:58:17,098 --> 00:58:18,168
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

1175
00:58:19,468 --> 00:58:21,368
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm fine.</font>

1176
00:58:27,198 --> 00:58:28,198
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

1177
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:31,498
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

1178
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:01,438
<font color="yellow">Can I have a word?</font>

1179
00:59:11,698 --> 00:59:13,038
<font color="yellow">I can't do this.</font>

1180
00:59:13,498 --> 00:59:14,538
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

1181
00:59:17,438 --> 00:59:18,638
<font color="yellow">He has an erection.</font>

1182
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:27,298
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1183
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:29,838
<font color="yellow">My man energy won't go away.</font>

1184
00:59:37,368 --> 00:59:38,368
<font color="yellow">One more?</font>

1185
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:40,438
<font color="yellow">That's enough for today.</font>

1186
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:42,698
<font color="yellow">My eyes are so sore.</font>

1187
00:59:43,468 --> 00:59:45,708
<font color="yellow">Me, too. This is my first time
doing this since college.</font>

1188
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:47,998
<font color="yellow">- Is he coming today?
- Hello?</font>

1189
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:50,068
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Joon Ik is here.</font>

1190
00:59:50,498 --> 00:59:51,498
<font color="yellow">Over there.</font>

1191
00:59:54,768 --> 00:59:55,768
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1192
00:59:56,298 --> 00:59:57,298
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1193
00:59:58,338 --> 00:59:59,968
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

1194
01:00:10,168 --> 01:00:12,088
<font color="yellow">The last time I saw this
movie was 10 years ago.</font>

1195
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:16,768
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember this movie?</font>

1196
01:00:22,938 --> 01:00:23,998
<font color="yellow">What do we do now?</font>

1197
01:00:24,168 --> 01:00:26,638
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Let's wait
until this finishes.</font>

1198
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:34,138
<font color="yellow">I feel like a kid waiting to ask
out a girl I have a crush on.</font>

1199
01:00:34,338 --> 01:00:37,198
<font color="yellow">I feel like when I realized
my mom opened my porn folder.</font>

1200
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:39,198
<font color="yellow">I'm so nervous right now.</font>

1201
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:43,498
<font color="yellow">How many movies are we watching today?</font>

1202
01:00:43,868 --> 01:00:45,368
<font color="yellow">We finally met him, though.</font>

1203
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:07,668
<font color="yellow">It's over.</font>

1204
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,198
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- I feel bad.</font>

1205
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:20,968
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1206
01:01:21,398 --> 01:01:24,038
<font color="yellow">There he goes. He's leaving.</font>

1207
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:32,538
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee.
- Mr. Lee.</font>

1208
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:35,068
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

1209
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:37,768
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm an actor, Cha Young Bin.</font>

1210
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:39,538
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Ho Jin, his manager.</font>

1211
01:01:40,268 --> 01:01:42,148
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.
Are you here to watch movies?</font>

1212
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:45,367
<font color="yellow">We're here to see you actually.</font>

1213
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,938
<font color="yellow">- Me?
- For "War Terminator".</font>

1214
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:49,138
<font color="yellow">Oh, that.</font>

1215
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:53,637
<font color="yellow">I already talked with
the agency about that.</font>

1216
01:01:53,638 --> 01:01:54,868
<font color="yellow">We know that.</font>

1217
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:58,738
<font color="yellow">But we had something to
say to you in person.</font>

1218
01:01:59,468 --> 01:02:01,268
<font color="yellow">Can you make some time for us?</font>

1219
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:02,598
<font color="yellow">Time?</font>

1220
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:06,088
<font color="yellow">You know around the place, right?</font>

1221
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:08,058
<font color="yellow">I can walk around with my eyes closed.</font>

1222
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:11,638
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1223
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:15,498
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Kim?</font>

1224
01:02:16,168 --> 01:02:17,848
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now? Did you meet him?</font>

1225
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,598
<font color="yellow">We did.</font>

1226
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:22,048
<font color="yellow">But we didn't get to talk
about anything in details.</font>

1227
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:24,598
<font color="yellow">What about Mr. Ahn?</font>

1228
01:02:24,898 --> 01:02:27,468
<font color="yellow">Don't even get me started.</font>

1229
01:02:28,898 --> 01:02:31,197
<font color="yellow">He came looking for me
here saying he'll kill me.</font>

1230
01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:32,868
<font color="yellow">I'm hiding from him right now.</font>

1231
01:02:33,568 --> 01:02:36,937
<font color="yellow">I thought he was some kind of loan shark.</font>

1232
01:02:36,938 --> 01:02:39,068
<font color="yellow">He's going to look everywhere
until he finds me.</font>

1233
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:42,298
<font color="yellow">By the way, what did he say?</font>

1234
01:02:42,498 --> 01:02:45,178
<font color="yellow">He said he has an appointment, so
we're meeting him somewhere else.</font>

1235
01:02:46,268 --> 01:02:47,298
<font color="yellow">Where's that?</font>

1236
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:48,998
<font color="yellow"><i>(WELCOME)</i></font>

1237
01:02:59,368 --> 01:03:00,468
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

1238
01:03:05,938 --> 01:03:06,938
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

1239
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:09,138
<font color="yellow">- Cheers.
- Congratulations.</font>

1240
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:15,298
<font color="yellow">This place isn't exactly
where we can talk about it.</font>

1241
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,438
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

1242
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:18,968
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Eun Gab.</font>

1243
01:03:19,168 --> 01:03:21,067
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Are you meeting him with us?</font>

1244
01:03:21,068 --> 01:03:23,298
<font color="yellow">No. You guys go ahead. I
was just feeling uneasy.</font>

1245
01:03:23,438 --> 01:03:25,814
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many people here in
a wrap party for a movie premiere?</font>

1246
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:27,174
<font color="yellow">And they say the movie
industry is in recession.</font>

1247
01:03:27,198 --> 01:03:28,938
<font color="yellow">Look at all these freeloaders.</font>

1248
01:03:28,968 --> 01:03:29,968
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

1249
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:33,698
<font color="yellow">This place is so crowded. I
wonder how we're going to talk.</font>

1250
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:35,868
<font color="yellow">Just go up to him.</font>

1251
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:38,067
<font color="yellow">I'll be sitting over there.</font>

1252
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:39,938
<font color="yellow">Don't tell him that I'm here, okay?</font>

1253
01:03:44,368 --> 01:03:45,568
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- All right.</font>

1254
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:48,197
<font color="yellow"><i>(WRAP PARTY)</i></font>

1255
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:49,868
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

1256
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:51,598
<font color="yellow">They're here.</font>

1257
01:03:51,968 --> 01:03:54,098
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Mr. Lee.
- You're here.</font>

1258
01:03:55,368 --> 01:03:56,798
<font color="yellow">What were you saying?</font>

1259
01:03:57,238 --> 01:04:00,068
<font color="yellow"><i>(WRAP PARTY)</i></font>

1260
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:04,038
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.</font>

1261
01:04:06,698 --> 01:04:08,968
<font color="yellow">I already kept you waiting
watching that boring movie.</font>

1262
01:04:09,368 --> 01:04:11,168
<font color="yellow">I slept through the whole thing.</font>

1263
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,298
<font color="yellow">I've already seen "Nostalghia"
a dozen times since college.</font>

1264
01:04:14,598 --> 01:04:16,138
<font color="yellow">- You did?
- He did.</font>

1265
01:04:16,298 --> 01:04:19,538
<font color="yellow">Young Bin loves movies
directed by Tarkovsky.</font>

1266
01:04:20,468 --> 01:04:22,468
<font color="yellow">Tarkovsky movies? Which ones?</font>

1267
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:25,268
<font color="yellow">I like "Nostalghia", but I
like "The Sacrifice" better.</font>

1268
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:27,837
<font color="yellow">That movie goes on for
more than four hours.</font>

1269
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:29,097
<font color="yellow">- He likes it.
- You watched all that?</font>

1270
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,168
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

1271
01:04:30,568 --> 01:04:32,768
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- We watched a dozen times.</font>

1272
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:44,798
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1273
01:04:46,068 --> 01:04:48,368
<font color="yellow">Why are Mr. Lee Joon Ik and
Cha Young Bin together?</font>

1274
01:04:48,698 --> 01:04:50,244
<font color="yellow">I thought he wasn't going
to be on "War Terminator".</font>

1275
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,444
<font color="yellow">Pretend you didn't see anything.
What are you doing here anyway?</font>

1276
01:04:52,468 --> 01:04:54,167
<font color="yellow">Go look after your kid when
you're finished from work.</font>

1277
01:04:54,168 --> 01:04:56,298
<font color="yellow">Are you looking for a date here?</font>

1278
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:58,998
<font color="yellow">- I invested in this movie.
- I knew it.</font>

1279
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,768
<font color="yellow">No wonder it's such a mess.
The casting is a train wreck.</font>

1280
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:03,414
<font color="yellow">I already know it's going to be a flop.</font>

1281
01:05:03,438 --> 01:05:06,298
<font color="yellow">Why are you always like that when
people don't cast your actors?</font>

1282
01:05:06,568 --> 01:05:09,468
<font color="yellow">When you say that, the movies
turn out to be mega hits.</font>

1283
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:12,768
<font color="yellow">Go away. I'm worried he'll notice me.</font>

1284
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:15,298
<font color="yellow">What are you intending to do?</font>

1285
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:17,198
<font color="yellow">This is getting interesting.</font>

1286
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:21,768
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I feel like I'm
spying on my cheating wife.</font>

1287
01:05:25,038 --> 01:05:26,168
<font color="yellow">I wish this movie's a hit.</font>

1288
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:27,838
<font color="yellow">Get away from me.</font>

1289
01:05:31,238 --> 01:05:32,238
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

1290
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:36,938
<font color="yellow">We heard that you already have
an actor in mind for the role.</font>

1291
01:05:37,338 --> 01:05:38,568
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

1292
01:05:40,338 --> 01:05:41,698
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

1293
01:05:42,368 --> 01:05:44,668
<font color="yellow">but can you maybe reconsider
with Young Bin in mind?</font>

1294
01:05:45,598 --> 01:05:49,268
<font color="yellow">I'd like to do a script read
with other actors if I can.</font>

1295
01:05:49,698 --> 01:05:51,398
<font color="yellow">I don't understand...</font>

1296
01:05:51,938 --> 01:05:53,468
<font color="yellow">why you desperately want this movie.</font>

1297
01:05:56,738 --> 01:05:58,398
<font color="yellow">What's the reason for...</font>

1298
01:05:59,768 --> 01:06:01,468
<font color="yellow">making you want to do this so badly?</font>

1299
01:06:03,398 --> 01:06:04,468
<font color="yellow">It's because of you.</font>

1300
01:06:05,198 --> 01:06:06,198
<font color="yellow">Because of me?</font>

1301
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,338
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1302
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:11,638
<font color="yellow">Please reconsider.</font>

1303
01:06:13,338 --> 01:06:15,698
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee.
- Hello.</font>

1304
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:17,967
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

1305
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:20,298
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin, long time no see.
- Hello.</font>

1306
01:06:21,498 --> 01:06:24,138
<font color="yellow">I saw "The Flowers of Evil". You were good.</font>

1307
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:25,538
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1308
01:06:27,238 --> 01:06:29,967
<font color="yellow">I read the news article that you'll
be working with Mr. Lee Joon Ik.</font>

1309
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:30,968
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1310
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:33,297
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

1311
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:34,298
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1312
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,968
<font color="yellow">This is a misunderstanding.</font>

1313
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:40,368
<font color="yellow">I'm just here to discuss something.</font>

1314
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43,998
<font color="yellow">I have customers to attend to.
I'll talk to you later.</font>

1315
01:06:46,938 --> 01:06:47,938
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

1316
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:51,168
<font color="yellow">He got it all wrong.</font>

1317
01:06:52,568 --> 01:06:53,568
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

1318
01:06:56,098 --> 01:06:57,098
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

1319
01:07:11,538 --> 01:07:12,998
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

1320
01:07:16,268 --> 01:07:17,338
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1321
01:07:19,868 --> 01:07:20,868
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1322
01:07:43,368 --> 01:07:44,468
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ahn?</font>

1323
01:07:44,668 --> 01:07:46,538
<font color="yellow">You're here to see me, right? Let's talk.</font>

1324
01:07:46,638 --> 01:07:48,298
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me.
- Gosh.</font>

1325
01:07:49,068 --> 01:07:52,197
<font color="yellow">You jerks are trying to stab
me in the back. Is that right?</font>

1326
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:54,908
<font color="yellow">Stop making a scene. Let's talk outside.</font>

1327
01:07:54,998 --> 01:07:56,797
<font color="yellow">Let's take this outside.</font>

1328
01:07:56,798 --> 01:07:57,908
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

1329
01:07:58,468 --> 01:08:00,338
<font color="yellow">You're the worst of all.</font>

1330
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:25,738
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

1331
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:28,538
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

1332
01:08:29,098 --> 01:08:30,338
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

1333
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:32,958
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right?
- Of course.</font>

1334
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:36,638
<font color="yellow">It's fine really.</font>

1335
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:38,998
<font color="yellow">Do I smell bad?</font>

1336
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:40,068
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

1337
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:42,198
<font color="yellow">- Do I?
- Yes.</font>

1338
01:08:43,638 --> 01:08:44,868
<font color="yellow">Did Mr. Ahn leave?</font>

1339
01:08:46,098 --> 01:08:47,768
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't believe what he said...</font>

1340
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:50,298
<font color="yellow">about my unborn grandchildren.</font>

1341
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:52,938
<font color="yellow">I don't think he's that
upset any more, though.</font>

1342
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:55,468
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me. Go back to Mr. Lee.</font>

1343
01:08:56,168 --> 01:08:57,268
<font color="yellow">We're done talking.</font>

1344
01:08:58,098 --> 01:08:59,198
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

1345
01:08:59,868 --> 01:09:02,108
<font color="yellow">It didn't work out. He told
us to wait for another time.</font>

1346
01:09:03,468 --> 01:09:04,468
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1347
01:09:05,968 --> 01:09:08,738
<font color="yellow">It's fine. We tried our best.</font>

1348
01:09:09,268 --> 01:09:11,698
<font color="yellow">We tried everything we possibly could.
What's done is done.</font>

1350
01:09:15,168 --> 01:09:17,568
<font color="yellow">It's just like forgetting
your girl after a breakup.</font>

1351
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,968
<font color="yellow">I understand. We have to start fresh.</font>

Will you take responsibility?</font>

1361

1379
01:11:21,768 --> 01:11:22,944

- What's going on?</font>

1385

<font color="yellow">Young Bin?</font>

1386
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:45,737
<font color="yellow">Is he sleeping over at
his girlfriend's house?</font>

1387
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:47,568
<font color="yellow">You know he doesn't have one.</font>

1388
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:49,308
<font color="yellow">You don't know anything for certain.</font>

1389
01:11:49,368 --> 01:11:51,797

- Young Bin.</font>

- Right.</font>

1398

<font color="yellow">I'll put him on right now.</font>

1403
01:12:24,668 --> 01:12:26,908

- Who is it?</font>

1404
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:30,638
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- I hope this isn't a bad time.</font>
