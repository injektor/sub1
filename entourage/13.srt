<font color="yellow">(Entourage)</font>

3
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:20,516
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

4
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:26,276
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

5
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:30,146
<font color="yellow">Keep your rods high up.</font>

6
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,716
<font color="yellow">Like that. There you go.</font>

7
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,676
<font color="yellow">Is this really necessary?</font>

8
00:00:34,716 --> 00:00:38,016
<font color="yellow">You need some practice beforehand. Fishing is not easy.</font>

9
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,276
<font color="yellow">We don't have to go sea fishing.</font>

10
00:00:40,478 --> 00:00:42,818
<font color="yellow">We should celebrate working on "Lim Hwa Su" together.</font>

11
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,008
<font color="yellow">It'll be fun. I already borrowed a boat, too.</font>

12
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:49,748
<font color="yellow">Now that we're on the same boat, why don't we get on a real boat?</font>

13
00:00:50,248 --> 00:00:53,648
<font color="yellow">A while ago, you were on Ok Ja's side and didn't want the movie.</font>

14
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,648
<font color="yellow">Back then, I didn't know you'd bring Young Bin.</font>

15
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:01,708
<font color="yellow">Also, you've gone behind my back many times.</font>

16
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:03,278
<font color="yellow">Let's say we're even now.</font>

17
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:06,708
<font color="yellow">- We're even. - Fine.</font>

18
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,548
<font color="yellow">Let's work hard and make some progress.</font>

19
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:11,808
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

20
00:01:13,178 --> 00:01:16,108
<font color="yellow">By the way, don't we know who will direct the movie yet?</font>

21
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:18,378
<font color="yellow">The dramatization process has already begun.</font>

22
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:19,908
<font color="yellow">We'll make a contract with a director soon, too.</font>

23
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:23,008
<font color="yellow">- Who will it be? - It'll be Director Yang Man Ho.</font>

24
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:24,708
<font color="yellow">He's directed many short films.</font>

25
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:27,178
<font color="yellow">He's won many awards at overseas independent film festivals, too.</font>

26
00:01:27,778 --> 00:01:30,748
<font color="yellow">Have you watched any of his works?</font>

27
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:32,148
<font color="yellow">No. What about you?</font>

28
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:34,748
<font color="yellow">I've only heard of his name.</font>

29
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,718
<font color="yellow">Will it be his first full-length film?</font>

30
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,148
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Will it be okay?</font>

31
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:39,478
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

32
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:43,408
<font color="yellow">He's a rare talent. He's amazing.</font>

33
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,718
<font color="yellow">What about investors?</font>

34
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:49,648
<font color="yellow">There's been one investment company that has shown interest.</font>

35
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:51,878
<font color="yellow">Nothing is determined yet.</font>

36
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:55,878
<font color="yellow">Just meet the director first. The script is being written.</font>

37
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:56,978
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

38
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,508
<font color="yellow">Enough of business talk. Let's throw the lines again.</font>

39
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,048
<font color="yellow">We're ready.</font>

40
00:02:02,108 --> 00:02:04,218
<font color="yellow">Are you ready? Remember what we practiced.</font>

41
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:07,508
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

42
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:08,648
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

43
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:16,178
<font color="yellow">We could have met outside.</font>

44
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:17,548
<font color="yellow">He must be working on the script.</font>

45
00:02:18,308 --> 00:02:20,348
<font color="yellow">We haven't watched any of his previous works. Will it be okay?</font>

46
00:02:21,178 --> 00:02:22,308
<font color="yellow">Should we have postponed the meeting?</font>

47
00:02:22,348 --> 00:02:25,178
<font color="yellow">Forget it. We're not here to flatter him.</font>

48
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:27,208
<font color="yellow">We just want to see if we like him.</font>

49
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,178
<font color="yellow">He's a newbie.</font>

50
00:02:29,378 --> 00:02:31,948
<font color="yellow">If we don't like him, I'll tell Mr. Ahn to find a replacement.</font>

51
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,908
<font color="yellow">What? We can't do that.</font>

52
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:37,048
<font color="yellow">We should. We set up this project. Am I wrong?</font>

53
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,978
<font color="yellow">It's here.</font>

54
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:40,008
<font color="yellow">- Is it here? - Yes.</font>

55
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:46,778
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

56
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:51,248
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

57
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:54,648
<font color="yellow">Did Cuckoo in Yangpyeong send you here?</font>

58
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:58,478
<font color="yellow">I told him I'd pay him back when I get the down payment.</font>

59
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,608
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep sending these people here?</font>

60
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:04,108
<font color="yellow">- I'm not scared at all. - Wait.</font>

61
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,878
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Eun Gab from Tiger's Den.</font>

62
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,808
<font color="yellow">- This is Young Bin. - Hello.</font>

63
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:11,208
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

64
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,148
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

65
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:17,208
<font color="yellow">- Let's go in. - Should we go in?</font>

66
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,308
<font color="yellow">Are we going in?</font>

67
00:03:36,848 --> 00:03:39,078
<font color="yellow">- Take a seat. - Go ahead.</font>

68
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,848
<font color="yellow">I have such a terrible hangover.</font>

69
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,548
<font color="yellow">- Should I order something for you? - We're okay.</font>

70
00:03:43,648 --> 00:03:45,108
<font color="yellow">I'm Kim Eun Gab.</font>

71
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,518
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I have no business cards.</font>

72
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:50,878
<font color="yellow">You must be the CEO, and this is Young Bin.</font>

73
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,148
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

74
00:03:53,578 --> 00:03:55,978
<font color="yellow">I'm his manager.</font>

75
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,808
<font color="yellow">Could you leave us alone?</font>

76
00:03:58,048 --> 00:03:59,578
<font color="yellow">I don't like to have too many people in here.</font>

77
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:03,208
<font color="yellow">He's Young Bin's manager. Introduce yourself.</font>

78
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:04,348
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

79
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,478
<font color="yellow">You look so young.</font>

80
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,018
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Ho Jin.</font>

81
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,308
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

82
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:15,908
<font color="yellow">you look just like a bully we had in the army.</font>

83
00:04:16,018 --> 00:04:17,548
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - His name was Lee Ho Sun.</font>

84
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,708
<font color="yellow">I even remember his name. He was such a jerk.</font>

85
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,748
<font color="yellow">Are you related by any chance?</font>

86
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,148
<font color="yellow">- No, we aren't. - I see.</font>

87
00:04:26,078 --> 00:04:27,708
<font color="yellow">You do look like him, though.</font>

88
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,578
<font color="yellow">You look exactly like him. Gosh, that jerk.</font>

89
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,208
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

90
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:41,478
<font color="yellow">Why don't we talk outside?</font>

91
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:45,348
<font color="yellow">I've been here for a few minutes, and the dust is irritating my nose.</font>

92
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,878
<font color="yellow">Those Hollywood idiots.</font>

93
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:51,948
<font color="yellow">They always have to mutilate women. Those perverts.</font>

94
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,308
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

95
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,778
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about the erotic movie "Sticking the Flag In"?</font>

96
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:58,848
<font color="yellow">It's a parody movie.</font>

97
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:02,948
<font color="yellow">In the movie, Koreans slaughter Americans. I'm suddenly reminded.</font>

98
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:07,708
<font color="yellow">What were you saying?</font>

99
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:11,448
<font color="yellow">I suggested we talk about "Lim Hwa Su" outside.</font>

100
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:14,178
<font color="yellow">I don't go out while working on scripts.</font>

101
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:15,978
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

102
00:05:17,408 --> 00:05:18,948
<font color="yellow">I can talk to Young Bin.</font>

103
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,148
<font color="yellow">I don't need you two here.</font>

104
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:22,878
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, come alone next time.</font>

105
00:05:23,648 --> 00:05:26,178
<font color="yellow">You've been so...</font>

106
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:30,408
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Sorry?</font>

107
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:33,478
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

108
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,208
<font color="yellow">I thought you were alone.</font>

109
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,008
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me before you come?</font>

110
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,148
<font color="yellow">- Go in. - What's going on here?</font>

111
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,078
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

112
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,208
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - I think I'm getting a stroke.</font>

113
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:49,948
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What's with him?</font>

114
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:54,448
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

115
00:05:56,378 --> 00:05:58,608
<font color="yellow">I've met many directors so far,</font>

116
00:05:59,178 --> 00:06:01,448
<font color="yellow">but he's just too weird.</font>

117
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,378
<font color="yellow">He's like that all the time.</font>

118
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:06,808
<font color="yellow">You need to be weird to make good movies.</font>

119
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:07,808
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

120
00:06:08,378 --> 00:06:11,708
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I want to let Young Bin work with that newbie.</font>

121
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:13,708
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

122
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,548
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

123
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:19,708
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

124
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,948
<font color="yellow">The contract will be signed after the script is finished.</font>

125
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,748
<font color="yellow">He'll reconsider it if you really don't want him.</font>

126
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:30,648
<font color="yellow">What do you think?</font>

127
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:32,678
<font color="yellow">I have no idea. We didn't have any conversation.</font>

128
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:35,108
<font color="yellow">As soon as we met, he talked about a bully...</font>

129
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:37,778
<font color="yellow">that looked like me. How could he do that?</font>

130
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,108
<font color="yellow">There are many crazy directors.</font>

131
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,608
<font color="yellow">Some of them do make good movies,</font>

132
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,148
<font color="yellow">but some are just downright crazy. He belongs to the latter.</font>

133
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:48,848
<font color="yellow">He's just crazy.</font>

134
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,878
<font color="yellow">I'm scared he'll ruin the movie. What do you think, Young Bin?</font>

135
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:56,078
<font color="yellow">Let's talk after watching his movie.</font>

136
00:06:56,278 --> 00:06:58,478
<font color="yellow">Keep your eyes peeled.</font>

137
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:01,248
<font color="yellow">If the movie is not good, we'll dump him.</font>

138
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:04,148
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin, come to the office every morning from tomorrow.</font>

139
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,208
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

140
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,948
<font color="yellow">Why? I have only one actor to manage.</font>

141
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,248
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of giving you another one.</font>

142
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,078
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - You don't like it?</font>

143
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,748
<font color="yellow">- Who? - Are you getting nervous?</font>

144
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:18,308
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you who it is.</font>

145
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,878
<font color="yellow">This is a nice office.</font>

146
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:25,378
<font color="yellow">I'm sharing it with the other managers anyway.</font>

147
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,648
<font color="yellow">This desk doesn't look good. Let's get a new one.</font>

148
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,678
<font color="yellow">That's unnecessary.</font>

149
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:33,648
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you okay with my working for another actor?</font>

150
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:37,948
<font color="yellow">You decide. Don't worry about me.</font>

151
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:40,148
<font color="yellow">If you're not happy about it, I'll talk to Mr. Kim.</font>

152
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:44,678
<font color="yellow">If you start to care less about me, I won't...</font>

153
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,308
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

154
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:48,708
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

155
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:51,878
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab must trust you.</font>

156
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:55,748
<font color="yellow">- You won his recognition. - They're just short-handed.</font>

157
00:07:56,848 --> 00:07:58,108
<font color="yellow">Are things okay between you and Ji An?</font>

158
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,848
<font color="yellow">It must be awkward because I didn't make a contract with Ms. Kang.</font>

159
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,748
<font color="yellow">She hasn't said anything about it, but I feel a bit bad.</font>

160
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:05,648
<font color="yellow">I don't feel comfortable about meeting Ms. Kang, either.</font>

161
00:08:05,978 --> 00:08:06,978
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

162
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,118
<font color="yellow">You lost favor with your future mother-in-law.</font>

163
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,278
<font color="yellow">Where are Turtle and Joon, by the way?</font>

164
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:16,478
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

165
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,778
<font color="yellow">Look at this hat I found.</font>

166
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,908
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be my favorite hat.</font>

167
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:25,848
<font color="yellow">It's old-fashioned, just like you.</font>

168
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:29,348
<font color="yellow">It looks like it's from the times of "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

169
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,508
<font color="yellow">Don't you think people recognize me?</font>

170
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,808
<font color="yellow">Not even clerks are paying attention to us.</font>

171
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:39,908
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, are you the one in "I'm Just Me"?</font>

172
00:08:40,008 --> 00:08:41,508
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I am. - Oh, my.</font>

173
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,748
<font color="yellow">- I'm Cha Joon. - Really? I was right.</font>

174
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:46,478
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Can I have a picture with you?</font>

175
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:49,048
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - Really? Thank you.</font>

176
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,548
<font color="yellow">My pleasure.</font>

177
00:08:51,178 --> 00:08:52,248
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

178
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,118
<font color="yellow">- I'm just me. - I'm just me.</font>

179
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:56,678
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You're welcome.</font>

180
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,248
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

181
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:02,118
<font color="yellow">- Did you see that? - I did.</font>

182
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,208
<font color="yellow">Can I get a bag?</font>

183
00:09:10,448 --> 00:09:12,478
<font color="yellow">- What are you looking at? - I'm searching social media...</font>

184
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,178
<font color="yellow">for the picture we just took.</font>

185
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:16,848
<font color="yellow">Here it is.</font>

186
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,618
<font color="yellow">Why? What does it say?</font>

187
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:23,948
<font color="yellow">"With Comedian Cha Joon..."</font>

188
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,148
<font color="yellow">You were very funny on that show.</font>

189
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,118
<font color="yellow">Doesn't she know I'm an actor?</font>

190
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:32,578
<font color="yellow">You're introduced as a television personality on portals.</font>

191
00:09:32,678 --> 00:09:33,708
<font color="yellow">Still?</font>

192
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:37,648
<font color="yellow">I asked my company to change it to actor.</font>

193
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:40,578
<font color="yellow">Then again, I'm not an actor.</font>

194
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,208
<font color="yellow">Why are you so depressed? You found a nice hat.</font>

195
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:45,808
<font color="yellow">Forget it. An actor should act.</font>

196
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,048
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim will take care of you now that you signed the contract.</font>

197
00:09:49,248 --> 00:09:50,508
<font color="yellow">He'll probably just find me some auditions.</font>

198
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,118
<font color="yellow">I'm over 30, and I haven't had any significant roles.</font>

199
00:09:54,778 --> 00:09:57,848
<font color="yellow">I'm not even given any names. I'm just Friend 1 or Neighbor 3.</font>

200
00:09:58,548 --> 00:09:59,748
<font color="yellow">I'm just a number.</font>

201
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,778
<font color="yellow">I'd love to have a role that has a name.</font>

202
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:05,618
<font color="yellow">Let's just call Mr. Kim now.</font>

203
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,578
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

204
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:09,948
<font color="yellow">Is it that hard, you coward?</font>

205
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:12,808
<font color="yellow">Coward? Do you think I don't have the courage?</font>

206
00:10:15,308 --> 00:10:18,408
<font color="yellow">Can't he do a better job?</font>

207
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:20,378
<font color="yellow">This is why he got fired.</font>

208
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,178
<font color="yellow">Speak clearly.</font>

209
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,848
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, are you busy?</font>

210
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:29,378
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm too busy to even clean my ears.</font>

211
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:32,378
<font color="yellow">My ears have been itchy. Is someone talking about me?</font>

212
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:33,878
<font color="yellow">- Were you? - No.</font>

213
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,678
<font color="yellow">I wasn't.</font>

214
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:39,348
<font color="yellow">My occupation hasn't changed on the portals.</font>

215
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,448
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

216
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:42,408
<font color="yellow">Give me a second.</font>

217
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:49,348
<font color="yellow">Just a second.</font>

218
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:53,378
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is it?</font>

219
00:10:53,678 --> 00:10:55,178
<font color="yellow">Haven't you revised Joon's profile?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

220
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:56,778
<font color="yellow">Did you tell me to?</font>

221
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:59,078
<font color="yellow">I write down everything you tell me to do.</font>

222
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:01,608
<font color="yellow">- Hang on. - Cha Joon's profile...</font>

223
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:02,948
<font color="yellow">Look carefully.</font>

224
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:07,508
<font color="yellow">You have terrible handwriting. Can't you write any better?</font>

225
00:11:07,678 --> 00:11:09,478
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

226
00:11:10,108 --> 00:11:14,478
<font color="yellow">Joon, I'll call you back. I have an urgent call coming in.</font>

227
00:11:15,878 --> 00:11:16,878
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

228
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:18,548
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

229
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,048
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

230
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:27,478
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow? It's perfect. Okay.</font>

231
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:29,978
<font color="yellow">All right. Bye.</font>

232
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,448
<font color="yellow">Did you hear any good news?</font>

233
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:34,678
<font color="yellow">Order a plant.</font>

234
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,848
<font color="yellow">One of the biggest actors will join us.</font>

235
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:39,878
<font color="yellow">- Who is it? - Oh Chang Seok.</font>

236
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,378
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

237
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:46,248
<font color="yellow">Watch some movies and dramas. Don't just watch music videos.</font>

238
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:49,978
<font color="yellow">By the way, when will I get a regular employment?</font>

239
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,208
<font color="yellow">You don't even know actors' names. You can't become a manager yet.</font>

240
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,508
<font color="yellow">Just revise Joon's profile, okay?</font>

241
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:56,678
<font color="yellow">Okay, Boss.</font>

242
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,078
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

243
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,548
<font color="yellow">You're so annoying.</font>

244
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,808
<font color="yellow">- Am I annoying? - What is wrong with you?</font>

245
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:05,078
<font color="yellow">What happened now?</font>

246
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,178
<font color="yellow">I can't stand his mood swings.</font>

247
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,608
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say.</font>

248
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,848
<font color="yellow">Did you fight again? Just break up. Aren't you getting sick of it?</font>

249
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,078
<font color="yellow">You two are just the same.</font>

250
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:17,108
<font color="yellow">You came in time. Let's watch the movie together.</font>

251
00:12:17,378 --> 00:12:19,608
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the mood. What are you watching?</font>

252
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,878
<font color="yellow">It's by the director who will direct "Lim Hwa Su". We met him today.</font>

253
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,678
<font color="yellow">- What was he like? - He's crazy.</font>

254
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,508
<font color="yellow">Crazy people make good movies.</font>

255
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:30,448
<font color="yellow">They just put on a show to look like artists.</font>

256
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,678
<font color="yellow">Think of Bong Joon Ho or Park Chan Wook.</font>

257
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,048
<font color="yellow">They're normal people, and they make great movies.</font>

258
00:12:34,148 --> 00:12:36,978
<font color="yellow">- I thought he was funny. - Do you think that's funny?</font>

259
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:39,708
<font color="yellow">Did anything happen?</font>

260
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:41,708
<font color="yellow">He said Ho Jin reminded him of a bully he met in the army.</font>

261
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:45,448
<font color="yellow">It's not about that.</font>

262
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,248
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I didn't like him.</font>

263
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,208
<font color="yellow">Let's watch the movie first.</font>

264
00:12:53,408 --> 00:12:54,808
<font color="yellow">(Put your hands up.)</font>

265
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:02,878
<font color="yellow">That was amazing.</font>

266
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:05,378
<font color="yellow">What did you think?</font>

267
00:13:06,508 --> 00:13:09,748
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that jerk knows how to make a great movie.</font>

268
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:12,008
<font color="yellow">He'll be perfect as the director of "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

269
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,578
<font color="yellow">- I know. - Gosh.</font>

270
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,378
<font color="yellow">I was so touched.</font>

271
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:18,348
<font color="yellow">I'd love to work with him.</font>

272
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:21,208
<font color="yellow">Could we all be invited to Cannes?</font>

273
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:24,208
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be hilarious if I tagged along?</font>

274
00:13:24,248 --> 00:13:26,278
<font color="yellow">You pay for your flights.</font>

275
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,678
<font color="yellow">- I'll pay for them. - Forget it.</font>

276
00:13:27,678 --> 00:13:30,578
<font color="yellow">- Don't. - Are you tagging along there, too?</font>

277
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,648
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

278
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,148
<font color="yellow">Do you feel guilty about something?</font>

279
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:48,148
<font color="yellow">Or are you having a fit? Why do you flinch?</font>

280
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:51,608
<font color="yellow">Do you feel guilty about something?</font>

281
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:54,878
<font color="yellow">Because we go to similar restaurants, we keep crossing paths.</font>

282
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:58,348
<font color="yellow">Let's get something straight. I come here more often than you.</font>

283
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,978
<font color="yellow">Exactly eight years ago, I introduced this place to you.</font>

284
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,148
<font color="yellow">Are you forgetting things? Is it dementia? Go see a doctor.</font>

285
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,208
<font color="yellow">Why did you get an office near mine?</font>

286
00:14:07,708 --> 00:14:10,478
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Forget it. I don't want to talk to you.</font>

287
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:13,978
<font color="yellow">You just ran out of things to say. You're ridiculous.</font>

288
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:15,878
<font color="yellow">I introduced this place to you.</font>

289
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:17,778
<font color="yellow">And you tried to take Young Bin from me, too. You must be feeling guilty.</font>

290
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:18,948
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

291
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,448
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

292
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,278
<font color="yellow">She's going senile.</font>

293
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,948
<font color="yellow">I wanted to eat here.</font>

294
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:38,678
<font color="yellow">You're late.</font>

295
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:41,448
<font color="yellow">I'm on time. You were early.</font>

296
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:45,548
<font color="yellow">Hey, you look great. Are you getting injections?</font>

297
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:48,048
<font color="yellow">I was just born this way.</font>

298
00:14:48,748 --> 00:14:50,378
<font color="yellow">Anyway, you made the right decision.</font>

299
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:53,908
<font color="yellow">A small and competent company like this is the best.</font>

300
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:55,108
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

301
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:58,378
<font color="yellow">I haven't said that I decided to work with you.</font>

302
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:01,278
<font color="yellow">You said so on the phone yesterday.</font>

303
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:03,008
<font color="yellow">I even prepared a contract.</font>

304
00:15:03,108 --> 00:15:06,448
<font color="yellow">I said it'd be nice. I didn't say I'd do it.</font>

305
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:08,008
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about it.</font>

306
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,878
<font color="yellow">You think for so long.</font>

307
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:13,248
<font color="yellow">You don't think a lot when you meet women.</font>

308
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:15,778
<font color="yellow">You don't need to think when you meet them.</font>

309
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:18,478
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm talking about.</font>

310
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:21,078
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Boss. - Knock before you come in.</font>

311
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:25,148
<font color="yellow">- Sorry. Hello. - Hello.</font>

312
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:26,978
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

313
00:15:30,148 --> 00:15:31,178
<font color="yellow">Who is she?</font>

314
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:34,248
<font color="yellow">She's my employee, of course. What else would she be?</font>

315
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,878
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

316
00:15:37,508 --> 00:15:39,248
<font color="yellow">You're very handsome.</font>

317
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:40,678
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

318
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,408
<font color="yellow">You're very funny. You have good eyes for people, too.</font>

319
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,208
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab.</font>

320
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:50,148
<font color="yellow">I'll sign the contract right away if she can be my manager.</font>

321
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,408
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

322
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:53,978
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - Yes.</font>

323
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:55,678
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

324
00:15:56,448 --> 00:15:57,648
<font color="yellow">What's up, man?</font>

325
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:00,178
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

326
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,908
<font color="yellow">How old are you?</font>

327
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:04,778
<font color="yellow">- I'm... - Go back to work.</font>

328
00:16:05,748 --> 00:16:06,748
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

329
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,508
<font color="yellow">Keep this.</font>

330
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,408
<font color="yellow">- Has he left? - Yes, he has.</font>

331
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,348
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he keeps changing his mind.</font>

332
00:16:23,648 --> 00:16:25,408
<font color="yellow">He's so sly.</font>

333
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:28,248
<font color="yellow">Really? He seemed nice.</font>

334
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:33,848
<font color="yellow">If he signs the contract, can I be his manager?</font>

335
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:37,178
<font color="yellow">You've been talking about becoming a manager a lot.</font>

336
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:39,848
<font color="yellow">You don't seem to trust me.</font>

337
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:42,548
<font color="yellow">I can do it. Trust me.</font>

338
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,648
<font color="yellow">Wait a little more.</font>

339
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:47,578
<font color="yellow">You should also be able to write Korean.</font>

340
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,078
<font color="yellow">Practice, okay?</font>

341
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:51,408
<font color="yellow">I'm darn good at Korean now.</font>

342
00:16:51,548 --> 00:16:53,878
<font color="yellow">This is what I'm talking about. Watch your language.</font>

343
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,878
<font color="yellow">All I hear are swear words.</font>

344
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:58,508
<font color="yellow">I learn it from you.</font>

345
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,008
<font color="yellow">- That little... - Cut it out.</font>

346
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,578
<font color="yellow">I decide what I say.</font>

347
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:11,048
<font color="yellow">You're good. Is playing games the only thing you do?</font>

348
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:13,248
<font color="yellow">I almost failed to get into university because of it.</font>

349
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:17,148
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

350
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:20,278
<font color="yellow">I hate to have people in my studio,</font>

351
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:21,508
<font color="yellow">but I like you.</font>

352
00:17:22,348 --> 00:17:23,648
<font color="yellow">Who's that old man?</font>

353
00:17:23,978 --> 00:17:25,818
<font color="yellow">He's my cousin. He's an actor, too.</font>

354
00:17:26,408 --> 00:17:28,148
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm actor Cha Joon.</font>

355
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:31,448
<font color="yellow">I was so touched by your movie.</font>

356
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,578
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

357
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:37,508
<font color="yellow">And... The bully is here again. You annoy me.</font>

358
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:38,578
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

359
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,408
<font color="yellow">Is the script ready?</font>

360
00:17:40,578 --> 00:17:42,478
<font color="yellow">I'm working hard on it. It'll be ready soon.</font>

361
00:17:44,008 --> 00:17:46,318
<font color="yellow">Exactly when will it be ready?</font>

362
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:49,148
<font color="yellow">Are you bullying me?</font>

363
00:17:49,578 --> 00:17:51,878
<font color="yellow">It'll be ready in time. What are you worried about?</font>

364
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:55,348
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but can you stop calling me a bully?</font>

365
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,818
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee majored in film. He has an eye for movies.</font>

366
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,348
<font color="yellow">Goal!</font>

367
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:02,678
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I quit.</font>

368
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,318
<font color="yellow">You want to be on the movie?</font>

369
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:10,378
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if you could give him an audition.</font>

370
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,148
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'd love...</font>

371
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:15,578
<font color="yellow">to appear as one of Lim Hwa Su's subordinates.</font>

372
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,678
<font color="yellow">- Which one? - General Lee Choon Bong.</font>

373
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,848
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

374
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,708
<font color="yellow">- Do you remember the lines? - Right now?</font>

375
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:29,578
<font color="yellow">There's no special time for acting.</font>

376
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:32,908
<font color="yellow">You need to be able to do it right away. Forget it if you can't.</font>

377
00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:35,178
<font color="yellow">I can do it. I'll try.</font>

378
00:18:35,478 --> 00:18:37,178
<font color="yellow">I'll do it right now.</font>

379
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,948
<font color="yellow">"You jerks. Do you know who I am?"</font>

380
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,908
<font color="yellow">"I'm Lim Hwa Su's right-hand man, Lee Choon Bong. I'm so dumbfounded."</font>

381
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,748
<font color="yellow">"My name means a phoenix."</font>

382
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:00,078
<font color="yellow">"Choon Bong."</font>

383
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,878
<font color="yellow">"A cuckoo lays eggs in front of a phoenix?"</font>

384
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:05,378
<font color="yellow">"I'll cut your head off."</font>

385
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,078
<font color="yellow">That was nice.</font>

386
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,648
<font color="yellow">"I'll cut your head off." It was so dramatic. Good job.</font>

387
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:12,678
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Let's play another round.</font>

388
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:16,908
<font color="yellow">Go, Director Yang.</font>

389
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,878
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Isn't this office so nice?</font>

390
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:24,178
<font color="yellow">Don't watch any pornography in here.</font>

391
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:25,578
<font color="yellow">It's a nice office, indeed.</font>

392
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,708
<font color="yellow">You don't look so happy.</font>

393
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:32,678
<font color="yellow">We met Director Yang today. It was annoying.</font>

394
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,008
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

395
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:37,778
<font color="yellow">I don't know why, but he keeps picking on me.</font>

396
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,148
<font color="yellow">He is weird.</font>

397
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,248
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to Mr. Ahn...</font>

398
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,548
<font color="yellow">and see what we can do.</font>

399
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:47,548
<font color="yellow">Young Bin likes him, though.</font>

400
00:19:48,248 --> 00:19:49,678
<font color="yellow">We watched his movie,</font>

401
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:52,778
<font color="yellow">and it was nice.</font>

402
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,478
<font color="yellow">They were?</font>

403
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,278
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

404
00:19:56,878 --> 00:19:58,108
<font color="yellow">Then there's no problem.</font>

405
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:01,408
<font color="yellow">As long as he can do his job,</font>

406
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,048
<font color="yellow">what can we do even if he's a jerk?</font>

407
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:06,378
<font color="yellow">("The Restructuring of Memory")</font>

408
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:08,048
<font color="yellow">Have you read this?</font>

409
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,208
<font color="yellow">Yes, I liked it.</font>

410
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:12,078
<font color="yellow">There have been many fantasy movies,</font>

411
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:14,208
<font color="yellow">but it has interesting characters.</font>

412
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:18,278
<font color="yellow">Right? I went to so much trouble to get this one.</font>

413
00:20:18,648 --> 00:20:21,548
<font color="yellow">Lee El doesn't like it. She doesn't have an eye for movies.</font>

414
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:24,278
<font color="yellow">- She only listens to her mother. - I'll talk to her.</font>

415
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,548
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

416
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,978
<font color="yellow">You've only worked for Young Bin.</font>

417
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:30,248
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

418
00:20:30,248 --> 00:20:31,948
<font color="yellow">It'll be different with her.</font>

419
00:20:32,778 --> 00:20:36,678
<font color="yellow">She's not your friend. You need to win her trust.</font>

420
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:38,878
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

421
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:42,348
<font color="yellow">Are you scared or something? Be confident.</font>

422
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,178
<font color="yellow">Make her trust you.</font>

423
00:20:44,908 --> 00:20:46,708
<font color="yellow">You're meeting her for the first time today, right?</font>

424
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,318
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm heading out soon.</font>

425
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:51,818
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to come with you?</font>

426
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:53,578
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

427
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:58,508
<font color="yellow">Good luck. Don't get nervous in front of a beautiful actress.</font>

428
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,948
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Okay.</font>

429
00:21:10,748 --> 00:21:12,208
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm Lee Ho Jin.</font>

430
00:21:12,848 --> 00:21:14,848
<font color="yellow">Hello. Just a second.</font>

431
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,178
<font color="yellow">I've heard a lot about you from Mr. Kim.</font>

432
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,008
<font color="yellow">You look young.</font>

433
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,708
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

434
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:29,208
<font color="yellow">You're working for only Young Bin, right?</font>

435
00:21:30,778 --> 00:21:32,008
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

436
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,448
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

437
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,478
<font color="yellow">It's about the next movie.</font>

438
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,948
<font color="yellow">I heard you didn't like the script.</font>

439
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:02,478
<font color="yellow">I didn't. The story is too complicated.</font>

440
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,978
<font color="yellow">Going back and forth in time. Will people like it?</font>

441
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:10,478
<font color="yellow">You have a point. They might be tired of fantasy movies.</font>

442
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,508
<font color="yellow">But the script was quite nice.</font>

443
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,748
<font color="yellow">I think it'll be a hit if you ask me.</font>

444
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:21,048
<font color="yellow">But it's a supporting role. I don't want any more of those.</font>

445
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,478
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

446
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,048
<font color="yellow">You could see it that way, too.</font>

447
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:30,378
<font color="yellow">But the character itself is even stronger than the main one.</font>

448
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:33,348
<font color="yellow">That's what burdens me.</font>

449
00:22:34,248 --> 00:22:35,408
<font color="yellow">It's too strong.</font>

450
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:39,508
<font color="yellow">Right, but you had a few strong roles when you had just debuted.</font>

451
00:22:39,648 --> 00:22:41,348
<font color="yellow">I love your acting.</font>

452
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,548
<font color="yellow">Those roles were...</font>

453
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:46,278
<font color="yellow">so nice that I can never forget.</font>

454
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:48,108
<font color="yellow">- Is that so? - Yes.</font>

455
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:52,878
<font color="yellow">Still, I want to do something else.</font>

456
00:22:57,178 --> 00:23:00,678
<font color="yellow">I heard you usually choose works by yourself.</font>

457
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,808
<font color="yellow">Yes. I need to like the movie. Otherwise, I don't do it.</font>

458
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:10,648
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

459
00:23:11,078 --> 00:23:14,548
<font color="yellow">Now, you're working with us.</font>

460
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,678
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have a little trust in us?</font>

461
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:21,778
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim and I think it'd be great if you could do this movie.</font>

462
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,748
<font color="yellow">You're very unusual.</font>

463
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:32,208
<font color="yellow">You seem very nervous, but you say all you want to say.</font>

464
00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,248
<font color="yellow">- I do? - Yes.</font>

465
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:35,748
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

466
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:39,308
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

467
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,478
<font color="yellow">I'll read the script again.</font>

468
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,578
<font color="yellow">Really? Thank you.</font>

469
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,048
<font color="yellow">Are you getting a desk for Ho Jin's office?</font>

470
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:56,048
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's his first office.</font>

471
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:57,778
<font color="yellow">A desk would be meaningful.</font>

472
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:01,408
<font color="yellow">You care so much about your manager unlike someone.</font>

473
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:04,408
<font color="yellow">Are you still thinking about it?</font>

474
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,448
<font color="yellow">He said I did a good job, but he hasn't given me the role.</font>

475
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:09,848
<font color="yellow">Meet up with him and talk some more.</font>

476
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,108
<font color="yellow">Meet him often and win his heart.</font>

477
00:24:12,378 --> 00:24:13,808
<font color="yellow">I'm too shy.</font>

478
00:24:14,448 --> 00:24:16,678
<font color="yellow">Why do I feel so uncomfortable around older men?</font>

479
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:19,308
<font color="yellow">You still feel uncomfortable around Eun Gab, too.</font>

480
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:21,948
<font color="yellow">They must feel uncomfortable because you look even older than them.</font>

481
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,778
<font color="yellow">You look older than Young Bin and Ho Jin, too.</font>

482
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,978
<font color="yellow">- Is it because of porn? - That's correct.</font>

483
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:29,108
<font color="yellow">- I'll tell Ho Jin to come here. - Do that.</font>

484
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,648
<font color="yellow">Where are you? Do you want to come here?</font>

485
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,578
<font color="yellow">I can't. I'm having a meeting.</font>

486
00:24:37,508 --> 00:24:39,748
<font color="yellow">I see. When will you be done?</font>

487
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,608
<font color="yellow">I think I'll stay for dinner. Did something happen?</font>

488
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,578
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. All right.</font>

489
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:51,078
<font color="yellow">He's been ignoring us since he started working for the actress.</font>

490
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:54,048
<font color="yellow">You're not his top priority anymore.</font>

491
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:56,408
<font color="yellow">Cut it out. I'll have to choose.</font>

492
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:59,678
<font color="yellow">Should I give the director some furniture as a present?</font>

493
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,878
<font color="yellow">Just buy him some drinks and take him to clubs.</font>

494
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:03,308
<font color="yellow">That sounds great.</font>

495
00:25:19,348 --> 00:25:20,348
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

496
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:24,778
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

497
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:34,108
<font color="yellow">Why is he sleeping here half-naked?</font>

498
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,248
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

499
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,248
<font color="yellow">Don't wake him up.</font>

500
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:39,948
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring him here?</font>

501
00:25:40,148 --> 00:25:42,308
<font color="yellow">It's his fault. He made him drink.</font>

502
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:44,478
<font color="yellow">He was a handful when he was drunk.</font>

503
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:47,578
<font color="yellow">- Do you know what he said? - What did he say this time?</font>

504
00:25:47,678 --> 00:25:49,248
<font color="yellow">I don't remember well,</font>

505
00:25:49,408 --> 00:25:51,348
<font color="yellow">but he apparently implied that he'd cast Joon.</font>

506
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:54,378
<font color="yellow">Although he was very drunk, he clearly said,</font>

507
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,108
<font color="yellow">"You're great."</font>

508
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:59,478
<font color="yellow">"The role is yours."</font>

509
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:01,578
<font color="yellow">Will he remember it?</font>

510
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,448
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

511
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,648
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. Send him home now.</font>

512
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:11,208
<font color="yellow">- You really don't like him. - He looks down on me.</font>

513
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:12,508
<font color="yellow">You deserve to be looked down on.</font>

514
00:26:12,578 --> 00:26:14,048
<font color="yellow">That's life.</font>

515
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:16,508
<font color="yellow">You need to be patient and flatter others.</font>

516
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:19,348
<font color="yellow">Are you using your cousin to get a role?</font>

517
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:23,448
<font color="yellow">If I try to put up with him, we'll end up in a fight.</font>

518
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:32,898
<font color="yellow">You're up. I made some soup.</font>

519
00:26:33,228 --> 00:26:35,428
<font color="yellow">I don't eat anything after drinking.</font>

520
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,298
<font color="yellow">You'll hurt your stomach. I'll get you a glass.</font>

521
00:26:39,958 --> 00:26:41,098
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

522
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:48,728
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, are you busy today?</font>

523
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:50,958
<font color="yellow">- No, I'm not. - That's great.</font>

524
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:52,758
<font color="yellow">Can you go somewhere with me?</font>

525
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:56,828
<font color="yellow">I'm visiting there for the script. It'll help you as well.</font>

526
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:58,328
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Okay.</font>

527
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,428
<font color="yellow">You're not coming, are you?</font>

528
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:03,458
<font color="yellow">- No. - All right.</font>

529
00:27:03,828 --> 00:27:06,598
<font color="yellow">Can I come with you?</font>

530
00:27:06,728 --> 00:27:07,728
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

531
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,658
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, can I borrow some clothes?</font>

532
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:11,758
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

533
00:27:12,528 --> 00:27:13,728
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

534
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:20,458
<font color="yellow">He's like a butler.</font>

535
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,158
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Are you really not coming?</font>

536
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,058
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting Lee El.</font>

537
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:27,658
<font color="yellow">Again? Are you favoring her because she's a woman?</font>

538
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,128
<font color="yellow">It seems like you're enjoying it.</font>

539
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:32,128
<font color="yellow">It's just work.</font>

540
00:27:32,758 --> 00:27:34,628
<font color="yellow">You're neglecting me these days.</font>

541
00:27:34,898 --> 00:27:37,898
<font color="yellow">Have fun with the director.</font>

542
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,728
<font color="yellow">Are you a couple?</font>

543
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:41,128
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

544
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,398
<font color="yellow">I hope I don't end up tagging along.</font>

545
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,828
<font color="yellow">Joon, why is he wearing that hat?</font>

546
00:28:05,528 --> 00:28:07,858
<font color="yellow">I told him I bought it for the movie, and he took it.</font>

547
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:10,158
<font color="yellow">What is this place?</font>

548
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,398
<font color="yellow">Let me introduce you to the guys.</font>

549
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:19,358
<font color="yellow">You've seen him on television, right? This is Young Bin.</font>

550
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:23,498
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

551
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,258
<font color="yellow">They're his friends.</font>

552
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:27,028
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

553
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:33,758
<font color="yellow">- Sit down. - Okay.</font>

554
00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:39,698
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

555
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:41,498
<font color="yellow">Where are we?</font>

556
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:43,328
<font color="yellow">He's a former member of a gang.</font>

557
00:28:44,028 --> 00:28:47,198
<font color="yellow">He's retired now. He runs a business here.</font>

558
00:28:49,098 --> 00:28:50,158
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

559
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:54,698
<font color="yellow">I come here often to cover stories. You should, too.</font>

560
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,758
<font color="yellow">It'll come in handy when you do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

561
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:58,628
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,128
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

563
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,328
<font color="yellow">What exactly is the business they're running?</font>

564
00:29:09,658 --> 00:29:12,728
<font color="yellow">The deadline is coming up. Are you ready for it?</font>

565
00:29:14,258 --> 00:29:16,958
<font color="yellow">- You're telling me that now? - They must be lenders by name...</font>

566
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:19,428
<font color="yellow">when in fact, they're something else.</font>

567
00:29:19,498 --> 00:29:21,598
<font color="yellow">I know what you mean. Be quiet.</font>

568
00:29:22,058 --> 00:29:23,198
<font color="yellow">I want to leave.</font>

569
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,558
<font color="yellow">The director wants us to observe the people here.</font>

570
00:29:26,028 --> 00:29:27,458
<font color="yellow">He said it'll improve our acting.</font>

571
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:30,298
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with me? It won't be of any help to me.</font>

572
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:32,358
<font color="yellow">How will this help me?</font>

573
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:34,998
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up, I'll have to pay you a visit!</font>

574
00:29:38,858 --> 00:29:41,128
<font color="yellow">Can you keep it down?</font>

575
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:42,758
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

576
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:49,498
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

577
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:52,828
<font color="yellow">They must really be gangsters.</font>

578
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:54,828
<font color="yellow">I said be quiet.</font>

579
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:55,928
<font color="yellow">Where's Young Bin?</font>

580
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,828
<font color="yellow">He went outside to talk to the director.</font>

581
00:29:58,128 --> 00:29:59,328
<font color="yellow">We should go outside, too.</font>

582
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:01,628
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

583
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:07,898
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill that scumbag.</font>

584
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:20,298
<font color="yellow">Cheers. Drink up.</font>

585
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:29,728
<font color="yellow">We emailed you the new script.</font>

586
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:31,498
<font color="yellow">Let us know what you think.</font>

587
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:33,058
<font color="yellow">Already?</font>

588
00:30:33,158 --> 00:30:34,228
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

589
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:37,658
<font color="yellow">We just added a new female character to the original script.</font>

590
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,158
<font color="yellow">A female character?</font>

591
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,858
<font color="yellow">You'll see.</font>

592
00:30:42,328 --> 00:30:43,328
<font color="yellow">Young Bin.</font>

593
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:47,198
<font color="yellow">I'd like you to put on 10kg.</font>

594
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:49,628
<font color="yellow">That'll make you look more like a gangster.</font>

595
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:51,728
<font color="yellow">- I'll do that. - Okay.</font>

596
00:30:52,198 --> 00:30:55,898
<font color="yellow">Forget being handsome and dashing.</font>

597
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:58,458
<font color="yellow">We need you to focus on acting.</font>

598
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:00,998
<font color="yellow">We want something lifelike and realistic.</font>

599
00:31:01,328 --> 00:31:03,258
<font color="yellow">Okay. That's the kind of movie I like.</font>

600
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:07,158
<font color="yellow">I like Kathryn Bigelow's movies and "Sicario".
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

601
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,298
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

602
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:10,858
<font color="yellow">You read my mind.</font>

603
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:12,958
<font color="yellow">I'm going to make a perfect reproduction of the era.</font>

604
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:15,558
<font color="yellow">You know the theater scene at the climax, right?</font>

605
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:17,128
<font color="yellow">I really want to do a good job on that one.</font>

606
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:19,828
<font color="yellow">- The scene where the fire starts? - Yes.</font>

607
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:23,064
<font color="yellow">I don't want to shoot it on a set. I'll go down to the countryside...</font>

608
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:25,134
<font color="yellow">and either buy or rent a theater.</font>

609
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:26,728
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to set the whole thing on fire.</font>

610
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:29,128
<font color="yellow">I'd like that, too,</font>

611
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:32,728
<font color="yellow">- but what about the budget? - I'll ask the production company.</font>

612
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,858
<font color="yellow">That's what the director and the actor think is best for the movie.</font>

613
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:38,398
<font color="yellow">What are they going to do about it?</font>

614
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,698
<font color="yellow">- Right. - Yes.</font>

615
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,898
<font color="yellow">That being said, I'll call them right now.</font>

616
00:31:46,898 --> 00:31:47,898
<font color="yellow">Now?</font>

617
00:31:52,528 --> 00:31:54,498
<font color="yellow">That man is a lunatic!</font>

618
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:56,898
<font color="yellow">I told you so.</font>

619
00:31:57,228 --> 00:31:59,258
<font color="yellow">Does he think this is my lunch money he's taking?</font>

620
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:01,458
<font color="yellow">Does he expect me to hand him over millions of dollars just like that?</font>

621
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,128
<font color="yellow">We never said we're shooting a block-buster.</font>

622
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:06,898
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do, then?</font>

623
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,228
<font color="yellow">He wants to build a complete set in the countryside.</font>

624
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:15,098
<font color="yellow">He won't use computer graphics. He wants the real thing.</font>

625
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:16,898
<font color="yellow">I mean, this isn't Hollywood.</font>

626
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:19,728
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you? I told you he'd be like that.</font>

627
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:21,398
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

628
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,898
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joy. Tell Manager Lee that I want to see him.</font>

629
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:25,758
<font color="yellow">He didn't come in yet.</font>

630
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:28,698
<font color="yellow">Give him a call and tell him I need to discuss something.</font>

631
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:34,798
<font color="yellow">Why the sour face? Are you upset with me?</font>

632
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:36,898
<font color="yellow">I'm not your secretary.</font>

633
00:32:37,158 --> 00:32:41,028
<font color="yellow">All I do is make phone calls. When am I going to be a manager?</font>

634
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,628
<font color="yellow">Then don't do it. Gosh, you're so whiny.</font>

635
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,428
<font color="yellow">What? Are you talking to me?</font>

636
00:32:45,428 --> 00:32:47,428
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

637
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,798
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? Should we get a new director?</font>

638
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:58,158
<font color="yellow">Isn't your skin dry? Come closer.</font>

639
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:07,898
<font color="yellow">It's nice that you work at an office now.</font>

640
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:10,128
<font color="yellow">You even have time to drink tea with me.</font>

641
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,598
<font color="yellow">- Have you met Lee El? - Yes.</font>

642
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,028
<font color="yellow">It's weird having to work with someone other than Young Bin.</font>

643
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:18,728
<font color="yellow">I bet it is.</font>

644
00:33:19,028 --> 00:33:20,798
<font color="yellow">It must feel like you're getting real work done.</font>

645
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:22,358
<font color="yellow">I guess you could say that.</font>

646
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,328
<font color="yellow">Is she pretty?</font>

647
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:27,958
<font color="yellow">She's all right.</font>

648
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,398
<font color="yellow">What? Does it bother you?</font>

649
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:36,228
<font color="yellow">Of course, it does. You're tagging along with a pretty woman.</font>

650
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:40,468
<font color="yellow">I found a new side in you, Suh Ji An.</font>

651
00:33:43,058 --> 00:33:44,798
<font color="yellow">What about Young Bin? Is he sad to let you go?</font>

652
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,758
<font color="yellow">He's best friends now with the director of "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

653
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:51,128
<font color="yellow">People might think they've been friends forever.</font>

654
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:53,528
<font color="yellow">You're the one who's bothered the most.</font>

655
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:54,858
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

656
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,258
<font color="yellow">- Are you sad to see them like that? - Of course not. Why would I be?</font>

657
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,098
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

658
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:01,698
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

659
00:34:05,428 --> 00:34:09,428
<font color="yellow">We have to go with Director Yang. Why would they get a new director?</font>

660
00:34:09,528 --> 00:34:10,798
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd say that.</font>

661
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:15,798
<font color="yellow">But Mr. Kim doesn't like him and Mr. Ahn is furious.</font>

662
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:19,158
<font color="yellow">He's asking for a bigger budget and was very rude to them.</font>

663
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,198
<font color="yellow">What else did he say?</font>

664
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:23,358
<font color="yellow">He called Mr. Ahn a miser who knows nothing about movies.</font>

665
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:26,028
<font color="yellow">That's just the way he talks.</font>

666
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,098
<font color="yellow">He's doing all that for the movie.</font>

667
00:34:29,198 --> 00:34:30,468
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

668
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,428
<font color="yellow">You can't take his side for something like that?</font>

669
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,298
<font color="yellow">I'm not taking his side.</font>

670
00:34:36,598 --> 00:34:39,298
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I just wish we find investors for the movie.</font>

671
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,828
<font color="yellow">- Are you still with him? - Yes.</font>

672
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:47,828
<font color="yellow">I really shouldn't have had that last drink.</font>

673
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:52,228
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm really liking this hat.</font>

674
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,858
<font color="yellow">You can have it.</font>

675
00:34:55,498 --> 00:34:58,328
<font color="yellow">Should I wear this and run around in my panties.</font>

676
00:34:58,558 --> 00:35:01,028
<font color="yellow">In my panties, in my panties</font>

677
00:35:02,158 --> 00:35:03,198
<font color="yellow">Would you like that?</font>

678
00:35:06,028 --> 00:35:07,098
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

679
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:09,468
<font color="yellow">That role of Lee Choon Bong...</font>

680
00:35:10,598 --> 00:35:13,828
<font color="yellow">I'm doing it, right? That's what you said.</font>

681
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:16,128
<font color="yellow">I said that?</font>

682
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:18,358
<font color="yellow">That's what you said. I heard you say it.</font>

683
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:21,828
<font color="yellow">I don't remember saying that.</font>

684
00:35:23,198 --> 00:35:26,698
<font color="yellow">You think you can pull off a gangster role?</font>

685
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:30,598
<font color="yellow">You don't have the face for it.</font>

686
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,128
<font color="yellow">Not to mention your body.</font>

687
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:36,098
<font color="yellow">There are skinny and fast gangsters out there.</font>

688
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,558
<font color="yellow">You know, like Sirasoni.</font>

689
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:42,428
<font color="yellow">Lee Choon Bong has to be big.</font>

690
00:35:42,428 --> 00:35:43,998
<font color="yellow">He's a real tough guy with a muscular body.</font>

691
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,198
<font color="yellow">I'll work out, then.</font>

692
00:35:45,828 --> 00:35:46,858
<font color="yellow">I'll work out.</font>

693
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:50,468
<font color="yellow">I'm confident that I'll look like Ma Dong Seok by the day of shooting.</font>

694
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,128
<font color="yellow">Having the body is one thing,</font>

695
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,698
<font color="yellow">but you also need to have the look and the aura.</font>

696
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:58,098
<font color="yellow">You're lacking them.</font>

697
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,498
<font color="yellow">I'm not feeling it.</font>

698
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,628
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the bathroom. I can't hold it in anymore.</font>

699
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:11,858
<font color="yellow">He doesn't remember.</font>

700
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:14,758
<font color="yellow">What if he doesn't remember about today?</font>

701
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:16,898
<font color="yellow">At least he hasn't rejected me yet.</font>

702
00:36:18,158 --> 00:36:19,228
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

703
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:22,628
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do method acting. I'll be a real gangster.</font>

704
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:25,604
<font color="yellow">A real gangster.</font>

705
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,146
<font color="yellow">You're wasting your time again.</font>

706
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:39,346
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

707
00:36:39,776 --> 00:36:42,176
<font color="yellow">Actors who played homeless roles...</font>

708
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:44,246
<font color="yellow">lived with actual homeless people for months.</font>

709
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:48,276
<font color="yellow">I know that, but what does getting a tattoo have to do with acting?</font>

710
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:49,416
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

711
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:53,146
<font color="yellow">Did you not see their tattoos? Tattoos are symbolic.</font>

712
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:56,306
<font color="yellow">I'll be able to immerse myself in the character with this.</font>

713
00:36:56,306 --> 00:36:59,346
<font color="yellow">Actors like Tom Hardy do look cool with tattoos. But you?</font>

714
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,476
<font color="yellow">I'll look like a real man.</font>

715
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,706
<font color="yellow">A real man.</font>

716
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,046
<font color="yellow">You'd look like a South American drug dealer.</font>

717
00:37:07,046 --> 00:37:08,106
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

718
00:37:10,546 --> 00:37:13,306
<font color="yellow">This feels like the time I got circumcised. I'm so nervous.</font>

719
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,546
<font color="yellow">What kind of tattoo are you going to get?</font>

720
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:18,446
<font color="yellow">Dragon? Tiger? Carp?</font>

721
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,416
<font color="yellow">Aren't they too much?</font>

722
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:28,416
<font color="yellow">You need a tiger on your body to look like a real gangster.</font>

723
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:31,376
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't a big tattoo like that hurt a lot?</font>

724
00:37:31,476 --> 00:37:33,806
<font color="yellow">I have a good idea. You should get it on your face.</font>

725
00:37:34,146 --> 00:37:36,946
<font color="yellow">You should get a tattoo of a tiger's whiskers and a nose.</font>

726
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:39,416
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to beat you up?</font>

727
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:41,346
<font color="yellow">Mr. Cha Joon?</font>

728
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,146
<font color="yellow">(Lee Choon Bong)</font>

729
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:55,146
<font color="yellow">Yes, Toni Kroos.</font>

730
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,546
<font color="yellow">Can you take a shower?</font>

731
00:37:58,346 --> 00:37:59,806
<font color="yellow">I can't get water on my tattoo just yet.</font>

732
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:03,046
<font color="yellow">Don't I look tough?</font>

733
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:06,706
<font color="yellow">No, you look old and nasty.</font>

734
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,746
<font color="yellow">You don't know what it feels like to be a strong man.</font>

735
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:16,546
<font color="yellow">Why "Lee Choon Bong"? Aren't you worried about after the movie?</font>

736
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:17,546
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

737
00:38:17,806 --> 00:38:20,546
<font color="yellow">It's the name of my first role ever.</font>

738
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:24,276
<font color="yellow">I've always been something like Friend 2, Neighbor 3.</font>

739
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,916
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm Lee Choon Bong.</font>

740
00:38:27,006 --> 00:38:28,346
<font color="yellow">What if you don't get the part?</font>

741
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,646
<font color="yellow">That'll be worse than a tattoo of an ex-girlfriend's name.</font>

742
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,346
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

743
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:34,776
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me with Vaseline on your hand.</font>

744
00:38:35,106 --> 00:38:37,746
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth. Jerk.</font>

745
00:38:40,376 --> 00:38:42,046
<font color="yellow">Did you go over the new script?</font>

746
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:43,416
<font color="yellow">I was going to after you go over it.</font>

747
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:45,976
<font color="yellow">Why did that lunatic edit it like this?</font>

748
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:48,106
<font color="yellow">Can you ask him? I think I'm going crazy.</font>

749
00:38:48,106 --> 00:38:50,416
<font color="yellow">What is it this time? Stop picking on him.</font>

750
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,846
<font color="yellow">You're not the leading role anymore. It's some female character.</font>

751
00:38:59,106 --> 00:39:00,176
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

752
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:06,376
<font color="yellow">I knew this would happen. That psycho has done it again.</font>

753
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,376
<font color="yellow">A female leading role?</font>

754
00:39:08,776 --> 00:39:11,546
<font color="yellow">You and Young Bin have to go see Director Yang. Got it?</font>

755
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:14,146
<font color="yellow">Get him to revert the changes he's made.</font>

756
00:39:15,446 --> 00:39:17,746
<font color="yellow">Do as I say. Hold on.</font>

757
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:22,176
<font color="yellow">I'm getting a call. I'll call you back.</font>

758
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:26,806
<font color="yellow">Chang Seok. I called you yesterday. Thanks for calling me back.</font>

759
00:39:27,376 --> 00:39:29,416
<font color="yellow">I have good news for you.</font>

760
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:30,946
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sign the contract.</font>

761
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:35,076
<font color="yellow">You made a good decision.</font>

762
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:38,206
<font color="yellow">Send me the contract and I'll sign it.</font>

763
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,416
<font color="yellow">Can you get Joy Jung to deliver me the contract?</font>

764
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:44,776
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

765
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:48,546
<font color="yellow">She'll be my manager anyway. I'd like to befriend her in advance.</font>

766
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:52,576
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

767
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:54,446
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bye.</font>

768
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:13,976
<font color="yellow">We'll sign Oh Chang Seok today. Actually, you will.</font>

769
00:40:15,576 --> 00:40:17,206
<font color="yellow">Me? Why?</font>

770
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:21,546
<font color="yellow">Can you stop being like that?</font>

771
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,706
<font color="yellow">I'm making you a manager.</font>

772
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:25,206
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious? - Of course.</font>

773
00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:27,046
<font color="yellow">- Seriously? - Yes.</font>

774
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:30,946
<font color="yellow">But you have to be careful. He's a real lady's man.</font>

775
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,576
<font color="yellow">He hits on every woman he sees.</font>

776
00:40:33,546 --> 00:40:35,276
<font color="yellow">He hits women?</font>

777
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:37,376
<font color="yellow">He... He hits on them.</font>

778
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:40,306
<font color="yellow">- He hits them? - No.</font>

779
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:41,946
<font color="yellow">He hits on them. He likes to hit on women.</font>

780
00:40:41,946 --> 00:40:42,976
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

781
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,176
<font color="yellow">It means...</font>

782
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:47,876
<font color="yellow">How do I explain this?</font>

783
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:50,676
<font color="yellow">What does "hitting on someone" mean? "To hit on someone"...</font>

784
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:52,576
<font color="yellow">- A playboy? - A playboy.</font>

785
00:40:52,676 --> 00:40:53,876
<font color="yellow">He's a real scumbag.</font>

786
00:40:54,306 --> 00:40:55,346
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

787
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:58,106
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of myself. Don't worry.</font>

788
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:02,306
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

789
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:04,416
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

790
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:15,376
<font color="yellow">Good thing Director Yang will be coming here.</font>

791
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:16,546
<font color="yellow">I can't go out with Joon looking like that.</font>

792
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,976
<font color="yellow">That's how much I look like a gangster.</font>

793
00:41:19,046 --> 00:41:21,546
<font color="yellow">It's because you're embarrassing.</font>

794
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,706
<font color="yellow">What are you going to tell him?</font>

795
00:41:24,276 --> 00:41:25,306
<font color="yellow">We need to be straightforward.</font>

796
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:27,476
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell him that we should stick to the original script.</font>

797
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,076
<font color="yellow">Let's start talking.</font>

798
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:38,976
<font color="yellow">By the way, shouldn't we be drinking...</font>

799
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,276
<font color="yellow">when we're talking about the script?</font>

800
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:43,646
<font color="yellow">Do you have any malt whiskey at home?</font>

801
00:41:43,976 --> 00:41:46,076
<font color="yellow">Director, about that edited script...</font>

802
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:49,846
<font color="yellow">Don't call it that. It's our new script now.</font>

803
00:41:49,976 --> 00:41:51,276
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to change anything about it now.</font>

804
00:41:51,646 --> 00:41:52,676
<font color="yellow">How did you like it?</font>

805
00:41:53,046 --> 00:41:55,176
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I couldn't understand it.</font>

806
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:58,746
<font color="yellow">I can't understand that you don't understand it.</font>

807
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:01,006
<font color="yellow">What could you not understand about it?</font>

808
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:04,076
<font color="yellow">- It's the female role. - I wasn't asking you.</font>

809
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:06,106
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

810
00:42:07,446 --> 00:42:09,706
<font color="yellow">The female role stands out too much that it overshadows Lim Hwa Su.</font>

811
00:42:09,706 --> 00:42:10,946
<font color="yellow">And it's nothing like the true story.</font>

812
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,346
<font color="yellow">We're not doing a documentary here.</font>

813
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:14,146
<font color="yellow">I changed it like that to give it a cinematic aspect.</font>

814
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:16,706
<font color="yellow">Then why is the movie called, "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

815
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:19,006
<font color="yellow">It's a story about some actress from the 1950s.</font>

816
00:42:19,646 --> 00:42:22,246
<font color="yellow">What does a mere manager know about movies?</font>

817
00:42:22,346 --> 00:42:24,706
<font color="yellow">Are managers not allowed to have their say? Let go of me.</font>

818
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,276
<font color="yellow">Frankly, the original script was much better than this.</font>

819
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:28,276
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

820
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:32,706
<font color="yellow">Gosh, find yourself a new director, then.</font>

821
00:42:32,706 --> 00:42:33,746
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

822
00:42:34,106 --> 00:42:36,746
<font color="yellow">- I quit. - Suit yourself.</font>

823
00:42:37,306 --> 00:42:40,376
<font color="yellow">Director Yang. Please.</font>

824
00:42:40,576 --> 00:42:43,076
<font color="yellow">- Ho Jin. - He started it.</font>

825
00:42:45,306 --> 00:42:47,076
<font color="yellow">I get it. I'll go talk to him.</font>

826
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:57,746
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to him? Is he going to change it back?</font>

827
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,176
<font color="yellow">We're going with the new script.</font>

828
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,416
<font color="yellow">What did you say just now?</font>

829
00:43:05,576 --> 00:43:07,606
<font color="yellow">He has his intentions.</font>

830
00:43:08,076 --> 00:43:10,106
<font color="yellow">Stop being so negative and take a look at it again.</font>

831
00:43:10,106 --> 00:43:11,446
<font color="yellow">Don't be so judgmental.</font>

832
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:14,246
<font color="yellow">You're the one who can't see clearly.</font>

833
00:43:15,046 --> 00:43:17,246
<font color="yellow">You're trusting him way too much.</font>

834
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:18,846
<font color="yellow">He's trustworthy.</font>

835
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:21,006
<font color="yellow">You said so yourself that you like his movies.</font>

836
00:43:21,446 --> 00:43:22,746
<font color="yellow">Don't you trust me?</font>

837
00:43:24,676 --> 00:43:27,046
<font color="yellow">You just don't like him for who he is.</font>

838
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,176
<font color="yellow">Think whatever you like.</font>

839
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:31,776
<font color="yellow">Where are you going now?</font>

840
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,546
<font color="yellow">I have to go take care of something for Lee El. What?</font>

841
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:35,476
<font color="yellow">But we're not done here.</font>

842
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:37,446
<font color="yellow">You're going to do what Director Yang tells you to anyway.</font>

843
00:43:37,446 --> 00:43:39,276
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want with "Lim Hwa Su". I don't care anymore.</font>

844
00:43:39,276 --> 00:43:40,606
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

845
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,646
<font color="yellow">Do you only work with that person now?</font>

846
00:43:42,806 --> 00:43:45,046
<font color="yellow">Yes. She actually listens to me. Are you satisfied?</font>

847
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,046
<font color="yellow">- Director Yang. - Yes?</font>

848
00:43:55,746 --> 00:43:56,746
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

849
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,546
<font color="yellow">I got a tattoo.</font>

850
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:02,176
<font color="yellow">- You got that? - Yes.</font>

851
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:05,506
<font color="yellow">Lee Choon Bong is pretentious and narcissistic.</font>

852
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:09,376
<font color="yellow">So I thought he'd have a tattoo of his own name.</font>

853
00:44:10,176 --> 00:44:11,546
<font color="yellow">Is this real?</font>

854
00:44:12,076 --> 00:44:14,146
<font color="yellow">It's not henna. It's a real tattoo.</font>

855
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:15,976
<font color="yellow">That's amazing.</font>

856
00:44:16,646 --> 00:44:17,706
<font color="yellow">You flatter me.</font>

857
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:20,846
<font color="yellow">This is the least an actor could do to get into character.</font>

858
00:44:20,946 --> 00:44:24,046
<font color="yellow">I am Lee Choon Bong and Lee Choon Bong is me.</font>

859
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:25,806
<font color="yellow">I am one with Lee Choon Bong.</font>

860
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:27,306
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

861
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,676
<font color="yellow">("I'm Just Me")</font>

862
00:44:29,676 --> 00:44:31,906
<font color="yellow">These are all scripts for variety shows.</font>

863
00:44:32,976 --> 00:44:34,446
<font color="yellow">Do you not have any movie scripts?</font>

864
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,506
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

865
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:40,206
<font color="yellow">Wait. You're Horse Lady Cha Joon?</font>

866
00:44:40,646 --> 00:44:43,346
<font color="yellow">- He's also known as Mr. Prostate. - I see.</font>

867
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:46,176
<font color="yellow">I've never seen that show.</font>

868
00:44:46,846 --> 00:44:47,846
<font color="yellow">It's pretty funny.</font>

869
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:50,676
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

870
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:53,506
<font color="yellow">how long are you going to do variety shows?</font>

871
00:44:53,706 --> 00:44:55,476
<font color="yellow">Actors shouldn't do variety shows.</font>

872
00:44:56,076 --> 00:44:57,446
<font color="yellow">It gives actors comical images.</font>

873
00:44:58,176 --> 00:44:59,576
<font color="yellow">You said you want to do method acting.</font>

874
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:01,406
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be funny.</font>

875
00:45:17,046 --> 00:45:19,006
<font color="yellow">Come on. Have a drink.</font>

876
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:21,946
<font color="yellow">It's just that I'm working right now.</font>

877
00:45:22,746 --> 00:45:24,276
<font color="yellow">May I have your signature?</font>

878
00:45:25,276 --> 00:45:26,306
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sign it.</font>

879
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:30,906
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll sign it right now...</font>

880
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:32,906
<font color="yellow">if you knock this back.</font>

881
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:34,606
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

882
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,306
<font color="yellow">But that's...</font>

883
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,676
<font color="yellow">You're really stubborn, aren't you?</font>

884
00:45:41,476 --> 00:45:43,106
<font color="yellow">I thought you were the cute type.</font>

885
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:45,506
<font color="yellow">You should listen to me.</font>

886
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,106
<font color="yellow">Women should listen to men.</font>

887
00:45:48,506 --> 00:45:49,846
<font color="yellow">Excuse me,</font>

888
00:45:49,976 --> 00:45:53,806
<font color="yellow">but women don't have to listen to men.</font>

889
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:58,876
<font color="yellow">You're adorable. My gosh.</font>

890
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:00,846
<font color="yellow">You're my manager, right?</font>

891
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:03,476
<font color="yellow">You just need to listen to me.</font>

892
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:06,846
<font color="yellow">Bottoms up.</font>

893
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:13,176
<font color="yellow">If you don't drink this, I won't sign the contract.</font>

894
00:46:14,046 --> 00:46:15,746
<font color="yellow">Can you imagine how furious Eun Gab will be?</font>

895
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:23,346
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

896
00:46:29,946 --> 00:46:31,976
<font color="yellow">There you go. It's not bad, is it?</font>

897
00:46:34,076 --> 00:46:35,106
<font color="yellow">Sit next to me.</font>

898
00:46:37,476 --> 00:46:38,676
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Come on.</font>

899
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:41,976
<font color="yellow">Where are you? I've been waiting for you forever.</font>

900
00:46:42,706 --> 00:46:45,106
<font color="yellow">I'm almost there. I just need to cross the bridge.</font>

901
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:47,646
<font color="yellow">You sound happy. Did you sign him today?</font>

902
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,376
<font color="yellow">Yes, he dragged on for long, but he signed it eventually.</font>

903
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:52,976
<font color="yellow">He should be signing it as we speak.</font>

904
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:56,546
<font color="yellow">Let's go somewhere fancy tonight. I'll be there soon.</font>

905
00:46:57,476 --> 00:46:58,546
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

906
00:47:07,076 --> 00:47:08,076
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

907
00:47:08,606 --> 00:47:09,646
<font color="yellow">He signed the contract, right?</font>

908
00:47:09,646 --> 00:47:12,446
<font color="yellow">Yes, but the thing is...</font>

909
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:15,006
<font color="yellow">I think he's very drunk.</font>

910
00:47:15,676 --> 00:47:19,906
<font color="yellow">He keeps making me drink. He won't let me go home.</font>

911
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:23,746
<font color="yellow">What? You should've left after you got his signature.</font>

912
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,276
<font color="yellow">You said you'd take care of it.</font>

913
00:47:27,246 --> 00:47:30,506
<font color="yellow">He said we had to celebrate.</font>

914
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:33,676
<font color="yellow">He's contracted with our agency now.</font>

915
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:37,346
<font color="yellow">I couldn't refuse.</font>

916
00:47:37,446 --> 00:47:38,576
<font color="yellow">Just get out of there.</font>

917
00:47:38,946 --> 00:47:41,306
<font color="yellow">How will I ever trust him with you now?</font>

918
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:44,346
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

919
00:47:44,906 --> 00:47:46,206
<font color="yellow">Did you drink a lot, too?</font>

920
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:49,846
<font color="yellow">Yes, but...</font>

921
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,346
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of myself.</font>

922
00:47:53,446 --> 00:47:55,346
<font color="yellow">I'll do well. Don't worry.</font>

923
00:47:57,046 --> 00:47:58,076
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

924
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,506
<font color="yellow">Are you hanging up on me now?</font>

925
00:48:03,346 --> 00:48:05,246
<font color="yellow">It doesn't sound like you're taking care of it.</font>

926
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:08,906
<font color="yellow">Do I have to go over there? Gosh.</font>

927
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:11,506
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

928
00:48:11,906 --> 00:48:13,876
<font color="yellow">That scumbag.</font>

929
00:48:14,546 --> 00:48:16,246
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

930
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:38,446
<font color="yellow">You're cute.</font>

931
00:48:38,706 --> 00:48:39,746
<font color="yellow">Chang Seok.</font>

932
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:41,476
<font color="yellow">Hey, Eun Gab.</font>

933
00:48:41,946 --> 00:48:43,076
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

934
00:48:44,376 --> 00:48:46,876
<font color="yellow">I thought I should have a drink with you.</font>

935
00:48:47,976 --> 00:48:49,946
<font color="yellow">Let's send her home. You're busy, aren't you? Go home.</font>

936
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:53,346
<font color="yellow">Why would you send her home? I like the mood right now.</font>

937
00:48:55,846 --> 00:48:57,276
<font color="yellow">I like the mood, too.</font>

938
00:48:58,346 --> 00:48:59,376
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

939
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:05,106
<font color="yellow">What is this, Eun Gab?</font>

940
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,876
<font color="yellow">You talk like I'm going to do something to her.</font>

941
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,046
<font color="yellow">I don't mind it,</font>

942
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,246
<font color="yellow">but other people might get the wrong idea.</font>

943
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,046
<font color="yellow">You should be careful not to get involved in scandals.</font>

944
00:49:13,276 --> 00:49:16,706
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, let's have a guy be your manager.</font>

945
00:49:17,846 --> 00:49:19,146
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

946
00:49:20,076 --> 00:49:21,476
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

947
00:49:24,376 --> 00:49:27,076
<font color="yellow">You sure know how to tick someone off.</font>

948
00:49:27,406 --> 00:49:28,406
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

949
00:49:29,006 --> 00:49:30,406
<font color="yellow">Let's not get vulgar.</font>

950
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:33,676
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab.</font>

951
00:49:34,376 --> 00:49:35,806
<font color="yellow">Is this how you treat me right after I sign the contract?</font>

952
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:38,976
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be good to me if I signed it.</font>

953
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:42,276
<font color="yellow">Where's that contract again?</font>

954
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:49,076
<font color="yellow">I'm not signing you. Let's call it off.</font>

955
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:52,506
<font color="yellow">You only pretend to be a gentleman on screen.</font>

956
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:55,746
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to sign a dog in heat like you.</font>

957
00:49:58,146 --> 00:49:59,276
<font color="yellow">Don't you try this again with any other person.</font>

958
00:50:00,076 --> 00:50:01,576
<font color="yellow">I'll go talk to the reporters.</font>

959
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:03,506
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

960
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:12,306
<font color="yellow">Why you little...</font>

961
00:50:13,206 --> 00:50:14,246
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

962
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:17,346
<font color="yellow">Is this really okay? We had to go through trouble to sign him.</font>

963
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:20,576
<font color="yellow">Forget it. The last thing we need is a lowly scumbag like him.</font>

964
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:22,346
<font color="yellow">Did you drink a lot?</font>

965
00:50:23,746 --> 00:50:24,976
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

966
00:50:25,846 --> 00:50:27,006
<font color="yellow">Follow me. I'll give you a ride.</font>

967
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:31,976
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

968
00:50:32,076 --> 00:50:33,246
<font color="yellow">There are...</font>

969
00:50:33,706 --> 00:50:35,446
<font color="yellow">way more good-natured actors like Young Bin.</font>

970
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:36,906
<font color="yellow">Have some patience. I'll make you a manager one day.</font>

971
00:50:37,606 --> 00:50:38,606
<font color="yellow">A manager?</font>

972
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:40,876
<font color="yellow">Manager Joy? Are you serious?</font>

973
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,746
<font color="yellow">Do you do drugs?</font>

974
00:50:42,746 --> 00:50:44,106
<font color="yellow">Are you bipolar or something?</font>

975
00:50:44,106 --> 00:50:47,546
<font color="yellow">One moment, you're upset and suddenly, you're nice.</font>

976
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:48,876
<font color="yellow">You're like that, too.</font>

977
00:50:49,306 --> 00:50:51,846
<font color="yellow">But you were so cool back there.</font>

978
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:52,876
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

979
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:54,346
<font color="yellow">Don't be rude.</font>

980
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:57,676
<font color="yellow">How am I going to explain this to my wife?</font>

981
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:00,046
<font color="yellow">I got a call from Mr. Ahn. Stay right there.</font>

982
00:51:00,546 --> 00:51:01,576
<font color="yellow">I have a missed call.</font>

983
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:04,046
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Ahn. You called?</font>

984
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:06,306
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim. Aren't we going fishing?</font>

985
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:09,346
<font color="yellow">Fine. Let's go fishing.</font>

986
00:51:09,446 --> 00:51:12,706
<font color="yellow">By the way, a big investor wants to meet up.</font>

987
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:14,276
<font color="yellow">I'm going to meet him today to decide.</font>

988
00:51:14,276 --> 00:51:15,506
<font color="yellow">Really? Where are you?</font>

989
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:18,546
<font color="yellow">Oh, there he is. I'll call you back.</font>

990
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:19,846
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

991
00:51:23,676 --> 00:51:24,706
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

992
00:51:32,346 --> 00:51:33,506
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat. - Thank you.</font>

993
00:51:37,076 --> 00:51:38,746
<font color="yellow">You must've been surprised when I said I wanted to meet.</font>

994
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:43,306
<font color="yellow">I was. I thought you weren't interested in "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

995
00:51:44,076 --> 00:51:46,876
<font color="yellow">Not at all. We used to be the main investing company.</font>

996
00:51:47,246 --> 00:51:50,246
<font color="yellow">We did bail out, but we've always been interested.</font>

997
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:52,406
<font color="yellow">- I see. - Do you have a director?</font>

998
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,746
<font color="yellow">You've probably heard of Mr. Yang Man Ho.</font>

999
00:51:56,846 --> 00:51:58,976
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mr. Yang. He's a good director.</font>

1000
00:51:58,976 --> 00:52:00,006
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1001
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:03,446
<font color="yellow">I'm expecting a lot from him. He has a distinct philosophy.</font>

1002
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:05,376
<font color="yellow">He can also be a lunatic.</font>

1003
00:52:06,576 --> 00:52:08,046
<font color="yellow">It's better than being ordinary.</font>

1004
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,476
<font color="yellow">Such actors and directors get the job done.</font>

1005
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:12,046
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

1006
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:15,306
<font color="yellow">I've always wanted to work with him. I hope I do this time.</font>

1007
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:19,046
<font color="yellow">Whom do you have in mind for the role of Lim Hwa Su?</font>

1008
00:52:19,746 --> 00:52:21,046
<font color="yellow">We have an actor already.</font>

1009
00:52:21,476 --> 00:52:23,246
<font color="yellow">You've heard of Cha Young Bin, right?</font>

1010
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:26,176
<font color="yellow">- Oh, Cha Young Bin? - Yes.</font>

1011
00:52:35,646 --> 00:52:38,146
<font color="yellow">Did you go over the script?</font>

1012
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,476
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1013
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:42,176
<font color="yellow">I didn't like it that you wanted to see me without my manager,</font>

1014
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:44,176
<font color="yellow">but I liked the script, so here I am.</font>

1015
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:45,906
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.</font>

1016
00:52:46,806 --> 00:52:50,346
<font color="yellow">When I was working on my script, I was thinking about you.</font>

1017
00:52:51,106 --> 00:52:54,346
<font color="yellow">I've always considered you as a talented actor.</font>

1018
00:52:54,676 --> 00:52:57,106
<font color="yellow">You're only a rookie, but you're so good.</font>

1019
00:52:57,846 --> 00:52:59,046
<font color="yellow">You're fearless.</font>

1020
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,046
<font color="yellow">Most importantly, you're so beautiful.</font>

1021
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,806
<font color="yellow">You don't have a boyfriend, do you?</font>

1022
00:53:04,476 --> 00:53:05,576
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

1023
00:53:08,406 --> 00:53:11,446
<font color="yellow">- You're playing Lim Hwa Su, right? - Yes.</font>

1024
00:53:11,446 --> 00:53:14,076
<font color="yellow">I'm such a big fan. You look much better in person.</font>

1025
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:15,746
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

1026
00:53:17,146 --> 00:53:20,276
<font color="yellow">How can an actress be a fan of another actor?</font>

1027
00:53:20,506 --> 00:53:23,846
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. Young Bin isn't the good-looking type.</font>

1028
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:25,706
<font color="yellow">He's about average.</font>

1029
00:53:26,346 --> 00:53:29,376
<font color="yellow">Compared to actors like Won Bin and Kang Dong Won,</font>

1030
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:30,906
<font color="yellow">he's on the ugly side.</font>

1031
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:35,646
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

1032
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,406
<font color="yellow">No, he's not.</font>

1033
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:39,306
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is much better looking.</font>

1034
00:53:39,946 --> 00:53:41,046
<font color="yellow">How do you like me?</font>

1035
00:53:41,546 --> 00:53:43,646
<font color="yellow">- What? - Oh, I didn't mean it that way.</font>

1036
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:46,776
<font color="yellow">How do you like me as your partner? Do I fit the role?</font>

1037
00:53:47,646 --> 00:53:51,376
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. It's Director Yang's opinion that matters.</font>

1038
00:53:51,876 --> 00:53:53,346
<font color="yellow">Do you have a girlfriend?</font>

1039
00:53:55,976 --> 00:53:58,346
<font color="yellow">- Am I coming off as rude? - No, I don't have one.</font>

1040
00:53:58,646 --> 00:54:01,076
<font color="yellow">Why not? Rumor has it that you're quite the lady's man.</font>

1041
00:54:01,606 --> 00:54:04,306
<font color="yellow">You always end up dating the female actress of your movies.</font>

1042
00:54:04,676 --> 00:54:07,876
<font color="yellow">Was it An So Hee? That's right. You've dated her.</font>

1043
00:54:08,806 --> 00:54:09,846
<font color="yellow">Are you drunk?</font>

1044
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,146
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

1045
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:14,276
<font color="yellow">Let me make this clear just in case.</font>

1046
00:54:14,776 --> 00:54:17,376
<font color="yellow">Actors should only be focused on their acting.</font>

1047
00:54:17,676 --> 00:54:19,806
<font color="yellow">I don't tolerate their getting romantically involved.</font>

1048
00:54:20,076 --> 00:54:21,606
<font color="yellow">You can't call someone like that an actor.</font>

1049
00:54:22,476 --> 00:54:24,106
<font color="yellow">Someone like that is a scumbag.</font>

1050
00:54:25,606 --> 00:54:27,906
<font color="yellow">A playboy. That's all.</font>

1051
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,006
<font color="yellow">I really hope you work on that.</font>

1052
00:54:33,046 --> 00:54:34,046
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1053
00:54:51,806 --> 00:54:52,806
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

1054
00:54:53,406 --> 00:54:54,846
<font color="yellow">How did things go with the script for "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

1055
00:54:56,606 --> 00:54:59,246
<font color="yellow">Young Bin said he'll take care of it.</font>

1056
00:54:59,406 --> 00:55:00,946
<font color="yellow">Take care of what?</font>

1057
00:55:01,706 --> 00:55:03,846
<font color="yellow">- Did you two fight? - No, it's not like that.</font>

1058
00:55:04,376 --> 00:55:05,476
<font color="yellow">Is he with you now?</font>

1059
00:55:06,246 --> 00:55:07,576
<font color="yellow">No, I'm at work right now.</font>

1060
00:55:07,876 --> 00:55:09,946
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with Lee El.</font>

1061
00:55:10,076 --> 00:55:12,146
<font color="yellow">But I've been waiting for three hours now.</font>

1062
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:16,776
<font color="yellow">She said she'd be back from dinner, but she hasn't called back yet.</font>

1063
00:55:16,776 --> 00:55:19,576
<font color="yellow">She's never on time.</font>

1064
00:55:20,046 --> 00:55:22,106
<font color="yellow">She thinks her manager should always wait for her.</font>

1065
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,446
<font color="yellow">Get an answer from her about the drama.</font>

1066
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:26,076
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - By the way,</font>

1067
00:55:26,476 --> 00:55:28,376
<font color="yellow">don't forget we're going fishing with Mr. Ahn tomorrow.</font>

1068
00:55:30,306 --> 00:55:31,306
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1069
00:55:51,506 --> 00:55:53,476
<font color="yellow">Hello, Lee El. I'm Manager Lee.</font>

1070
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:57,746
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now? Are you still at the dinner?</font>

1071
00:55:57,746 --> 00:56:00,506
<font color="yellow">Yes. I don't think I can make it today.</font>

1072
00:56:00,606 --> 00:56:01,976
<font color="yellow">Can we do the meeting tomorrow?</font>

1073
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:05,946
<font color="yellow">Yes. I guess it can't be helped.</font>

1074
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,106
<font color="yellow">By the way, what are your thoughts on the drama?</font>

1075
00:56:09,106 --> 00:56:10,676
<font color="yellow">You said you'd give me an answer by today.</font>

1076
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:14,006
<font color="yellow">I don't want to do it. Keep looking for something else.</font>

1077
00:56:14,476 --> 00:56:15,506
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1078
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:18,276
<font color="yellow">Why all of a sudden?</font>

1079
00:56:18,776 --> 00:56:21,806
<font color="yellow">My mom says it's too serious and boring.</font>

1080
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:24,106
<font color="yellow">I want to do romantic comedy or just romance.</font>

1081
00:56:26,406 --> 00:56:27,746
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

1082
00:56:28,376 --> 00:56:29,906
<font color="yellow">Have a good night.</font>

1083
00:56:41,006 --> 00:56:42,346
<font color="yellow">He's still hitting on her.</font>

1084
00:56:42,576 --> 00:56:44,176
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? He's so weird.</font>

1085
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:45,976
<font color="yellow">I don't know anymore.</font>

1086
00:56:48,506 --> 00:56:52,106
<font color="yellow">Just let it go, Joon. You'll feel much better.</font>

1087
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:53,606
<font color="yellow">I even got a tattoo.</font>

1088
00:56:54,946 --> 00:56:56,846
<font color="yellow">It feels like I'm branded for not getting the role.</font>

1089
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,406
<font color="yellow">Are you really not going to do variety shows?</font>

1090
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:00,806
<font color="yellow">He says he doesn't like actors doing variety shows.</font>

1091
00:57:01,776 --> 00:57:03,006
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating.</font>

1092
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:06,876
<font color="yellow">It hasn't even been a month since I started.</font>

1093
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:09,076
<font color="yellow">I've worked so hard for it.</font>

1094
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,246
<font color="yellow">What's going on here? Why are you all so down?</font>

1095
00:57:24,306 --> 00:57:25,446
<font color="yellow">I thought you said you weren't coming?</font>

1096
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:30,046
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be happy to see Lee El,</font>

1097
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:31,846
<font color="yellow">but you don't look like it at all.</font>

1098
00:57:31,946 --> 00:57:33,046
<font color="yellow">She doesn't listen to me.</font>

1099
00:57:33,806 --> 00:57:35,106
<font color="yellow">I thought you said she listens to you.</font>

1100
00:57:36,006 --> 00:57:37,746
<font color="yellow">She values her mom's opinions more than mine.</font>

1101
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:39,546
<font color="yellow">Nobody listens to me.</font>

1102
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,276
<font color="yellow">You have me.</font>

1103
00:57:43,906 --> 00:57:46,676
<font color="yellow">You also have that mom of yours that you listen to more.</font>

1104
00:57:47,576 --> 00:57:48,846
<font color="yellow">Where is that mom of yours?</font>

1105
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:55,006
<font color="yellow">- Who's that girl? - She's a rookie actress.</font>

1106
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:58,476
<font color="yellow">I think he wants to make her the female lead.</font>

1107
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,476
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1108
00:58:01,406 --> 00:58:03,606
<font color="yellow">- He'll give it to a rookie? - That's what I'm saying.</font>

1109
00:58:06,146 --> 00:58:07,806
<font color="yellow">Goodness gracious.</font>

1110
00:58:09,046 --> 00:58:10,476
<font color="yellow">Can I go talk to him?</font>

1111
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:13,906
<font color="yellow">- Don't fight with him. - I can't promise you that.</font>

1112
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,806
<font color="yellow">Where's she going? She's coming here.</font>

1113
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:19,306
<font color="yellow">Why is she?</font>

1114
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:23,406
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin. - Oh, yes.</font>

1115
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:26,046
<font color="yellow">I'll get going. He's pretty drunk now.</font>

1116
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:27,506
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

1117
00:58:27,646 --> 00:58:28,876
<font color="yellow">- See you soon. - See you.</font>

1118
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:31,206
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

1119
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:40,306
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

1120
00:58:41,046 --> 00:58:42,046
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

1121
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:49,046
<font color="yellow">What do you want? Why are you here?</font>

1122
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,706
<font color="yellow">I'm here because I'm his manager.</font>

1123
00:58:50,976 --> 00:58:52,376
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking...</font>

1124
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:54,976
<font color="yellow">and I think we should talk about the script.</font>

1125
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:57,676
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what do you want from me?</font>

1126
00:58:58,106 --> 00:59:01,506
<font color="yellow">Your opinion doesn't matter so don't even talk to me.</font>

1127
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:04,646
<font color="yellow">I know that you're not fond of me, but we should still talk...</font>

1128
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:10,276
<font color="yellow">We should still talk. Don't you think so?</font>

1129
00:59:11,846 --> 00:59:13,246
<font color="yellow">I read through it.</font>

1130
00:59:13,976 --> 00:59:17,076
<font color="yellow">Won't it change the direction entirely? What's your take on it?</font>

1131
00:59:17,776 --> 00:59:18,776
<font color="yellow">Okay!</font>

1132
00:59:19,446 --> 00:59:21,076
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get rid of that female character.</font>

1133
00:59:23,276 --> 00:59:25,146
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - Why?</font>

1134
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:29,506
<font color="yellow">I can't find an actress who can portray that character well.</font>

1135
00:59:29,706 --> 00:59:31,346
<font color="yellow">That girl won't be good enough.</font>

1136
00:59:31,376 --> 00:59:33,176
<font color="yellow">So I'll just go with the original script.</font>

1137
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:35,076
<font color="yellow">You're fine with it, right?</font>

1138
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,846
<font color="yellow">- And I bet you're thankful. - Well...</font>

1139
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:40,976
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

1140
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:43,876
<font color="yellow">I'm fine with everything, but there's one problem.</font>

1141
00:59:44,906 --> 00:59:45,906
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

1142
00:59:46,706 --> 00:59:50,746
<font color="yellow">I can't work with you if you keep being disrespectful to my manager.</font>

1143
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:52,006
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1144
00:59:55,976 --> 00:59:57,206
<font color="yellow">I heard that you two are friends.</font>

1145
00:59:57,776 --> 01:00:00,806
<font color="yellow">Is this about your loyalty to your friend?</font>

1146
01:00:02,446 --> 01:00:05,446
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, you should study the script of "Lim Hwa Su" again.</font>

1147
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:10,506
<font color="yellow">Do you think the film is about gang loyalty? Not at all.</font>

1148
01:00:11,376 --> 01:00:12,746
<font color="yellow">Betrayal and ambition.</font>

1149
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:14,976
<font color="yellow">That's what the film is about.</font>

1150
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:22,776
<font color="yellow">I won't be disrespectful to you from now on, Mr. Lee.</font>

1151
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:24,806
<font color="yellow">Are we good now?</font>

1152
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:26,846
<font color="yellow">All is good now, right?</font>

1153
01:00:28,076 --> 01:00:30,306
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I need to go relieve myself.</font>

1154
01:00:32,976 --> 01:00:35,946
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I just can't get along with him. Goodness.</font>

1155
01:00:36,606 --> 01:00:37,646
<font color="yellow">He really rubs me the wrong way.</font>

1156
01:00:38,246 --> 01:00:41,076
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm glad that he's sticking with the original script.</font>

1157
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:46,776
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she's waiting outside.</font>

1158
01:00:51,806 --> 01:00:52,906
<font color="yellow">Why are you out here?</font>

1159
01:00:53,706 --> 01:00:55,676
<font color="yellow">You're too much. What took you so long?</font>

1160
01:00:55,846 --> 01:00:57,346
<font color="yellow">I even had to cancel the reservation for dinner.</font>

1161
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,146
<font color="yellow">Don't even get me started. All sorts of things happened.</font>

1162
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:01,946
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you everything over a delicious dinner.</font>

1163
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:05,346
<font color="yellow">- It's Mr. Ahn. - Again? Don't answer it.</font>

1164
01:01:05,346 --> 01:01:06,776
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm sure it's nothing.</font>

1165
01:01:07,576 --> 01:01:11,076
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm on my way to have dinner with my wife. Let's keep it short.</font>

1166
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:13,906
<font color="yellow">Did something happen between Ms. Jo and Young Bin?</font>

1167
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:15,606
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo?</font>

1168
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,006
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1169
01:01:21,406 --> 01:01:22,406
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

1170
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:23,776
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

1171
01:01:25,046 --> 01:01:26,206
<font color="yellow">I've made up my mind.</font>

1172
01:01:28,306 --> 01:01:30,076
<font color="yellow">I won't do any more variety shows.</font>

1173
01:01:30,376 --> 01:01:32,806
<font color="yellow">Really? You made the right decision.</font>

1174
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:36,676
<font color="yellow">- Then the role, Lee Choon Bong... - No.</font>

1175
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:39,976
<font color="yellow">You look too feeble for that character.</font>

1176
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:44,106
<font color="yellow">Someone like Ma Dong Seok should play that role.</font>

1177
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:46,876
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm looking for. A tough guy.</font>

1178
01:01:48,006 --> 01:01:50,206
<font color="yellow">It's a supporting role, so I'm not too confident,</font>

1179
01:01:50,976 --> 01:01:53,346
<font color="yellow">but I'm still going to send the script to Ma Dong Seok.</font>

1180
01:01:53,906 --> 01:01:55,006
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1181
01:01:55,606 --> 01:01:58,506
<font color="yellow">Director, Joon has anger management issues...</font>

1182
01:01:58,606 --> 01:02:00,346
<font color="yellow">so he can look like a psycho when he loses it.</font>

1183
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:03,076
<font color="yellow">In what way?</font>

1184
01:02:05,146 --> 01:02:09,176
<font color="yellow">To be honest with you, a gangster role doesn't suit you.</font>

1185
01:02:09,876 --> 01:02:11,806
<font color="yellow">You're not charismatic at all.</font>

1186
01:02:13,506 --> 01:02:15,346
<font color="yellow">And you're too tall.</font>

1187
01:02:16,376 --> 01:02:18,406
<font color="yellow">You'd make a great punching bag. Don't you agree?</font>

1188
01:02:19,546 --> 01:02:20,546
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1189
01:02:23,446 --> 01:02:27,606
<font color="yellow">Well... How about the Actor Number Two role?</font>

1190
01:02:31,746 --> 01:02:33,746
<font color="yellow">Gosh, another insignificant role?</font>

1191
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:39,976
<font color="yellow">Why are you chugging down my drink?</font>

1192
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:43,706
<font color="yellow">Yes, you would be perfect for that role.</font>

1193
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:48,076
<font color="yellow">That character is a cowardly guy who likes to bluff.</font>

1194
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:49,606
<font color="yellow">You'll be good at it.</font>

1195
01:02:50,546 --> 01:02:51,546
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1196
01:02:53,406 --> 01:02:56,706
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I get hot whenever I drink.</font>

1197
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,176
<font color="yellow">I went through hoops to get that.</font>

1198
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,776
<font color="yellow">So? Do you have a problem with it?</font>

1199
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:07,706
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1200
01:03:11,306 --> 01:03:14,346
<font color="yellow">Joon went through a lot to get this hat.</font>

1201
01:03:16,476 --> 01:03:19,046
<font color="yellow">Joon, this is why you haven't made a name for yourself yet.</font>

1202
01:03:20,106 --> 01:03:23,476
<font color="yellow">Do you think that a hat can complete an actor's performance?</font>

1203
01:03:23,776 --> 01:03:25,706
<font color="yellow">Does your acting rely on props or what?</font>

1204
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,576
<font color="yellow">You must use your body. It has to come naturally.</font>

1205
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,246
<font color="yellow">Why is this hat so important to you?</font>

1206
01:03:33,406 --> 01:03:34,906
<font color="yellow">Please don't throw it around.</font>

1207
01:03:42,406 --> 01:03:44,076
<font color="yellow">- You did it again. - What's your problem?</font>

1208
01:03:46,146 --> 01:03:48,206
<font color="yellow">I went through so much trouble to get that hat for the role,</font>

1209
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:50,276
<font color="yellow">and I even got a tattoo for it.</font>

1210
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:53,376
<font color="yellow">- Come on, Joon. Are you drunk? - No, I'm not.</font>

1211
01:03:54,946 --> 01:03:56,806
<font color="yellow">You said you'd give me the role...</font>

1212
01:03:56,806 --> 01:03:58,946
<font color="yellow">then kept changing your words. And what now?</font>

1213
01:04:00,276 --> 01:04:01,276
<font color="yellow">What's your problem?</font>

1214
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:03,676
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with doing variety shows?</font>

1215
01:04:05,246 --> 01:04:06,676
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with this hat?</font>

1216
01:04:08,246 --> 01:04:10,276
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you look like a total lunatic.</font>

1217
01:04:12,306 --> 01:04:13,376
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is funny?</font>

1218
01:04:14,506 --> 01:04:15,876
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a joke?</font>

1219
01:04:17,776 --> 01:04:19,846
<font color="yellow">You said that I look like a punching bag. Get up!</font>

1220
01:04:21,976 --> 01:04:23,406
<font color="yellow">Get up and check for yourself.</font>

1221
01:04:25,676 --> 01:04:26,676
<font color="yellow">You're laughing again?</font>

1222
01:04:27,706 --> 01:04:28,706
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

1223
01:04:32,976 --> 01:04:33,976
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1224
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,206
<font color="yellow">Take the Lee Choon Bong role. I like this.</font>

1225
01:04:38,506 --> 01:04:39,506
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

1226
01:04:41,776 --> 01:04:44,076
<font color="yellow">You can have the Lee Choon Bong role, you lunatic.</font>

1227
01:04:44,706 --> 01:04:48,406
<font color="yellow">Actors should be like that. That was great. You're pretty good.</font>

1228
01:04:52,276 --> 01:04:55,376
<font color="yellow">Director, you're not going to forget that you said this, right?</font>

1229
01:04:56,746 --> 01:04:59,276
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I think I need to record this.</font>

1230
01:04:59,376 --> 01:05:01,406
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. Go sit beside him. - Okay.</font>

1231
01:05:01,776 --> 01:05:02,806
<font color="yellow">All right. Get ready.</font>

1232
01:05:03,476 --> 01:05:04,476
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

1233
01:05:04,946 --> 01:05:07,346
<font color="yellow">Could you please repeat what you just said?</font>

1234
01:05:08,176 --> 01:05:10,206
<font color="yellow">- Please go ahead. It's rolling. - Goodness.</font>

1235
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:13,676
<font color="yellow">You psycho. You can have the Lee Choon Bong role. Is that good?</font>

1236
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:16,576
<font color="yellow">Joon, say something.</font>

1237
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,406
<font color="yellow">- Go, "Lim Hwa Su"! - What are you doing?</font>

1238
01:05:19,506 --> 01:05:21,476
<font color="yellow">- "Lim Hwa Su" rocks! - No, say your name.</font>

1239
01:05:21,476 --> 01:05:23,606
<font color="yellow">I, Cha Joon...</font>

1240
01:05:24,006 --> 01:05:26,046
<font color="yellow">- He gave me Lee Choon Bong... - Gosh.</font>

1241
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:27,776
<font color="yellow">- I'm having second thoughts. - Please...</font>

1242
01:05:27,846 --> 01:05:29,176
<font color="yellow">- It's already saved. - You saved it?</font>

1243
01:05:29,276 --> 01:05:31,176
<font color="yellow">- You're too goofy. - Not at all.</font>

1244
01:05:39,006 --> 01:05:40,646
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hey.</font>

1245
01:05:41,306 --> 01:05:42,346
<font color="yellow">Why are you guys out here?</font>

1246
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:45,976
<font color="yellow">Joon wanted to talk with Director Yang alone.</font>

1247
01:05:46,506 --> 01:05:49,746
<font color="yellow">I told you guys that the psycho director would cause trouble.</font>

1248
01:05:50,006 --> 01:05:51,546
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Why? What happened?</font>

1249
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:55,346
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ahn told me that they've managed to secure an investor.</font>

1250
01:05:57,176 --> 01:05:58,206
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

1251
01:05:58,776 --> 01:06:00,876
<font color="yellow">It's Ms. Jo's idea. Goodness.</font>

1252
01:06:01,576 --> 01:06:02,706
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - How did that happen?</font>

1253
01:06:03,976 --> 01:06:07,076
<font color="yellow">It happened because the director wanted a bigger production budget.</font>

1254
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,646
<font color="yellow">They obviously needed a big company.</font>

1255
01:06:10,576 --> 01:06:14,606
<font color="yellow">She apparently said that she'd fund the entire project if you're out.</font>

1256
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,206
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1257
01:06:51,846 --> 01:06:53,246
<font color="yellow">(Entourage)</font>

1258
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:55,546
<font color="yellow">I really want to do it.</font>

1259
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:57,576
<font color="yellow">Isn't he letting people take photos of him on purpose?</font>

1260
01:06:57,646 --> 01:06:59,946
<font color="yellow">It's not like that will change Jo Tae Young's mind.</font>

1261
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:01,906
<font color="yellow">We're getting so many offers.</font>

1262
01:07:01,946 --> 01:07:02,946
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo...</font>

1263
01:07:02,946 --> 01:07:05,376
<font color="yellow">- Casting for "Lim Hwa Su"... - We're working on it.</font>

1264
01:07:05,476 --> 01:07:07,176
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to get out of unemployment.</font>

1265
01:07:07,376 --> 01:07:08,376
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

1266
01:07:08,746 --> 01:07:09,746
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Gosh.</font>

1267
01:07:09,746 --> 01:07:10,776
<font color="yellow">I'm shooting a commercial.</font>

1268
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:12,146
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is this?</font>

1269
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:14,079
<font color="yellow">You didn't come with Young Bin today?</font>

1270
01:07:14,104 --> 01:07:15,174
<font color="yellow">I came alone.</font>

1271
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:16,806
<font color="yellow">I think you're a good person.</font>

1272
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,151
<font color="yellow">What should I do to make you forgive me?</font>

1273
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:21,751
<font color="yellow">Do you know the real reason?</font>
