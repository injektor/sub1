- Cha Young Bin.</font>

5
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:34,046
<font color="yellow">This is no Pokemon. Is there Squirtle?</font>

6
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:35,375
<font color="yellow">You looked like a shot-putter.</font>

7
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:37,822
<font color="yellow">I thought you threw a grenade.
You'll be shooting a war movie.</font>

8
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:39,446
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time. That's why.</font>

9
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:41,576
<font color="yellow">You're a successful actor.</font>

10
00:00:41,686 --> 00:00:43,766
<font color="yellow">"The Flowers of Evil" attracted
six million viewers.</font>

11
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:44,852
<font color="yellow">I have no high expectations.</font>

12
00:00:44,876 --> 00:00:46,045
<font color="yellow">- You mean the movie?
- I mean his throwing.</font>

13
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,046
<font color="yellow">He wasn't good with balls as a kid, either.</font>

14
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:50,116
<font color="yellow">He only watched television
and movies at home.</font>

15
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,016
<font color="yellow">You were right there next to me.</font>

16
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:53,716
<font color="yellow">By the way, I'm surprised.</font>

17
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,146
<font color="yellow">I thought the movie would fail big time.</font>

18
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:58,545
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to Young Bin.</font>

19
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:00,866
<font color="yellow">It's also because there are no
strong opponents right now.</font>

20
00:01:00,946 --> 00:01:02,446
<font color="yellow">You're right. I was lucky.</font>

21
00:01:03,776 --> 00:01:05,216
<font color="yellow">"You're right. I was lucky."</font>

22
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,776
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

23
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,216
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- That's Cha Young Bin.</font>

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,516
<font color="yellow">Cha Young Bin?</font>

25
00:01:13,846 --> 00:01:16,216
<font color="yellow">Can we take a picture together?</font>

26
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,316
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

27
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:21,976
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

28
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,316
<font color="yellow">You can take one, too.</font>

29
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:25,916
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

30
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,316
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid. I'll show you something.</font>

31
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,415
<font color="yellow">I'll show you a light-speed ball.</font>

32
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,716
<font color="yellow">- You'll hurt yourself.
- Go ahead.</font>

33
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:39,416
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>

34
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,036
<font color="yellow">His position looks nice at least.</font>

35
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,876
<font color="yellow">Look at his eyes.</font>

36
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:44,176
<font color="yellow">Is someone giving him signs?</font>

37
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:46,416
<font color="yellow">- Look at those eyes.
- Who's giving you signs?</font>

38
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,146
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
- What are you doing?</font>

39
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:03,016
<font color="yellow">Should we call an ambulance?</font>

40
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:07,346
<font color="yellow">When is Kim Kwang Hyun coming?
We need his help.</font>

41
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:09,816
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

42
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:12,046
<font color="yellow">have you been practicing?</font>

43
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,446
<font color="yellow">Yes, but it's hard.
Please give me some tips.</font>

44
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:16,676
<font color="yellow">Just hold the ball and throw it.</font>

45
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:22,446
<font color="yellow">I'm your fan. Can I be honest?</font>

46
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:23,676
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

47
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,392
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't be like this if I was a girl.</font>

48
00:02:25,416 --> 00:02:26,576
<font color="yellow">You would try your best.</font>

49
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:29,776
<font color="yellow">I know a lot of female celebrities.</font>

50
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,246
<font color="yellow">Do you know An So Hee, too?</font>

51
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,146
<font color="yellow">I do. We're close.</font>

52
00:02:39,046 --> 00:02:40,646
<font color="yellow">Let's start our practice then.</font>

53
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:49,176
<font color="yellow">It still hurts.</font>

54
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,076
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, please come with me.</font>

55
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:54,446
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Is it time?</font>

56
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,846
<font color="yellow">You don't have to get nervous.</font>

57
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:05,046
<font color="yellow">- He's getting nervous.
- What's with him?</font>

58
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:08,916
<font color="yellow">- Are you okay?
- Of course.</font>

59
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,376
<font color="yellow">- You don't seem okay.
- Young Bin.</font>

60
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,646
<font color="yellow">- Good luck!
- Good luck!</font>

61
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:15,646
<font color="yellow">Good luck!</font>

62
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,676
<font color="yellow">The first ball will be...</font>

63
00:03:30,746 --> 00:03:32,276
<font color="yellow">thrown by Actor Cha Young Bin...</font>

64
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:35,146
<font color="yellow">who recently appeared in the
movie, "The Flowers of Evil".</font>

65
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:37,146
<font color="yellow">Please give him a big hand.</font>

66
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,746
<font color="yellow">My back is killing me.</font>

67
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,076
<font color="yellow">You tried too hard to
impress those cheerleaders.</font>

68
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,746
<font color="yellow">That was so humiliating.</font>

69
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:41,392
<font color="yellow">There's something even more humiliating.</font>

70
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,136
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin went to see his ex-girlfriend
and ran into her new boyfriend.</font>

71
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,746
<font color="yellow">She said he was just a friend.</font>

72
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:47,886
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

73
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,946
<font color="yellow">Also, I don't care even if
he's her new boyfriend.</font>

74
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,816
<font color="yellow">I know you're upset.</font>

75
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,616
<font color="yellow">I'll set you up with all the girls I know.</font>

76
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,352
<font color="yellow">You'll get a hot girlfriend soon.</font>

77
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:02,046
<font color="yellow">Find a hot girl for yourself first.</font>

78
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,346
<font color="yellow">I don't want a girlfriend
for the time being.</font>

79
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:05,776
<font color="yellow">Hey, kid.</font>

80
00:05:06,346 --> 00:05:08,646
<font color="yellow">To get over a girl, you need a new girl.</font>

81
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,116
<font color="yellow">That sounds so old.</font>

82
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,476
<font color="yellow">I'm busy with work.</font>

83
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,776
<font color="yellow">I can't even take care of myself. Stop now.</font>

84
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,616
<font color="yellow">Have you given up on getting a girlfriend?</font>

85
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,376
<font color="yellow">Do you know what will happen?</font>

86
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:21,946
<font color="yellow">You'll end up like him.</font>

87
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,016
<font color="yellow">- Take that back.
- I take it back.</font>

88
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:28,616
<font color="yellow">- Take that back.
- I take it back.</font>

89
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:31,746
<font color="yellow">When I was your age, I had so many girls.</font>

90
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:34,346
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Who would believe that?</font>

91
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,645
<font color="yellow">If you find a girl you like,
we'll be your wing-men.</font>

92
00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:38,716
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

93
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,046
<font color="yellow">Who are you texting to by the way?</font>

94
00:05:41,176 --> 00:05:43,446
<font color="yellow">It's just a fan.</font>

95
00:05:44,946 --> 00:05:46,076
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she answering?</font>

96
00:05:46,876 --> 00:05:49,316
<font color="yellow">There you go again. Are you
still not over So Hee?</font>

97
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,416
<font color="yellow">Just show up in front
of her like Ho Jin did.</font>

98
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:52,976
<font color="yellow">Don't drag me down to his level.</font>

99
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:54,616
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

100
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:56,822
<font color="yellow">An article has been published about today.</font>

101
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,516
<font color="yellow">"He looked like a professional."</font>

102
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:00,876
<font color="yellow">- Wait.
- What's wrong?</font>

103
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:02,976
<font color="yellow">Is the reporter crazy?</font>

104
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,746
<font color="yellow">They blurred my face.</font>

105
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,716
<font color="yellow">That's so humiliating.</font>

106
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:12,816
<font color="yellow">They didn't know you are an actor.</font>

107
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,576
<font color="yellow">Did they think you were his stylist?</font>

108
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:17,016
<font color="yellow">Or a fan?</font>

109
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,846
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

110
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,815
<font color="yellow">That happens.</font>

111
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,816
<font color="yellow">He's right.</font>

112
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:26,276
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

113
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,375
<font color="yellow">They probably thought
your face looked strange.</font>

114
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,116
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

115
00:06:32,546 --> 00:06:34,146
<font color="yellow">I didn't pass the audition,</font>

116
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,216
<font color="yellow">and my management company
doesn't care about me.</font>

117
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:41,216
<font color="yellow">Hey. I'll ask Eun Gab to
give you more auditions.</font>

118
00:06:41,246 --> 00:06:43,316
<font color="yellow">- I'll talk to him, too.
- Me, too.</font>

119
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:55,716
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

120
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,876
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!</font>

121
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,216
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

122
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:02,076
<font color="yellow">- Go, Young Bin!
- Go, Young Bin!</font>

123
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,546
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

124
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,946
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations!
- We made it!</font>

125
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:09,276
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!</font>

126
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:11,122
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your movie's success.</font>

127
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:12,816
<font color="yellow">- We made it!
- Congratulations.</font>

128
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,846
<font color="yellow">- Congratulations.
- Thank you.</font>

129
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,976
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

130
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,246
<font color="yellow">Hi, Young Bin.</font>

131
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,446
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

132
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:23,146
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
- Me?</font>

133
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,046
<font color="yellow">I work here. I work for Mr. Kim.</font>

134
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,216
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

135
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,916
<font color="yellow">- Is Mr. Kim in?
- Yes.</font>

136
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,776
<font color="yellow">By the way, you look better in real life.</font>

137
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:32,346
<font color="yellow">Can I take a picture with you?</font>

138
00:07:32,446 --> 00:07:33,446
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

139
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:38,446
<font color="yellow">Are you going to ask every celebrity
to take a picture with you?</font>

140
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:40,316
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about her. Go in.</font>

141
00:07:40,446 --> 00:07:42,316
<font color="yellow">- Let's do it later.
- Okay.</font>

142
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:46,546
<font color="yellow">You two wait here.</font>

143
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,592
<font color="yellow">I told you not to try getting
closer to the celebrities.</font>

144
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:51,345
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're at a
signing event or something?</font>

145
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,546
<font color="yellow">What did I do so wrong?</font>

146
00:07:53,376 --> 00:07:55,846
<font color="yellow">By the way, Mr. Kim, I
want to be a manager.</font>

147
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:57,522
<font color="yellow">How long do I have to work at this office?</font>

148
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:59,776
<font color="yellow">You still have to wait a bit.</font>

149
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,576
<font color="yellow">Also, what was that? Are
you a hip hop singer?</font>

150
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,076
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

151
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,346
<font color="yellow">- You grumpy old man.
- What?</font>

152
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:08,816
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

153
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:14,716
<font color="yellow">Is she new? She seems unusual.</font>

154
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:17,216
<font color="yellow">She's too unusual. She's
giving me a headache.</font>

155
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:19,446
<font color="yellow">How do you feel?</font>

156
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:21,776
<font color="yellow">Your first movie became a huge success.</font>

157
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,316
<font color="yellow">I guess you're feeling like when
you first slept with a girl.</font>

158
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:26,176
<font color="yellow">I really didn't expect this.</font>

159
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:29,546
<font color="yellow">I know. I didn't expect it, either.</font>

160
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:31,316
<font color="yellow">It feels like I suddenly found out...</font>

161
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:35,076
<font color="yellow">there's an inheritance meant for
me that I had no idea about.</font>

162
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,946
<font color="yellow">Here. This is to celebrate your success.</font>

163
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:40,046
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

164
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:41,946
<font color="yellow">We should renew the contract.</font>

165
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:44,376
<font color="yellow">Note the changed percentage
and the down payment.</font>

166
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:45,946
<font color="yellow">Don't be surprised.</font>

167
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,516
<font color="yellow">It's a lot.</font>

168
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:51,876
<font color="yellow">The real present...</font>

169
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,486
<font color="yellow">is here.</font>

170
00:08:53,986 --> 00:08:55,876
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Take a look.</font>

171
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,046
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure it's okay?
- Take a look.</font>

172
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,646
<font color="yellow">Is this a script? "War Terminator"?</font>

173
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:02,176
<font color="yellow">"War Terminator".</font>

174
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:05,646
<font color="yellow">It's a hero movie like "The Avengers".</font>

175
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:07,246
<font color="yellow">- A hero movie?
- Yes.</font>

176
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:08,516
<font color="yellow">What is it about?</font>

177
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,446
<font color="yellow">It's set at the time of
the Japanese Invasion.</font>

178
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:15,446
<font color="yellow">Admiral Yi Sun Sin succeeds to
terminate the war with help of...</font>

179
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:17,316
<font color="yellow">a tiger, a nine-tailed
fox and a death angel.</font>

180
00:09:17,676 --> 00:09:19,676
<font color="yellow">I don't think a Korean
hero movie will work.</font>

181
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:22,846
<font color="yellow">Just give it a read.</font>

182
00:09:22,986 --> 00:09:24,716
<font color="yellow">I went through so much...</font>

183
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:27,646
<font color="yellow">to get you this role.</font>

184
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:28,906
<font color="yellow">Who's the production company?</font>

185
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,916
<font color="yellow">Idea. CJ Entertainment
will be a co-investor.</font>

186
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:34,486
<font color="yellow">- Idea?
- Really?</font>

187
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:37,016
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lim quit?</font>

188
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,436
<font color="yellow">He set up his own company
after receiving investments.</font>

189
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:41,276
<font color="yellow">He took all his actors and actresses.</font>

190
00:09:41,376 --> 00:09:43,216
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim is furious about it.</font>

191
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:46,246
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

192
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,576
<font color="yellow">I was his actor, too.</font>

193
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,216
<font color="yellow">Doesn't the CEO hate me? After
what happened in Busan.</font>

194
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:57,746
<font color="yellow">What happened in Busan?</font>

195
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,486
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

196
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:05,046
<font color="yellow">Your movie is a huge success.
You're a star now.</font>

197
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:06,616
<font color="yellow">Who wouldn't want you?</font>

198
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,746
<font color="yellow">They're very excited about it.</font>

199
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,376
<font color="yellow">That's great. Then tell them I
want to be in "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

200
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,576
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

201
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,976
<font color="yellow">That's over. They found another actor.</font>

202
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:24,846
<font color="yellow">I'll persuade the CEO.</font>

203
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,016
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

204
00:10:26,646 --> 00:10:28,946
<font color="yellow">If you try to sleep with your ex-wife,</font>

205
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,246
<font color="yellow">she'll sue you. You'll be charged.</font>

206
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:34,116
<font color="yellow">As you said, "The Flowers
of Evil" became a success.</font>

207
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,546
<font color="yellow">That's why you can do this.</font>

208
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:40,116
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, they would have wanted
either Yoo Ah In or Song Joong Ki.</font>

209
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:42,746
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand?
- Please let me meet her then.</font>

210
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:43,976
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to her.</font>

211
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:46,116
<font color="yellow">- About "War Terminator"?
- About "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

212
00:10:46,516 --> 00:10:49,316
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin, what's with you?
- Please.</font>

213
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:52,446
<font color="yellow">I appreciate your presents,
but I want "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

214
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,546
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going.
- Young Bin.</font>

215
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:55,916
<font color="yellow">You always walk out on me.</font>

216
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:59,716
<font color="yellow">Make it happen.</font>

217
00:11:08,746 --> 00:11:10,276
<font color="yellow">You might be able to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

218
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:12,416
<font color="yellow">She probably forgot about Joon's butt.</font>

219
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:14,746
<font color="yellow">What's up with Joon?</font>

220
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,546
<font color="yellow">He's frozen.</font>

221
00:11:31,616 --> 00:11:34,316
<font color="yellow">He took all the young actors
and actresses with him.</font>

222
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,246
<font color="yellow">You're too old.</font>

223
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,776
<font color="yellow">This is no time for joking around.</font>

224
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:42,176
<font color="yellow">My bad luck doesn't seem to end.</font>

225
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:45,546
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll find you a new manager.</font>

226
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:49,946
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, you already have a nice car.</font>

227
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,306
<font color="yellow">With the movie's success,
I can afford this much.</font>

228
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:55,216
<font color="yellow">You haven't signed the next movie yet.</font>

229
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:56,546
<font color="yellow">Which do you like the most?</font>

230
00:11:57,646 --> 00:12:00,116
<font color="yellow">I don't know much about cars. You choose.</font>

231
00:12:03,146 --> 00:12:04,146
<font color="yellow">I'd recommend...</font>

232
00:12:04,616 --> 00:12:08,416
<font color="yellow">a Lamborghini.</font>

233
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,916
<font color="yellow">G-Dragon owns one, too.</font>

234
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,576
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

235
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,716
<font color="yellow">it'll suit you very well.</font>

236
00:12:21,546 --> 00:12:22,616
<font color="yellow">It's too expensive.</font>

237
00:12:22,846 --> 00:12:24,376
<font color="yellow">Choose something cheaper.</font>

238
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,146
<font color="yellow">Why are you telling me? Tell Young Bin.</font>

239
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,846
<font color="yellow">- You should choose.
- Why?</font>

240
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:34,946
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

241
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:38,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Lucky you.</font>

242
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:41,976
<font color="yellow">You'll get to own such a nice car.</font>

243
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,152
<font color="yellow">Let only girls get in your car.</font>

244
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,176
<font color="yellow">- Don't ever let Turtle get in.
- What's going on?</font>

245
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,446
<font color="yellow">It's for you.</font>

246
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,715
<font color="yellow">- What?
- It's to celebrate...</font>

247
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,156
<font color="yellow">my movie's success and your breakup.</font>

248
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,146
<font color="yellow">- Choose one.
- Forget it.</font>

249
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:54,816
<font color="yellow">You looked so happy saying that.</font>

250
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:56,976
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

251
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,716
<font color="yellow">Your car is a piece of trash.
Get a new one now.</font>

252
00:12:59,776 --> 00:13:00,776
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

253
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:03,046
<font color="yellow">It still works fine.</font>

254
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,446
<font color="yellow">Just think of it as me
letting you drive my car.</font>

255
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:06,576
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

256
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,096
<font color="yellow">You don't deserve a car like this yet.</font>

257
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,146
<font color="yellow">Would you like to test-drive?</font>

258
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,276
<font color="yellow">I can explain the details to you.</font>

259
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,376
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

260
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:24,746
<font color="yellow">Isn't it nice?</font>

261
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,916
<font color="yellow">We're just test-driving.</font>

262
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:29,616
<font color="yellow">It's so fast.</font>

263
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:32,146
<font color="yellow">Hey, just admit that you want it.</font>

264
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:34,446
<font color="yellow">It's like your turning down Seol Hyun...</font>

265
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,516
<font color="yellow">or Son Na Eun when they ask you out.</font>

266
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:41,076
<font color="yellow">- Should I just take it?
- Isn't it too fast?</font>

267
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,646
<font color="yellow">It's too fast!</font>

268
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:45,276
<font color="yellow">Let's go!</font>

269
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:00,316
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>

270
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:04,146
<font color="yellow">I did grocery shopping on the way.</font>

271
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,876
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

272
00:14:08,216 --> 00:14:10,416
<font color="yellow">It's a mink cactus. It's
popular these days.</font>

273
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,176
<font color="yellow">Every actress owns one. Do you know why?</font>

274
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:14,676
<font color="yellow">It resembles man's...</font>

275
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,116
<font color="yellow">You know.</font>

276
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:18,816
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ho Jin.</font>

277
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:23,722
<font color="yellow">Have you heard anything from Eun Gab yet?</font>

278
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:25,386
<font color="yellow">He said he'd let me meet the CEO of Idea.</font>

279
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:26,776
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard anything yet.</font>

280
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:30,046
<font color="yellow">- Have you heard anything about me?
- No.</font>

281
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:33,016
<font color="yellow">They seem to have completely
forgotten about me.</font>

282
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:35,156
<font color="yellow">Should I transfer to another company?</font>

283
00:14:36,446 --> 00:14:39,546
<font color="yellow">By the way, stop sending me on an errand.</font>

284
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,346
<font color="yellow">It's on your way anyway.</font>

285
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,836
<font color="yellow">Live with us if you have a problem with it.</font>

286
00:14:44,376 --> 00:14:46,776
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should. I can
barely afford my rents.</font>

287
00:14:46,876 --> 00:14:49,146
<font color="yellow">Really? Then move in with me.</font>

288
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,416
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

289
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:52,422
<font color="yellow">Have you given up playing hard to get?
That's good news.</font>

290
00:14:52,446 --> 00:14:55,345
<font color="yellow">- Just like the old days.
- I'm still thinking.</font>

291
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,046
<font color="yellow">Let's move to a place with a nice view.</font>

292
00:14:57,116 --> 00:14:58,516
<font color="yellow">- Call a realtor.
- Now?</font>

293
00:14:58,646 --> 00:14:59,646
<font color="yellow">Right now.</font>

294
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,746
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

295
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:07,246
<font color="yellow">Will we get to live in UN Village?</font>

296
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,286
<font color="yellow">This is perfect for celebrities.
It's so safe.</font>

297
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:11,356
<font color="yellow">No one will know even if you bring girls.</font>

298
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:12,876
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

299
00:15:23,676 --> 00:15:24,976
<font color="yellow">Now, we're talking.</font>

300
00:15:28,016 --> 00:15:30,946
<font color="yellow">Moving is really not necessary.</font>

301
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:35,046
<font color="yellow">Don't think I'll let you sleep in my room.</font>

302
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:39,446
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you making
love with your hand, either.</font>

303
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,976
<font color="yellow">What do you think? I quite like it.</font>

304
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:44,646
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

305
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,576
<font color="yellow">Which actresses live here?</font>

306
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,876
<font color="yellow">We might run into them.</font>

307
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:52,646
<font color="yellow">How much is this place?</font>

308
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:54,616
<font color="yellow">It's 1.8 million dollars.</font>

309
00:15:54,676 --> 00:15:56,076
<font color="yellow">- What?
- That much?</font>

310
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:57,876
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

311
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:00,346
<font color="yellow">It's too expensive.</font>

312
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:01,976
<font color="yellow">I'll sign a new movie soon.</font>

313
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:05,776
<font color="yellow">You don't know yet if you'll
get to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

314
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:07,876
<font color="yellow">It's Eun Gab. Just in time.</font>

315
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,246
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

316
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:12,746
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

317
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:15,746
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you tomorrow.</font>

318
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,576
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

319
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,046
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

320
00:16:21,076 --> 00:16:22,646
<font color="yellow">I'm meeting the CEO of Idea tomorrow.</font>

321
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,576
<font color="yellow">Will it be all right?</font>

322
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,116
<font color="yellow">Think about what happened in Busan.</font>

323
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:30,216
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to her tomorrow.</font>

324
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,276
<font color="yellow">Let's put our place on sale.
We'll move as soon as I sign.</font>

325
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:35,046
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Just a second.</font>

326
00:16:35,146 --> 00:16:37,376
<font color="yellow">Take your time. We don't know anything yet.</font>

327
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,216
<font color="yellow">Be positive. I'm a lucky guy.</font>

328
00:16:41,846 --> 00:16:44,016
<font color="yellow">Be positive. He's a lucky guy.</font>

329
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:53,946
<font color="yellow">They have a nicer office
than investment companies.</font>

330
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:57,046
<font color="yellow">I told you. They run a
20-million-dollar fund.</font>

331
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,376
<font color="yellow">They're just like an investment company.</font>

332
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:03,916
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo isn't scared of
huge companies, either.</font>

333
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,876
<font color="yellow">- She even dates a celebrity.
- Who?</font>

334
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,316
<font color="yellow">You know, from the movie...</font>

335
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,576
<font color="yellow">- Please come this way.
- Okay.</font>

336
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:15,076
<font color="yellow">Let's see what she has to say, okay?</font>

337
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,606
<font color="yellow">Cup Noodles, don't say anything stupid.</font>

338
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:18,976
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

339
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:21,716
<font color="yellow">Cup Noodles?</font>

340
00:17:22,846 --> 00:17:24,776
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Yes, hello.</font>

341
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:26,122
<font color="yellow">This is Young Bin, Cha Young Bin.</font>

342
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,186
<font color="yellow">- Nice to meet you, Mr. Cha.
- Nice to meet you.</font>

343
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,346
<font color="yellow">We met at the Busan International
Film Festival, right?</font>

344
00:17:32,446 --> 00:17:33,966
<font color="yellow">Did you attend the event hosted by CJ?</font>

345
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,016
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

346
00:17:36,446 --> 00:17:37,946
<font color="yellow">It's too bad I couldn't attend it.</font>

347
00:17:38,146 --> 00:17:40,786
<font color="yellow">It would've been great if I had
introduced you to Young Bin there.</font>

348
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,716
<font color="yellow">I know. It's too bad, indeed.</font>

349
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,276
<font color="yellow">- Let's stop talking about Busan.
- Okay.</font>

350
00:17:46,346 --> 00:17:48,322
<font color="yellow">What did you think of the
script for "War Terminator"?</font>

351
00:17:48,346 --> 00:17:49,346
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

352
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,566
<font color="yellow">Before we talk about that...</font>

353
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:56,146
<font color="yellow">The preparation for the film, "Lim
Hwa Su", is going well, right?</font>

354
00:17:56,546 --> 00:17:58,346
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is interested in it.</font>

355
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:02,186
<font color="yellow">To be frank, I'm more interested
in it than "War Terminator".</font>

356
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,316
<font color="yellow">She might get the wrong idea
if you put it that way.</font>

357
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,116
<font color="yellow">I thought we were meeting today to
discuss "War Terminator", Mr. Kim.</font>

358
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:12,686
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course. That's why we're here.</font>

359
00:18:12,776 --> 00:18:14,616
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is just saying...</font>

360
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:17,946
<font color="yellow">that he's interested in both films
you're preparing currently.</font>

361
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,436
<font color="yellow">He's just interested. That's all.</font>

362
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,192
<font color="yellow">We already finished casting
all roles for "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

363
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:24,116
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me?
- I see.</font>

364
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:26,346
<font color="yellow">Then let's stop talking about "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

365
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,686
<font color="yellow">Please tell him more
about "War Terminator".</font>

366
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,352
<font color="yellow">The amount allocated for its
production budget is unprecedented.</font>

367
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,946
<font color="yellow">And your pay will be high, too.</font>

368
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,186
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jo. I'm sorry to interrupt,</font>

369
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,476
<font color="yellow">but I heard that there are
four main characters.</font>

370
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:41,192
<font color="yellow">We revised the plot of the novel
which the script is based on.</font>

371
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,876
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee Woo Hyuk agreed, too.</font>

372
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:45,792
<font color="yellow">The story will revolve around
one character, Black Tiger.</font>

373
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:48,576
<font color="yellow">I'd love to cast you for that role.</font>

374
00:18:49,216 --> 00:18:52,216
<font color="yellow">- Black Tiger...
- Black Tiger...</font>

375
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:53,616
<font color="yellow">You said "tiger", right?</font>

376
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:56,016
<font color="yellow">Tiger?</font>

377
00:18:56,376 --> 00:18:57,916
<font color="yellow">Yes, that tiger.</font>

378
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:00,376
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

379
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,746
<font color="yellow">It's not just any tiger. I
mean, it's Black Tiger.</font>

380
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:06,146
<font color="yellow">Hey, Young Bin. Wait.</font>

381
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,422
<font color="yellow">They already finished
casting for "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

382
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,186
<font color="yellow">It's gone out the window.</font>

383
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,076
<font color="yellow">Why are you so hung up on it?</font>

384
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,076
<font color="yellow">Hey, Young Bin. Please.</font>

385
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,386
<font color="yellow">I came here because of "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

386
00:19:17,186 --> 00:19:18,776
<font color="yellow">You've been stubborn,</font>

387
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:21,392
<font color="yellow">so I brought you here so that we
can ask her about it at least.</font>

388
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,422
<font color="yellow">You heard what she said about
the production budget, right?</font>

389
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,722
<font color="yellow">You also heard what your pay will be like.</font>

390
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,592
<font color="yellow">It's like having a Miss
Korea winner wanting...</font>

391
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,092
<font color="yellow">to move in with you when you were
just looking for a cute girl.</font>

392
00:19:29,116 --> 00:19:31,876
<font color="yellow">Did you not hear what she said?
She wants me to be a tiger.</font>

393
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:35,076
<font color="yellow">She won't make you wear a tiger mask.
It's not a kid's movie.</font>

394
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:38,346
<font color="yellow">The original plot has been revised a lot.
Just read the script, okay?</font>

395
00:19:38,716 --> 00:19:40,676
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested. I'll
look for something else.</font>

396
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:43,876
<font color="yellow">I guarantee that "War Terminator"
will attract 10 million viewers.</font>

397
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:46,686
<font color="yellow">Compared to "Lim Hwa Su",
"War Terminator" is like...</font>

398
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,662
<font color="yellow">that expensive imported
spring water, Fiji Water.</font>

399
00:19:48,686 --> 00:19:50,392
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if that was
a good use of analogy.</font>

400
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,736
<font color="yellow">I don't want to play Black Tiger.</font>

401
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,546
<font color="yellow">Hey, Young Bin.</font>

402
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,746
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin.
- Young Bin.</font>

403
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:00,046
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with him?
He didn't even say goodbye.</font>

404
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:02,186
<font color="yellow">That means he's very angry.</font>

405
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,476
<font color="yellow">I've never seen him like that.</font>

406
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:06,916
<font color="yellow">He thought he'd be able to get
a role in "Lim Hwa Su", but...</font>

407
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:09,846
<font color="yellow">Did he not read "War Terminator"?</font>

408
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,992
<font color="yellow">No. He doesn't read things that
he's not interested in, you know.</font>

409
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,016
<font color="yellow">You didn't read it, either?</font>

410
00:20:13,017 --> 00:20:14,992
<font color="yellow">No. I also thought this
meeting was for "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

411
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,816
<font color="yellow">This happened because you showed
him the script for "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

412
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:20,766
<font color="yellow">Do not show him any scripts
without my permission. Got it?</font>

413
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:22,916
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

414
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,186
<font color="yellow">Go persuade Young Bin.</font>

415
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,976
<font color="yellow">And you must read the script, too.</font>

416
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,476
<font color="yellow">Pretend it's pornography you
used to watch as a teenager...</font>

417
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,346
<font color="yellow">so that you can get all excited about it.</font>

418
00:20:32,076 --> 00:20:34,746
<font color="yellow">You have to like
the script first, you fool.</font>

419
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,376
<font color="yellow">Have a good day.</font>

420
00:20:57,746 --> 00:20:59,346
<font color="yellow">Turtle, someone is here!</font>

421
00:21:02,446 --> 00:21:04,476
<font color="yellow">- Who is it?
- They're from the realtor's office.</font>

422
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:05,746
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

423
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:28,176
<font color="yellow">Girls.</font>

424
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,246
<font color="yellow">Go through everything.</font>

425
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,592
<font color="yellow">Those crazy fans. I want to
report them to the police.</font>

426
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:49,322
<font color="yellow">They really pretend to be realtors
and go through everything...</font>

427
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:51,292
<font color="yellow">when celebrities list their
places on the market.</font>

428
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:52,316
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

429
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,392
<font color="yellow">They opened every drawer and
took photos of everything.</font>

430
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:56,176
<font color="yellow">- Also...
- I won't pass any auditions.</font>

431
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,916
<font color="yellow">They took Turtle's lucky underwear
thinking that it's yours.</font>

432
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,446
<font color="yellow">Call the realtor and cancel it.</font>

433
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:03,576
<font color="yellow">Because of this?</font>

434
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,952
<font color="yellow">I didn't get the role in the film.
We can't move.</font>

435
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,546
<font color="yellow">- How did that happen?
- I don't want to talk about it.</font>

436
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:11,176
<font color="yellow">- Where is Ho Jin?
- He went home.</font>

437
00:22:11,646 --> 00:22:13,126
<font color="yellow">That underwear is so important to me.</font>

438
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,756
<font color="yellow">It's handed down from my dad...</font>

439
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,596
<font color="yellow">Things are already bad enough for me.</font>

440
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:20,916
<font color="yellow">What's Ho Jin going to do? It's
not like he can live in a tent.</font>

441
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:22,726
<font color="yellow">Shall we fix up one of the dressing rooms?</font>

442
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,276
<font color="yellow">That's a good idea. Do you
know any interior designers?</font>

443
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:26,916
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

444
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:30,716
<font color="yellow">It's Ho Jin.</font>

445
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:42,906
<font color="yellow">We just saw each other.
Why are you summoning me like this?</font>

446
00:22:43,246 --> 00:22:44,316
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me already?</font>

447
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:46,376
<font color="yellow">Cut it out.</font>

448
00:22:48,146 --> 00:22:49,386
<font color="yellow">What are Turtle and Joon up to?</font>

449
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:54,146
<font color="yellow">Joon is going through social media
to find who stole his underwear.</font>

450
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:58,016
<font color="yellow">We haven't been here in ages.</font>

451
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:02,415
<font color="yellow">We came here often when you were
broke trying to produce films.</font>

452
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:03,976
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

453
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:07,246
<font color="yellow">We used to come here often when
you were unpopular and broke.</font>

454
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:10,546
<font color="yellow">Is something going on?</font>

455
00:23:11,746 --> 00:23:14,266
<font color="yellow">We always meet here when you have
something serious to tell me.</font>

456
00:23:18,276 --> 00:23:20,216
<font color="yellow">The script for "War Terminator".</font>

457
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,976
<font color="yellow">- You haven't read it yet, right?
- No.</font>

458
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:27,516
<font color="yellow">I just read it, and it's
actually better than I expected.</font>

459
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:28,916
<font color="yellow">It's not tacky.</font>

460
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,146
<font color="yellow">I think you should do it.</font>

461
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,516
<font color="yellow">I was wondering what you were going to say.</font>

462
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:36,946
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Let's just drink.</font>

463
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,016
<font color="yellow">Just read it.</font>

464
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,876
<font color="yellow">Would you want to wear tiger makeup?</font>

465
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,446
<font color="yellow">As Mr. Kim said, they won't
make you wear a tiger mask.</font>

466
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:47,576
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they'll use computer
graphics or special effects.</font>

467
00:23:48,576 --> 00:23:50,746
<font color="yellow">They'll make it look cool.
Give it some thought.</font>

468
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,126
<font color="yellow">Why are you being like this suddenly?</font>

469
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,916
<font color="yellow">Did Eun Gab say that he'll promote you?</font>

470
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,476
<font color="yellow">I read it because Mr. Kim was going
on about it, and it's really good.</font>

471
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:01,916
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm telling you this.</font>

472
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,816
<font color="yellow">No, I don't want to do it.</font>

473
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,346
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

474
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:10,546
<font color="yellow">Hey, would you date a girl whom
you're not even attracted to?</font>

475
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,722
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
Are you copying Mr. Kim now?</font>

476
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:14,046
<font color="yellow">That analogy doesn't even work.</font>

477
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:16,276
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

478
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,436
<font color="yellow">I can't be in the film I wanted to do.</font>

479
00:24:20,716 --> 00:24:22,836
<font color="yellow">I'm not in a good mood,
so let's not talk about work.</font>

480
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:29,676
<font color="yellow">Can you just think about it...</font>

481
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,616
<font color="yellow">Just go through it once...</font>

482
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:35,776
<font color="yellow"><i>(SO HEE)</i></font>

483
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:40,546
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you call me sooner?</font>

484
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,246
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I was so busy that I
forgot to message you back.</font>

485
00:24:44,076 --> 00:24:46,676
<font color="yellow">- It's okay.
- Congratulations. The film's a hit.</font>

486
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,276
<font color="yellow">We should all get together soon.</font>

487
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,546
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll be in touch soon.</font>

488
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,746
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

489
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:54,776
<font color="yellow">Was it So Hee?</font>

490
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:56,346
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

491
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,052
<font color="yellow">- What did she say?
- She wants to go for food with us.</font>

492
00:24:59,076 --> 00:25:00,916
<font color="yellow">With everyone. You, Joon, Turtle, and me.</font>

493
00:25:02,776 --> 00:25:04,646
<font color="yellow">Are you bipolar or what?</font>

494
00:25:05,276 --> 00:25:06,822
<font color="yellow">You were grimacing until a few seconds ago,</font>

495
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,616
<font color="yellow">but you're grinning from ear to ear now.
Are you all right?</font>

496
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:12,576
<font color="yellow">You know actors have serious mood swings.</font>

497
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,516
<font color="yellow">Give me the bottle.</font>

498
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,626
<font color="yellow">Stop being so stubborn and read it...</font>

499
00:25:21,946 --> 00:25:23,676
<font color="yellow">Enough. Let's just drink, please.</font>

500
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,476
<font color="yellow">Fine, drink all you want.</font>

501
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:33,646
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Turtle has
found the underwear yet.</font>

502
00:25:34,016 --> 00:25:35,916
<font color="yellow">- I don't know.
- He's so obsessed with it.</font>

503
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:43,646
<font color="yellow">You fell here a long time ago
and almost broke your head.</font>

504
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:47,816
<font color="yellow">You tripped right here.</font>

505
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,516
<font color="yellow">You should thank me.</font>

506
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:04,692
<font color="yellow">- Did you see?
- Don't roll your eyes like that.</font>

507
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:07,356
<font color="yellow">- I saw one in black. How about you?
- I saw one in black stripes.</font>

508
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:09,415
<font color="yellow">It took me less than a second.
I have excellent vision.</font>

509
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:11,346
<font color="yellow">I knew you had it in you.</font>

510
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:13,296
<font color="yellow">Where's the designer we're supposed to see?</font>

511
00:26:13,616 --> 00:26:14,852
<font color="yellow">Are you sure she's good as she says?</font>

512
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,996
<font color="yellow">She has a lot of experience
working with celebrities.</font>

513
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:20,816
<font color="yellow">Where's Ho Jin?</font>

514
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:40,946
<font color="yellow">There he is.</font>

515
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:50,436
<font color="yellow">You seem to be in a good mood. Did
you find money on the street?</font>

516
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:51,616
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

517
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:52,776
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

518
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,576
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Suh Ji An.</font>

519
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,876
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I kept you waiting.</font>

520
00:27:02,846 --> 00:27:04,746
<font color="yellow">Not at all. We just got here.</font>

521
00:27:04,876 --> 00:27:06,046
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

522
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:07,816
<font color="yellow">We can wait all day.</font>

523
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:13,016
<font color="yellow">We want there to be one more room.</font>

524
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:16,252
<font color="yellow">And can you do something about
the noise coming from his room?</font>

525
00:27:16,276 --> 00:27:19,246
<font color="yellow">He goes to bed listening
to his old dance songs.</font>

526
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:22,246
<font color="yellow">I should be the one to talk.
It's so loud every night.</font>

527
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:23,876
<font color="yellow">Just keep that strange noise down.</font>

528
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:25,846
<font color="yellow">We watched together. Remember?</font>

529
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:31,416
<font color="yellow">Also, can you change the
bathroom to a wet-type?</font>

530
00:27:31,876 --> 00:27:34,276
<font color="yellow">This guy floods the bathroom every day.</font>

531
00:27:34,676 --> 00:27:35,816
<font color="yellow">I don't even go that often.</font>

532
00:27:35,976 --> 00:27:38,122
<font color="yellow">You practically live there since
you have sensitive bowels.</font>

533
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,576
<font color="yellow">You have sensitive bowels, too.</font>

534
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:44,452
<font color="yellow">I want the construction to
start as soon as possible.</font>

535
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:46,546
<font color="yellow">- Of course.
- It used to be just us three,</font>

536
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:48,076
<font color="yellow">but that guy is moving in with us.</font>

537
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,616
<font color="yellow">The break-up hasn't been easy on him.</font>

538
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:53,146
<font color="yellow">He needs to be around people
for his mental health.</font>

539
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:57,116
<font color="yellow">I'll have to look around the house first.</font>

540
00:27:57,276 --> 00:28:00,076
<font color="yellow">- When are you available?
- Ho Jin's my manager.</font>

541
00:28:00,216 --> 00:28:01,446
<font color="yellow">You can talk with him.</font>

542
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:05,116
<font color="yellow">- Can you give me your number?
- What?</font>

543
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:12,676
<font color="yellow"><i>(LEE HO JIN)</i></font>

544
00:28:13,146 --> 00:28:14,626
<font color="yellow">Are you on a blind date or something?</font>

545
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,576
<font color="yellow">Why are you making such a fuss?</font>

546
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,506
<font color="yellow">It's Eun Gab. Can you answer it for me?</font>

547
00:28:26,316 --> 00:28:27,316
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

548
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:32,716
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Kim. This is Ho Jin.</font>

549
00:28:32,816 --> 00:28:34,446
<font color="yellow">Why are you answering his phone?</font>

550
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,545
<font color="yellow">Is he avoiding me on purpose?</font>

551
00:28:36,546 --> 00:28:39,116
<font color="yellow">No, he's just busy right now.</font>

552
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:42,516
<font color="yellow">Tell him I'll move into his house
if he continues to be like this.</font>

553
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:44,376
<font color="yellow">CJ is waiting for his answer.</font>

554
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,852
<font color="yellow">What is he going to do about this?</font>

555
00:28:45,876 --> 00:28:48,176
<font color="yellow">I read the script...</font>

556
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:52,075
<font color="yellow">- and I thought it was good.
- I don't care what you think.</font>

557
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:54,076
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to Young Bin about it?</font>

558
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:56,946
<font color="yellow">I did, but he's pretty persistent.</font>

559
00:28:57,076 --> 00:28:59,516
<font color="yellow">- What?
- He doesn't like the tiger role.</font>

560
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,116
<font color="yellow">Just keep telling him that
the script is a masterpiece.</font>

561
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,176
<font color="yellow">Do that for me.</font>

562
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:12,916
<font color="yellow">You and me are on the same side now.</font>

563
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,346
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- So listen to me carefully.</font>

564
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:17,816
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in the men's room?</font>

565
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:19,216
<font color="yellow">I came looking for you.</font>

566
00:29:19,316 --> 00:29:23,146
<font color="yellow">There's a call from Ms. Jo Tae Young.</font>

567
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,646
<font color="yellow">Go and tell her I'm really
busy with a meeting.</font>

568
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,416
<font color="yellow">You could still talk to her over
the phone in the middle of it.</font>

569
00:29:30,516 --> 00:29:33,816
<font color="yellow">Then tell her I got admitted to
the emergency room or something.</font>

570
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:36,046
<font color="yellow">Just make something up. Get out of here.</font>

571
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,646
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

572
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:41,516
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that? The CEO
of Idea is looking for me.</font>

573
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,876
<font color="yellow">Listen up.</font>

574
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:48,146
<font color="yellow">Young Bin has to be in this movie.</font>

575
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,016
<font color="yellow">He has to be. Got it?</font>

576
00:29:53,816 --> 00:29:54,816
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

577
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,916
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim.
- Hold on.</font>

578
00:30:01,746 --> 00:30:03,016
<font color="yellow">Why would she...</font>

579
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:09,516
<font color="yellow">Hey. Where are we on "War Terminator"?</font>

580
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:12,176
<font color="yellow">We're looking into it.</font>

581
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:14,776
<font color="yellow">Why are you still looking into it?</font>

582
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,076
<font color="yellow">I got a call from Ms. Jo Tae Young.</font>

583
00:30:18,176 --> 00:30:19,846
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm getting it now.</font>

584
00:30:25,446 --> 00:30:26,446
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

585
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:28,546
<font color="yellow">Yes, Boss.</font>

586
00:30:28,646 --> 00:30:30,966
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you to tell her
I'm in an important meeting?</font>

587
00:30:31,216 --> 00:30:33,746
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

588
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:37,416
<font color="yellow">I didn't get what you meant, but I
told her you're at the hospital.</font>

589
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:38,776
<font color="yellow">Did I say that to you?</font>

590
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,592
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim, why should you be at the hospital?</font>

591
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,746
<font color="yellow">Forget it, punk.</font>

592
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,046
<font color="yellow">By the way, the big boss is
looking for you, the small boss.</font>

593
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,516
<font color="yellow">Who are you calling the small boss?</font>

594
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:50,816
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

595
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,346
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

596
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:10,576
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

597
00:31:15,646 --> 00:31:16,926
<font color="yellow">Her pose is like a professional.</font>

598
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:19,416
<font color="yellow">Is Young Bin not doing "War Terminator"?</font>

599
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:22,046
<font color="yellow">Where did you hear that from?
You're so good at getting news.</font>

600
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,176
<font color="yellow">You know I'm friends with Tae Young.</font>

601
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,846
<font color="yellow">I talked to her into casting Young Bin.</font>

602
00:31:27,746 --> 00:31:29,592
<font color="yellow">You don't seem to be getting
a simple job done, though.</font>

603
00:31:29,616 --> 00:31:31,476
<font color="yellow">You impotent tool. What are your balls for?</font>

604
00:31:31,616 --> 00:31:33,316
<font color="yellow">That's what you think.</font>

605
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:36,876
<font color="yellow">I made the whole thing possible
working together with CJ.</font>

606
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,496
<font color="yellow">Did you get Alzheimer's already?</font>

607
00:31:41,576 --> 00:31:43,016
<font color="yellow">That's yours. Double serving, right?</font>

608
00:31:43,216 --> 00:31:46,076
<font color="yellow">You always had double servings for lunch.</font>

609
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,276
<font color="yellow">I don't even remember that.</font>

610
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:51,576
<font color="yellow">I'm cutting down on carbohydrates.</font>

611
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,676
<font color="yellow">How's the contract renewal
going with Young Bin?</font>

612
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,276
<font color="yellow">Can you let me handle it?</font>

613
00:31:57,476 --> 00:32:00,016
<font color="yellow">You're the one who put me in
charge and ran off on vacation.</font>

614
00:32:00,116 --> 00:32:03,476
<font color="yellow">Then stop making such a mess.</font>

615
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,896
<font color="yellow">He's going to renew the contract.</font>

616
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:06,946
<font color="yellow">He's going all the way with me.</font>

617
00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:09,076
<font color="yellow">He's a loyal guy.
He can't be bought with money.</font>

618
00:32:09,616 --> 00:32:11,416
<font color="yellow">He's a better man than you think.</font>

619
00:32:12,216 --> 00:32:13,216
<font color="yellow">You don't know that.</font>

620
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,316
<font color="yellow">Keep a close eye on him.</font>

621
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,016
<font color="yellow">Check to see whom he hangs out with.</font>

622
00:32:18,676 --> 00:32:20,346
<font color="yellow">He didn't knock up anyone, did he?</font>

623
00:32:21,076 --> 00:32:24,646
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
No one does that any more.</font>

624
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:26,146
<font color="yellow">This isn't the 80s.</font>

625
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,446
<font color="yellow">I told you.</font>

626
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:31,386
<font color="yellow">You can never trust those who wear masks.</font>

627
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,716
<font color="yellow">Enough with that. I'm leaving.</font>

628
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,215
<font color="yellow">You're going to make me sick.
Old people should just die.</font>

629
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:38,276
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to teach you a lesson again?</font>

630
00:32:38,746 --> 00:32:40,426
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to let you do that any more.</font>

631
00:32:42,816 --> 00:32:45,376
<font color="yellow">That hurts! Why'd you do that?</font>

632
00:32:45,746 --> 00:32:47,816
<font color="yellow">Go do your job.</font>

633
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:51,916
<font color="yellow">You must be under a lot
of stress these days.</font>

634
00:32:52,646 --> 00:32:54,646
<font color="yellow">I know a place where they'll
make you feel better.</font>

635
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,046
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

636
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:58,316
<font color="yellow">She's out of her mind.</font>

637
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,916
<font color="yellow">- Seriously.
- You little punk.</font>

638
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,952
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to avoid Mr.
Kim's calls?</font>

639
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,776
<font color="yellow">Until he stops talking
about that hero movie.</font>

640
00:33:34,476 --> 00:33:36,556
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that. Can you
give it another thought?</font>

641
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,216
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

642
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,416
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim has a point.</font>

643
00:33:41,446 --> 00:33:42,522
<font color="yellow">You're taking his side again.</font>

644
00:33:42,546 --> 00:33:45,476
<font color="yellow">Stop being immature. I'm
not taking anyone's side.</font>

645
00:33:46,046 --> 00:33:48,276
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about that.
I'm not doing it.</font>

646
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,426
<font color="yellow">I'm stubborn, right? Those are your words.</font>

647
00:33:50,816 --> 00:33:53,336
<font color="yellow">Do you guys like this table?
Let's put this in the living room.</font>

648
00:33:53,816 --> 00:33:55,146
<font color="yellow"><i>(3,000 DOLLARS)</i></font>

649
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:56,876
<font color="yellow">No way. This is way too expensive.</font>

650
00:33:56,976 --> 00:33:59,376
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Young Bin can
get a 30-percent discount.</font>

651
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:00,476
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

652
00:34:02,016 --> 00:34:03,746
<font color="yellow">- That's perfect.
- This is unfair.</font>

653
00:34:04,046 --> 00:34:06,376
<font color="yellow">I'm an actor, too. Why
don't I get a discount?</font>

654
00:34:06,816 --> 00:34:08,816
<font color="yellow">Pick anything you like. I'll buy you.</font>

655
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:16,716
<font color="yellow">Isn't this cute? Should
I get this for So Hee?</font>

656
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,486
<font color="yellow">You'll make her feel uncomfortable.
You're not even her boyfriend.</font>

657
00:34:24,446 --> 00:34:26,146
<font color="yellow">You don't let me get a new house.</font>

658
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:29,376
<font color="yellow">You don't let me pick my own movies.
And I can't even buy furniture.</font>

659
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:32,546
<font color="yellow">- I can't buy gifts now.
- That's not what I meant.</font>

660
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,176
<font color="yellow">I can't live like this.</font>

661
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:40,676
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to say that?</font>

662
00:34:40,976 --> 00:34:42,656
<font color="yellow">He said he was going to get it for So Hee.</font>

663
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:48,646
<font color="yellow">Fine, have it your way.</font>

664
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:52,176
<font color="yellow">- Can we buy the table, then?
- Not that.</font>

665
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:55,316
<font color="yellow">- Can I buy you a car, then?
- That's not what I'm talking about.</font>

666
00:34:56,086 --> 00:34:58,746
<font color="yellow">You don't have to do the movie.
I'll find something else.</font>

667
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,476
<font color="yellow">You're finally on my side
and not on Eun Gab's.</font>

668
00:35:02,586 --> 00:35:04,676
<font color="yellow">- What is he saying?
- You're on his side now.</font>

669
00:35:12,746 --> 00:35:14,276
<font color="yellow">The other guy will pay.</font>

670
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,446
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

671
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:19,246
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

672
00:35:20,546 --> 00:35:22,376
<font color="yellow">Long time no see. I work here.</font>

673
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:25,086
<font color="yellow">You work here? What about the theater?</font>

674
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:27,716
<font color="yellow">I quit.</font>

675
00:35:28,476 --> 00:35:30,276
<font color="yellow">- I'm not acting any more.
- Why not?</font>

676
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,706
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to
be the next Song Kang Ho.</font>

677
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:35,476
<font color="yellow">You know how it things are.</font>

678
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:37,086
<font color="yellow">My wife got pregnant.</font>

679
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,346
<font color="yellow">I need to cover the living expenses.</font>

680
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:42,616
<font color="yellow">You can't quit acting like that, though.</font>

681
00:35:42,746 --> 00:35:46,046
<font color="yellow">You have it easy because
of your celebrity cousin.</font>

682
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:48,616
<font color="yellow">You should come to your senses, too.</font>

683
00:35:48,976 --> 00:35:51,416
<font color="yellow">Are you intending on living in
your brother's shadow forever?</font>

684
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,646
<font color="yellow">We're in our 30s now.</font>

685
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:57,346
<font color="yellow">We have to consider quitting as an
option if it's not going to work.</font>

686
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:00,156
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you later.
- See you.</font>

687
00:36:04,516 --> 00:36:07,176
<font color="yellow">- Turn that off.
- Yes, it's so loud.</font>

688
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:09,586
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

689
00:36:10,746 --> 00:36:12,746
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

690
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:14,086
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

691
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:16,416
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

692
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,246
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

693
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:21,846
<font color="yellow">The movie isn't over yet.
Can you clean up later?</font>

694
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,146
<font color="yellow">Joon. I talked to the agency. They'll
call you for auditions soon.</font>

695
00:36:25,246 --> 00:36:26,852
<font color="yellow">I don't know when I'll see Eun Gab again,</font>

696
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:28,446
<font color="yellow">but I'll talk to him.</font>

697
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,216
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much.</font>

698
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:33,746
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, I don't want to
hear that from you today.</font>

699
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:35,276
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone.</font>

700
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:38,416
<font color="yellow">I have things to worry about in solitude.</font>

701
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:41,116
<font color="yellow">Can you take that to your room?</font>

702
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:42,976
<font color="yellow">Stop spilling.</font>

703
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:45,192
<font color="yellow">- Do you not have a jaw?
- What are you doing?</font>

704
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:46,946
<font color="yellow">You're so nasty.</font>

705
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,976
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

706
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,346
<font color="yellow">At least don't make a mess if
you're not going to clean up.</font>

707
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,916
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

708
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,416
<font color="yellow">Why is this traitor calling me?</font>

709
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,176
<font color="yellow">- Who? Mr. Lim?
- Yes.</font>

710
00:37:06,616 --> 00:37:07,676
<font color="yellow">Hello? What's this about?</font>

711
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:10,016
<font color="yellow">Long time no see, Actor Cha.</font>

712
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,646
<font color="yellow">That's because you bailed on
me without saying anything.</font>

713
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:15,516
<font color="yellow">There must be a misunderstanding.
We should talk face to face.</font>

714
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:17,852
<font color="yellow">We're throwing an opening party
for our agency. You should come.</font>

715
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:20,946
<font color="yellow">- Why would I go there?
- I have things to discuss with you.</font>

716
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,716
<font color="yellow">You're not going to stick with
Mr. Kim, are you?</font>

717
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:27,676
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You're our rising star.</font>

718
00:37:28,676 --> 00:37:31,176
<font color="yellow">I couldn't ask you to come
with me because of Young Bin.</font>

719
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:32,696
<font color="yellow">You should definitely come.</font>

720
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:40,876
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lim invited me over to his party.</font>

721
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:45,446
<font color="yellow">I think he's going to ask
me to join his agency.</font>

722
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,346
<font color="yellow">- You're moving agencies?
- I don't know yet.</font>

723
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:50,376
<font color="yellow">It is true that Mr. Kim
doesn't give a darn about me.</font>

724
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,216
<font color="yellow">I think this could be a good
chance to receive special care.</font>

725
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:54,516
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

726
00:37:54,976 --> 00:37:56,046
<font color="yellow">He called me...</font>

727
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,376
<font color="yellow">a rising star.</font>

728
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:02,776
<font color="yellow">You're all going, right?</font>

729
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:04,616
<font color="yellow">Sure. Where is it?</font>

730
00:39:03,316 --> 00:39:05,946
<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was this kind of party.</font>

731
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,022
<font color="yellow">There was a reason why it's
so far away from the city.</font>

732
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,346
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lim always gets crazy about clubbing.</font>

733
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,216
<font color="yellow">Joon, this agency has bright future ahead.
You should join right away.</font>

734
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:14,616
<font color="yellow">Are you here?</font>

735
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:16,546
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.</font>

736
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:18,816
<font color="yellow">- The traffic was so heavy.
- Hello, Young Bin.</font>

737
00:39:19,446 --> 00:39:21,176
<font color="yellow">It must've been a long trip. Come this way.</font>

738
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:26,016
<font color="yellow">What's going on? Did he call
you over to see Young Bin?</font>

739
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:27,616
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

740
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:34,086
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

741
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:36,946
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

742
00:39:37,616 --> 00:39:38,976
<font color="yellow">It's so crowded in here. Let's go.</font>

743
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:43,678
<font color="yellow">This party is sponsored by Maxim.</font>

744
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:47,318
<font color="yellow">Everyone related to the agency is
here, including my acquaintances.</font>

745
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:49,678
<font color="yellow">We also have Ms. Maxims with us.</font>

746
00:39:49,908 --> 00:39:51,178
<font color="yellow">This is a real party, isn't it?</font>

747
00:39:51,278 --> 00:39:54,408
<font color="yellow">Yes, but don't you have
something to discuss with Joon?</font>

748
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:57,978
<font color="yellow">Of course. I don't even
know where to start.</font>

749
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:00,108
<font color="yellow">The thing is...</font>

750
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:02,608
<font color="yellow">I want to talk to you first.</font>

751
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,318
<font color="yellow">How are things with Mr.
Kim Eun Gab these days?</font>

752
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:07,608
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

753
00:40:08,078 --> 00:40:09,908
<font color="yellow">Don't you get frustrated by him?</font>

754
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:12,408
<font color="yellow">He's so stubborn and self-centered.</font>

755
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,278
<font color="yellow">Frankly speaking, other actors left
him because they share my opinion.</font>

756
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:18,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, he can be like that.</font>

757
00:40:18,818 --> 00:40:20,354
<font color="yellow">What about you, Ho Jin? Aren't you tired?</font>

758
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,608
<font color="yellow">- He must roll all over you.
- Not really. I'm fine.</font>

759
00:40:22,778 --> 00:40:23,948
<font color="yellow">He did that to me, too.</font>

760
00:40:24,278 --> 00:40:25,918
<font color="yellow">He talked down to me and called me names.</font>

761
00:40:25,978 --> 00:40:29,478
<font color="yellow">He used to call me Ms. Lim when
he got me to bring coffee.</font>

762
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:30,978
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

763
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:34,848
<font color="yellow">He's still a capable man.</font>

764
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:38,078
<font color="yellow">"Capable"? He didn't do anything.</font>

765
00:40:38,148 --> 00:40:39,824
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang Ok Ja is the one
who did all the work.</font>

766
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:41,948
<font color="yellow">The way he gets things
done is too old-fashioned.</font>

767
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,178
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,</font>

768
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:45,348
<font color="yellow">isn't your contract expiring soon?</font>

769
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,848
<font color="yellow">I got heavily invested this time.</font>

770
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,678
<font color="yellow">We're having talks with famous
celebrities at the moment.</font>

771
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:55,178
<font color="yellow">If you'd like to know, I consider
my actors' opinions most important.</font>

772
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,148
<font color="yellow">I won't force you to do a movie
that you don't want to be in.</font>

773
00:40:58,848 --> 00:40:59,908
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

774
00:41:01,578 --> 00:41:02,578
<font color="yellow">But you know what?</font>

775
00:41:03,778 --> 00:41:05,648
<font color="yellow">I don't like talking behind someone's back.</font>

776
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,178
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

777
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:10,108
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on starting
a new agency, Mr. Lim.</font>

778
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:16,708
<font color="yellow">Sure. We'll talk more later.</font>

779
00:41:39,048 --> 00:41:41,548
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Aren't you a
member of Sugar Boys?</font>

780
00:41:42,148 --> 00:41:44,348
<font color="yellow">How do you know that?</font>

781
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:46,408
<font color="yellow">I was a huge fan.</font>

782
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:47,908
<font color="yellow">You're Cha Joon, right?</font>

783
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:50,548
<font color="yellow">Can I take a picture with you?</font>

784
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:52,548
<font color="yellow">I'll have to ask my manager first.</font>

785
00:41:53,508 --> 00:41:54,578
<font color="yellow">He said yes.</font>

786
00:41:58,278 --> 00:42:01,548
<font color="yellow">- Well then.
- Say cheese.</font>

787
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,448
<font color="yellow">How does it look?</font>

788
00:42:05,978 --> 00:42:07,538
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing here?
- Thank you.</font>

789
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,478
<font color="yellow">Did you just take a picture with Ms.
Maxims?</font>

790
00:42:13,548 --> 00:42:16,447
<font color="yellow">It's amazing that there are
fans who still remember you.</font>

791
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:17,648
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Wait.</font>

792
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:20,678
<font color="yellow">- You staged this, didn't you?
- What?</font>

793
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:22,848
<font color="yellow">You got her to say that to me.</font>

794
00:42:23,278 --> 00:42:24,378
<font color="yellow">I can read you like a book.</font>

795
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:27,578
<font color="yellow">You're so fast when it comes to
things like this. You're amazing.</font>

796
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:31,578
<font color="yellow">I just wanted you to feel better.</font>

797
00:42:31,778 --> 00:42:33,348
<font color="yellow">He's right. I asked them, too.</font>

798
00:42:33,408 --> 00:42:35,108
<font color="yellow">Whatever. You completely ruined my mood.</font>

799
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:37,208
<font color="yellow">That's enough now. Don't get too drunk.</font>

800
00:42:37,478 --> 00:42:39,124
<font color="yellow">- Let's go home, Joon.
- I don't think so.</font>

801
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,948
<font color="yellow">Not until we finish all these drinks.</font>

802
00:42:41,448 --> 00:42:42,478
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lim...</font>

803
00:42:43,508 --> 00:42:45,268
<font color="yellow">called me over here to
sweet-talk Young Bin.</font>

804
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:48,108
<font color="yellow">I'm so pathetic.</font>

805
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,578
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.</font>

806
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:54,048
<font color="yellow">I might just pee in the pool.</font>

807
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:57,448
<font color="yellow">- Is he really going to do it?
- I think he already did.</font>

808
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,378
<font color="yellow">Joon. Did you really do it?</font>

809
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,008
<font color="yellow">There you are.</font>

810
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:09,978
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, I want you to meet someone.
Let's go.</font>

811
00:43:11,308 --> 00:43:12,348
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

812
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:16,978
<font color="yellow">What is going on?</font>

813
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:38,948
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

814
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:40,608
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

815
00:43:41,008 --> 00:43:42,008
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

816
00:43:42,608 --> 00:43:44,478
<font color="yellow">- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.</font>

817
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:46,808
<font color="yellow">Clara says she's a big fan of you.</font>

818
00:43:46,948 --> 00:43:48,848
<font color="yellow">That's right. I'm a huge fan.</font>

819
00:43:49,448 --> 00:43:50,954
<font color="yellow">You were so good in "The Flowers of Evil".</font>

820
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:53,248
<font color="yellow">- I'm a big fan of you, Clara.
- Thank you.</font>

821
00:43:53,378 --> 00:43:55,248
<font color="yellow">We're currently negotiating
terms with Clara.</font>

822
00:43:56,108 --> 00:43:57,348
<font color="yellow">You two should talk.</font>

823
00:44:00,978 --> 00:44:02,748
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm sorry.</font>

824
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,178
<font color="yellow">My hair is wet from the pool.</font>

825
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:06,608
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

826
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,378
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but could you
pass me my clothes?</font>

827
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:11,408
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

828
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:18,948
<font color="yellow">What a gentleman.</font>

829
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:21,808
<font color="yellow">Take a seat.</font>

830
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:34,878
<font color="yellow">It's really chaotic outside, right?</font>

831
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:37,008
<font color="yellow">A little bit.</font>

832
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:44,008
<font color="yellow">What are you doing after the party?</font>

833
00:44:45,878 --> 00:44:46,878
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

834
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:03,448
<font color="yellow">Hold your dad's hand.</font>

835
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:06,408
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

836
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,448
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

837
00:45:11,748 --> 00:45:12,748
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

838
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:14,808
<font color="yellow">That jerk...</font>

839
00:45:16,408 --> 00:45:18,408
<font color="yellow">I knew that would happen.
Where are you right now?</font>

840
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:21,008
<font color="yellow">Turn it off right now.</font>

841
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:22,607
<font color="yellow">The pastor is waiting.</font>

842
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:25,348
<font color="yellow">This is more urgent than
having North Korea invade us.</font>

843
00:45:25,448 --> 00:45:26,948
<font color="yellow">You missed it last week, too.</font>

844
00:45:27,108 --> 00:45:29,578
<font color="yellow">I told you to turn it off
for service, didn't I?</font>

845
00:45:29,678 --> 00:45:33,608
<font color="yellow">I know, but a snake is
trying to seduce Young Bin.</font>

846
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,024
<font color="yellow">Is this about Cha Young Bin again?</font>

847
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:37,528
<font color="yellow">If you miss service like this,
you'll be punished after death.</font>

848
00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:40,877
<font color="yellow">Why would I be punished? Do you
know how much offering I handed in?</font>

849
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:42,847
<font color="yellow">It's enough to build a few churches.</font>

850
00:45:42,848 --> 00:45:44,308
<font color="yellow">I really have to leave right now.</font>

851
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,578
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- He's seeing Clara.</font>

852
00:45:45,678 --> 00:45:48,348
<font color="yellow">Some actors change their
agency because of women.</font>

853
00:45:48,408 --> 00:45:50,154
<font color="yellow">If Young Bin leaves me, are you
going to take responsibility?</font>

854
00:45:50,178 --> 00:45:51,778
<font color="yellow">You won't, right? Please.</font>

855
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:54,678
<font color="yellow">I'm coming right now. Yes,
I know where that is.</font>

856
00:45:54,808 --> 00:45:55,848
<font color="yellow">I love you, Honey.</font>

857
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,408
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

858
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,348
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

859
00:46:09,878 --> 00:46:12,578
<font color="yellow">I know the CEO here.</font>

860
00:46:13,678 --> 00:46:15,248
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

861
00:46:16,408 --> 00:46:18,678
<font color="yellow">I designed the interior for the agency.</font>

862
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:19,778
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

863
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,278
<font color="yellow">Are you here alone? What
about your friends?</font>

864
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:25,848
<font color="yellow">They're all here, but we separated.</font>

865
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:27,948
<font color="yellow">Are they inside?</font>

866
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:31,478
<font color="yellow">- Are you a loner?
- Pardon?</font>

867
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:34,948
<font color="yellow">I'm just kidding. You
guys look really tight.</font>

868
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:36,048
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

869
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:41,008
<font color="yellow">- Will you go inside with me?
- Pardon?</font>

870
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:43,208
<font color="yellow">I didn't know the party would be like this.</font>

871
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:44,908
<font color="yellow">I'm glad I ran into someone I know.</font>

872
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:48,208
<font color="yellow">We don't really know each other, though.</font>

873
00:46:48,278 --> 00:46:49,958
<font color="yellow">- You don't want to go in with me?
- I do.</font>

874
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,578
<font color="yellow">It's our second time. Come on.</font>

875
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:14,208
<font color="yellow">What's going on with Ho Jin?</font>

876
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:17,508
<font color="yellow">He's getting better.</font>

877
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:18,908
<font color="yellow">You need to step up your game.</font>

878
00:47:19,348 --> 00:47:20,508
<font color="yellow">More like getting stiff.</font>

879
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:23,548
<font color="yellow">Are you getting stiff?</font>

880
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,408
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

881
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:37,648
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

882
00:47:38,178 --> 00:47:39,248
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

883
00:47:39,348 --> 00:47:41,647
<font color="yellow">I know the CEO as well.</font>

884
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:42,648
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

885
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,648
<font color="yellow">I know some people over there.
I better get going.</font>

886
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:50,178
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Why?</font>

887
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,508
<font color="yellow">- We need to talk about business.
- Right.</font>

888
00:47:54,908 --> 00:47:57,148
<font color="yellow">- See you later.
- Goodbye.</font>

889
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,208
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

890
00:48:00,048 --> 00:48:02,208
<font color="yellow">- Have you been well?
- Yes.</font>

891
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:05,148
<font color="yellow">- Why are you two together?
- I ran into her here.</font>

892
00:48:05,278 --> 00:48:06,278
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

893
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:09,508
<font color="yellow">- Are you sad she left?
- Yes. No. What?</font>

894
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:12,678
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

895
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:16,708
<font color="yellow">I'm suffering under the weight of life...</font>

896
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:19,878
<font color="yellow">while Young Bin...</font>

897
00:48:20,408 --> 00:48:22,208
<font color="yellow">went to meet Clara...</font>

898
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:24,308
<font color="yellow">and Turtle...</font>

899
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:26,148
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

900
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,708
<font color="yellow">I trusted you,</font>

901
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,978
<font color="yellow">but you were flirting with the designer.</font>

902
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:34,508
<font color="yellow">It's not like that.</font>

903
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:35,808
<font color="yellow">Don't bother.</font>

904
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:39,878
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

905
00:48:40,608 --> 00:48:41,608
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

906
00:48:42,948 --> 00:48:44,408
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

907
00:48:46,078 --> 00:48:47,078
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

908
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:50,248
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

909
00:48:52,608 --> 00:48:54,278
<font color="yellow">Joon, look.</font>

910
00:48:54,508 --> 00:48:55,648
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

911
00:48:58,248 --> 00:48:59,778
<font color="yellow">You can cool down a little.</font>

912
00:49:00,778 --> 00:49:01,778
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

913
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,078
<font color="yellow">I fell in.</font>

914
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:05,948
<font color="yellow">You're too old for this.</font>

915
00:49:14,008 --> 00:49:15,008
<font color="yellow">The pool looks cool.</font>

916
00:49:42,848 --> 00:49:43,848
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

917
00:49:50,978 --> 00:49:51,978
<font color="yellow">Jerk.</font>

918
00:49:54,108 --> 00:49:55,578
<font color="yellow">I came to retrieve what's mine.</font>

919
00:49:56,878 --> 00:49:59,308
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean?
- Don't try to fool me around.</font>

920
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:02,478
<font color="yellow">You used to have a habit
of stealing things.</font>

921
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:04,508
<font color="yellow">Old habits die hard, I guess.</font>

922
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:07,308
<font color="yellow">You got massages with
the company's money...</font>

923
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,248
<font color="yellow">and stole presents from fans back then.</font>

924
00:50:10,348 --> 00:50:11,548
<font color="yellow">Let's talk outside.</font>

925
00:50:12,578 --> 00:50:14,208
<font color="yellow">- Don't mind me.
- Let me go.</font>

926
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:18,978
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

927
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:21,978
<font color="yellow">Don't make up lies.</font>

928
00:50:22,408 --> 00:50:24,108
<font color="yellow">I'm not a manager any more.</font>

929
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:26,748
<font color="yellow">I'm a CEO, too.</font>

930
00:50:26,978 --> 00:50:28,048
<font color="yellow">CEO?</font>

931
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:31,748
<font color="yellow">The person who invested in your company...</font>

932
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:33,548
<font color="yellow">goes to my church.</font>

933
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:36,478
<font color="yellow">"The person you're investing in..."</font>

934
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,808
<font color="yellow">"is using your precious money
to get himself a car,"</font>

935
00:50:38,848 --> 00:50:40,508
<font color="yellow">"to go to bars and to buy girls."</font>

936
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:43,008
<font color="yellow">"He also makes new
actresses go around bars."</font>

937
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:45,308
<font color="yellow">Should I tell him what a jerk you are?</font>

938
00:50:45,408 --> 00:50:46,908
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim... Well...</font>

939
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:49,208
<font color="yellow">I know you stole actors from my agency.</font>

940
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:51,408
<font color="yellow">And now, you're trying to
steal Young Bin as well.</font>

941
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:53,748
<font color="yellow">You have no conscience whatsoever.</font>

942
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:56,578
<font color="yellow">If I see you try to pull a trick again,</font>

943
00:50:56,848 --> 00:50:59,648
<font color="yellow">I'll crush your puny company.</font>

944
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:01,378
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

945
00:51:02,048 --> 00:51:03,348
<font color="yellow">Over there, Sir.</font>

946
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:09,578
<font color="yellow">Do your wife and daughter know
that you have fun like this?</font>

947
00:51:10,148 --> 00:51:11,478
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

948
00:51:16,648 --> 00:51:18,648
<font color="yellow">Is this how you're going to back stab me?</font>

949
00:51:19,878 --> 00:51:21,548
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

950
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:23,648
<font color="yellow">You've been ignoring my calls.</font>

951
00:51:23,808 --> 00:51:26,608
<font color="yellow">And you're at another
company's opening party.</font>

952
00:51:27,778 --> 00:51:29,248
<font color="yellow">We're just here to party.</font>

953
00:51:30,248 --> 00:51:31,608
<font color="yellow">What will other people think?</font>

954
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:36,678
<font color="yellow">And should you really be hanging
out with these cheap people?</font>

955
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:39,278
<font color="yellow">- Cup Noodles.
- Yes?</font>

956
00:51:39,478 --> 00:51:41,278
<font color="yellow">- You and I will talk later.
- Okay.</font>

957
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:42,848
<font color="yellow">You, too.</font>

958
00:51:44,778 --> 00:51:46,848
<font color="yellow">All right. What do you have against me?</font>

959
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,608
<font color="yellow">Just tell me. Let it out.</font>

960
00:51:48,848 --> 00:51:51,254
<font color="yellow">- I don't have anything.
- Why are you not answering me then?</font>

961
00:51:51,278 --> 00:51:52,348
<font color="yellow">Also, why are you here?</font>

962
00:51:52,448 --> 00:51:54,548
<font color="yellow">Because you keep on talking
about "War Terminator".</font>

963
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:56,478
<font color="yellow">Do you think I want to ruin you?</font>

964
00:51:57,078 --> 00:51:58,558
<font color="yellow">Did I ever make you do something bad?</font>

965
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:00,978
<font color="yellow">I'm doing all this for you.</font>

966
00:52:01,478 --> 00:52:03,348
<font color="yellow">Please listen to me this time.</font>

967
00:52:04,178 --> 00:52:06,408
<font color="yellow">Talk to him. You liked the script, too.</font>

968
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:07,847
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was good...</font>

969
00:52:07,848 --> 00:52:09,448
<font color="yellow">I already told him I won't do it.</font>

970
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:13,778
<font color="yellow">- You won't reconsider?
- No.</font>

971
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:15,608
<font color="yellow">You should give up, too.</font>

972
00:52:17,278 --> 00:52:19,878
<font color="yellow">I remember when you first
came to my office.</font>

973
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:24,778
<font color="yellow">I thought you were a handsome
kid with an empty head.</font>

974
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:26,778
<font color="yellow">However, you had a way with your speech.</font>

975
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,607
<font color="yellow">You had your own ethics and were stubborn.</font>

976
00:52:28,608 --> 00:52:30,784
<font color="yellow">After working with you,
I realized you were loyal, too.</font>

977
00:52:30,808 --> 00:52:33,508
<font color="yellow">I thought, "this guy is the real deal."</font>

978
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,708
<font color="yellow">I've put a lot in you.</font>

979
00:52:40,778 --> 00:52:41,808
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

980
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,328
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed in you for the first time.</font>

981
00:52:44,778 --> 00:52:47,208
<font color="yellow">I mean it. I'm really disappointed.</font>

982
00:52:47,448 --> 00:52:49,278
<font color="yellow">- Please don't be like that.
- Forget it.</font>

983
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:51,908
<font color="yellow">I'm giving up on you as well.</font>

984
00:52:52,648 --> 00:52:54,548
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want,</font>

985
00:52:55,878 --> 00:52:57,378
<font color="yellow">but if you won't do "War Terminator,"</font>

986
00:52:58,848 --> 00:52:59,948
<font color="yellow">it's over between us.</font>

987
00:53:00,248 --> 00:53:01,578
<font color="yellow">If you must have it your way,</font>

988
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:05,048
<font color="yellow">I can't work with you.</font>

989
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:21,708
<font color="yellow">Kim Eun Gab, you jerk.</font>

990
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:26,448
<font color="yellow">Women... I love women.</font>

991
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:29,478
<font color="yellow">I've never seen Eun Gab
so mad like this time.</font>

992
00:53:29,608 --> 00:53:32,248
<font color="yellow">He's usually like that to me, not you.</font>

993
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:34,948
<font color="yellow">I think he's really mad this time.</font>

994
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,608
<font color="yellow">You should have taken his calls.</font>

995
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,528
<font color="yellow">It's not a surprise he misunderstood.</font>

996
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,348
<font color="yellow">Do we have the script for
"War Terminator" at home?</font>

997
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:45,178
<font color="yellow">Are you going to read it?</font>

998
00:53:45,248 --> 00:53:47,648
<font color="yellow">Yes. I feel bad. I should at least read it.</font>

999
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:50,978
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you? You never
do when you don't feel like it.</font>

1000
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:52,808
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear Eun Gab?</font>

1001
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:54,408
<font color="yellow">He says I'm loyal.</font>

1002
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:56,848
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're not scared?</font>

1003
00:53:58,808 --> 00:53:59,808
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

1004
00:53:59,848 --> 00:54:01,348
<font color="yellow"><i>(SO HEE)</i></font>

1005
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,108
<font color="yellow">Yes, So Hee.</font>

1006
00:54:06,648 --> 00:54:08,148
<font color="yellow">I was going to call you.</font>

1007
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:09,784
<font color="yellow">Where do you want to meet tomorrow?</font>

1008
00:54:09,808 --> 00:54:14,108
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Something came up.
I can't see you tomorrow.</font>

1009
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:15,508
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1010
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:18,248
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

1011
00:54:18,348 --> 00:54:21,248
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I really wanted to
hang out with you guys.</font>

1012
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:24,148
<font color="yellow">Tell everyone I said sorry.</font>

1013
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,548
<font color="yellow">It's loud in the back.</font>

1014
00:54:26,078 --> 00:54:28,708
<font color="yellow">- Are you still filming?
- Yes, we're filming outside.</font>

1015
00:54:29,248 --> 00:54:31,578
<font color="yellow">- It's another overnight shoot.
- Really?</font>

1016
00:54:34,878 --> 00:54:36,108
<font color="yellow">Where are you right now?</font>

1017
00:54:39,248 --> 00:54:40,248
<font color="yellow">Cut.</font>

1018
00:54:41,608 --> 00:54:43,078
<font color="yellow">Okay. Next scene.</font>

1019
00:54:48,048 --> 00:54:49,307
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
- Good job.</font>

1020
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:50,678
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
- Great work today.</font>

1021
00:54:51,578 --> 00:54:53,508
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
- Good job.</font>

1022
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:55,407
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Good job.</font>

1023
00:54:55,408 --> 00:54:56,408
<font color="yellow">Good work.</font>

1024
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:06,608
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

1025
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,848
<font color="yellow">- Did I surprise you?
- Hey.</font>

1026
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:16,078
<font color="yellow">How did you get here?</font>

1027
00:55:16,348 --> 00:55:17,708
<font color="yellow">I dropped by while passing.</font>

1028
00:55:18,878 --> 00:55:20,378
<font color="yellow">Why did you surprise me?</font>

1029
00:55:20,478 --> 00:55:22,578
<font color="yellow">I came to see you since
you can't meet tomorrow.</font>

1030
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:23,778
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

1031
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:27,278
<font color="yellow">- Are you finished?
- No, we're far from being done.</font>

1032
00:55:31,608 --> 00:55:32,708
<font color="yellow">- So Hee.
- Yes?</font>

1033
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:37,178
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

1034
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:38,708
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

1035
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:44,348
<font color="yellow">Isn't it cute? I bought it at a shop.</font>

1036
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,048
<font color="yellow">Hey...</font>

1037
00:55:47,208 --> 00:55:48,248
<font color="yellow">Now, I feel bad.</font>

1038
00:55:48,748 --> 00:55:50,678
<font color="yellow">I wish we could grab
something to eat together.</font>

1039
00:55:51,908 --> 00:55:53,308
<font color="yellow">I won't finish until early morning.</font>

1040
00:55:53,948 --> 00:55:55,408
<font color="yellow">They gave the script to us so late.</font>

1041
00:55:56,448 --> 00:55:59,378
<font color="yellow">- I look tired, right?
- No. You look pretty.</font>

1042
00:56:00,978 --> 00:56:03,278
<font color="yellow">You must know my weak spot.</font>

1043
00:56:03,608 --> 00:56:05,648
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll treat you to dinner next time.</font>

1044
00:56:08,808 --> 00:56:10,568
<font color="yellow">Let's meet up often when
your drama is over.</font>

1045
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:12,678
<font color="yellow">You'll take a break, right?</font>

1046
00:56:12,808 --> 00:56:15,148
<font color="yellow">No. I'll start shooting a movie.</font>

1047
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:17,978
<font color="yellow">I don't get a break.</font>

1048
00:56:18,748 --> 00:56:19,778
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1049
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:21,648
<font color="yellow">Which film is it?</font>

1050
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:34,778
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

1051
00:56:35,148 --> 00:56:36,808
<font color="yellow">- Did you make enough for me?
- Yes.</font>

1052
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:40,448
<font color="yellow">I made enough. Come and eat it.</font>

1053
00:56:40,978 --> 00:56:42,948
<font color="yellow">I told you not to make him anything.</font>

1054
00:56:50,578 --> 00:56:51,648
<font color="yellow">It looks good.</font>

1055
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:54,848
<font color="yellow">Did you meet her?</font>

1056
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:56,548
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1057
00:57:00,778 --> 00:57:01,778
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1058
00:57:02,978 --> 00:57:04,748
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened, right?</font>

1059
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:07,447
<font color="yellow">No, I just gave her a present.</font>

1060
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:09,278
<font color="yellow">I got nervous thinking you might...</font>

1061
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:11,478
<font color="yellow">come onto her again and get dumped.</font>

1062
00:57:12,078 --> 00:57:13,178
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

1063
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,348
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's hot.</font>

1064
00:57:19,908 --> 00:57:21,048
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

1065
00:57:21,408 --> 00:57:22,508
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

1066
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:24,584
<font color="yellow">You should have just cooked
the whole bag for me.</font>

1067
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:26,448
<font color="yellow">No, an actor should take care of his body.</font>

1068
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:28,308
<font color="yellow">Your face will swell tomorrow.</font>

1069
00:57:29,048 --> 00:57:30,508
<font color="yellow">- What about you?
- Who cares?</font>

1070
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,978
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to be an actor,
so why should I bother?</font>

1071
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,078
<font color="yellow">- You didn't go home yet.
- No, I waited for you.</font>

1072
00:57:43,708 --> 00:57:45,778
<font color="yellow">- Good. I have to talk to you.
- What is it?</font>

1073
00:57:45,908 --> 00:57:46,978
<font color="yellow">I'll do "War Terminator".</font>

1074
00:57:49,708 --> 00:57:50,708
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1075
00:57:50,978 --> 00:57:53,098
<font color="yellow">- You didn't read it yet.
- Is it because of Mr. Kim?</font>

1076
00:57:54,548 --> 00:57:55,548
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

1077
00:57:58,878 --> 00:57:59,878
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

1078
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,278
<font color="yellow">So Hee might star in "War Terminator".</font>

1079
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,878
<font color="yellow">- What?
- No way.</font>

1080
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:09,678
<font color="yellow">Tell him tomorrow that I'll do it.</font>

1081
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:12,798
<font color="yellow">Let's tell him I'm doing it for him.
It'll make him happy.</font>

1082
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,708
<font color="yellow">You sprayed all over me. How disgusting.</font>

1083
00:58:20,708 --> 00:58:22,748
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you can't stop it?</font>

1084
00:58:23,408 --> 00:58:24,648
<font color="yellow">You're not new in the industry.</font>

1085
00:58:25,278 --> 00:58:28,348
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up, I'll... I have to go.</font>

1086
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:31,578
<font color="yellow">You're here. You're here. Yes.</font>

1087
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,148
<font color="yellow">I want to give you a kiss.</font>

1088
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:35,708
<font color="yellow">Sit down. Sit down.</font>

1089
00:58:36,678 --> 00:58:37,958
<font color="yellow">I heard something good happened.</font>

1090
00:58:38,108 --> 00:58:41,978
<font color="yellow">If you hear this, you'll want to kiss me.</font>

1091
00:58:42,078 --> 00:58:43,438
<font color="yellow">- Make a guess, Cup Noodles.
- Me?</font>

1092
00:58:45,808 --> 00:58:46,847
<font color="yellow">Is he getting a bigger guarantee?</font>

1093
00:58:46,848 --> 00:58:48,978
<font color="yellow">Guarantee? You were meant to be a manager.</font>

1094
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:50,448
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you studied film?</font>

1095
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:52,978
<font color="yellow">Listen.</font>

1096
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:56,078
<font color="yellow">The director of "War Terminator"...</font>

1097
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:03,748
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

1098
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:06,548
<font color="yellow">- Director Lee Joon Ik.
- Hey.</font>

1099
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,208
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

1100
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:12,448
<font color="yellow">He hasn't signed yet, so
this is under embargo.</font>

1101
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,078
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is great.</font>

1102
00:59:14,478 --> 00:59:16,808
<font color="yellow">- You watched all of his films.
- He did.</font>

1103
00:59:16,948 --> 00:59:18,848
<font color="yellow">He's one of the best directors in Korea.</font>

1104
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:20,978
<font color="yellow">- Great.
- Sit down.</font>

1105
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,648
<font color="yellow">You can order all you want today.</font>

1106
00:59:23,808 --> 00:59:26,308
<font color="yellow">- I'll buy. Do you want wine?
- Can we?</font>

1107
00:59:27,478 --> 00:59:28,718
<font color="yellow">Don't you care your appearance?</font>

1108
00:59:28,978 --> 00:59:30,848
<font color="yellow">You look worse every time I see you.</font>

1109
00:59:31,848 --> 00:59:34,848
<font color="yellow">What's the point? It's not like I'll...</font>

1110
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:37,207
<font color="yellow">Someone will call you from the office.
Your manager changed.</font>

1111
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,968
<font color="yellow">They have at least three
auditions lined up.</font>

1112
00:59:39,248 --> 00:59:41,308
<font color="yellow">- What?
- That's great news.</font>

1113
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,808
<font color="yellow">They're just auditions for now.</font>

1114
00:59:46,308 --> 00:59:47,378
<font color="yellow">Why is he so happy?</font>

1115
00:59:48,148 --> 00:59:49,208
<font color="yellow">You should be thankful.</font>

1116
00:59:49,308 --> 00:59:51,278
<font color="yellow">I'll wear my lucky
underwear, so don't worry.</font>

1117
00:59:51,948 --> 00:59:53,008
<font color="yellow">You're an abhorrence.</font>

1118
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,854
<font color="yellow">- He doesn't know what it means.
- What is it?</font>

1119
00:59:55,878 --> 00:59:58,878
<font color="yellow">- Fool.
- What should we eat?</font>

1120
01:00:00,408 --> 01:00:03,778
<font color="yellow">Once the director signs
on, let's have a meeting.</font>

1121
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,208
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

1122
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:07,078
<font color="yellow">Is there an actress you want to work with?</font>

1123
01:00:07,378 --> 01:00:09,378
<font color="yellow">- I'll tell them.
- Not really.</font>

1124
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:11,348
<font color="yellow">I prefer someone who acts well.</font>

1125
01:00:13,408 --> 01:00:14,678
<font color="yellow">What's taking the car so long?</font>

1126
01:00:18,378 --> 01:00:19,408
<font color="yellow">Isn't that...</font>

1127
01:00:19,978 --> 01:00:21,078
<font color="yellow">Who is that guy?</font>

1128
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:24,608
<font color="yellow">An So Hee and Kang Ha Neul are dating.</font>

1129
01:00:25,808 --> 01:00:26,808
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1130
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:30,008
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>
