00:00:22,975 --> 00:00:24,775
<font color="yellow">- Turtle. - How are you so good at this?</font>

4
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,145
<font color="yellow">Have you been practicing?</font>

5
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:28,445
<font color="yellow">This is fun.</font>

6
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:30,275
<font color="yellow">About Eun Gab...</font>

7
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:32,975
<font color="yellow">He probably gave me "Lim Hwa Su"...</font>

8
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:35,545
<font color="yellow">just because I really wanted to do it, right?</font>

9
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,775
<font color="yellow">Probably. Why?</font>

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:39,405
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

11
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,575
<font color="yellow">I really want to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,345
<font color="yellow">It'd be really nice if you got to do it.</font>

13
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:47,805
<font color="yellow">You really should. How else are we going to pay for the breach?</font>

14
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,975
<font color="yellow">I'll be broke if this hiatus goes on for longer.</font>

15
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,505
<font color="yellow">This is nice and relaxing, though.</font>

16
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,275
<font color="yellow">I make money now.</font>

17
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:56,945
<font color="yellow">I finally made a breakthrough. You can count on me.</font>

18
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,445
<font color="yellow">- Don't get ahead of yourself. - Nice.</font>

19
00:00:59,245 --> 00:01:02,105
<font color="yellow">Look at him all excited when our family is about to go broke.</font>

20
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:05,545
<font color="yellow">I wonder if I'll ever see him make money before I retire.</font>

21
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,505
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can't. I'm just not feeling like it.</font>

22
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,145
<font color="yellow">Then start working.</font>

23
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:13,745
<font color="yellow">I will, but you'll be bored to death without me.</font>

24
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,575
<font color="yellow">It's really fine with me. You can work all you want.</font>

25
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:19,375
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You aren't capable of anything other than playing games.</font>

26
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:20,805
<font color="yellow">You said you're looking for a manager, right?</font>

27
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:23,075
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have shootings every week, but I don't have a manager.</font>

28
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,505
<font color="yellow">- What about him? - Him?</font>

29
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,775
<font color="yellow">- Come on. - Me?</font>

30
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,175
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about being a manager, anyway?</font>

31
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:33,845
<font color="yellow">It's a very demanding job.</font>

32
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:37,205
<font color="yellow">All you do is nag and complain.</font>

33
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:38,705
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

34
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,275
<font color="yellow">You should work for Joon if you think it's so easy.</font>

35
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,305
<font color="yellow">- I will. - No way. I won't allow it.</font>

36
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:47,075
<font color="yellow">Why not? You should work together. You guys always tag along anyway.</font>

37
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,775
<font color="yellow">I just need to stay by his side, right?</font>

38
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,745
<font color="yellow">We'll eat, sleep, and poop together.</font>

39
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:56,975
<font color="yellow">You have to work hard.</font>

40
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:58,545
<font color="yellow">It's settled, then.</font>

41
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,045
<font color="yellow">We should talk to Ms. Kang about "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

42
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:03,505
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

43
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:12,805
<font color="yellow">So you're telling me...</font>

44
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,045
<font color="yellow">that you want to be part of "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

45
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:20,445
<font color="yellow">Yes. The talks broke down once, but I really liked the scripts.</font>

46
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,475
<font color="yellow">How do you like the rice cake? It's from a place I know.</font>

47
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,545
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

48
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,905
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

49
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:34,675
<font color="yellow">I need to get "Gab" out of "Ok and Gab" as soon as possible.</font>

50
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:37,775
<font color="yellow">How does "Ok Entertainment" sound, Manager Lee?</font>

51
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:41,275
<font color="yellow">I think it's good.</font>

52
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,645
<font color="yellow">- You won't be able to do the film. - What?</font>

53
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,345
<font color="yellow">What? Why?</font>

54
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,245
<font color="yellow">We haven't looked into the details just yet.</font>

55
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:54,705
<font color="yellow">Is it going to be that difficult?</font>

56
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:56,705
<font color="yellow">The talks had broken down once. It's going to be difficult.</font>

57
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,345
<font color="yellow">There's no director or any investors.</font>

58
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,405
<font color="yellow">There's no way of knowing when you'll get to do it.</font>

59
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:05,505
<font color="yellow">It could take years.</font>

60
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,945
<font color="yellow">Let's do a Chinese drama.</font>

61
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,205
<font color="yellow">Chinese drama?</font>

62
00:03:16,845 --> 00:03:19,405
<font color="yellow">The show has been scheduled already for early next year.</font>

63
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,805
<font color="yellow">It's already been written.</font>

64
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:22,505
<font color="yellow">What genre is it?</font>

65
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:24,405
<font color="yellow">It's a romance.</font>

66
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,875
<font color="yellow">I don't really want to do romance.</font>

67
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:29,575
<font color="yellow">And I'd prefer to do movies over dramas.</font>

68
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:31,845
<font color="yellow">You'll get paid 100,000 dollars per episode.</font>

69
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:33,945
<font color="yellow">40 episodes in total.</font>

70
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:36,375
<font color="yellow">100,000 dollars per episode?</font>

71
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:38,775
<font color="yellow">It's not a small sum.</font>

72
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,875
<font color="yellow">They specifically asked for you, Young Bin.</font>

73
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,075
<font color="yellow">You have to pay for the breach, right?</font>

74
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:50,575
<font color="yellow">I want you to be a part of my agency so we can do this together.</font>

75
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,405
<font color="yellow">It's about time you make some real money.</font>

76
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,645
<font color="yellow">We'll have to talk about it.</font>

77
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,945
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

78
00:03:59,145 --> 00:04:02,445
<font color="yellow">Who made you that offer, by the way?</font>

79
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,715
<font color="yellow">Eun Gab showed me the script and told me about it.</font>

80
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:11,375
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

81
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,875
<font color="yellow">100,000 dollars per episode means...</font>

82
00:04:24,245 --> 00:04:27,005
<font color="yellow">You could purchase this entire store.</font>

83
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:30,675
<font color="yellow">Do you think Ms. Kang is right about "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

84
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:32,445
<font color="yellow">Should I do that Chinese drama?</font>

85
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:36,105
<font color="yellow">Speaking as a manager, that's what I'll tell you to do.</font>

86
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:37,845
<font color="yellow">- But as a friend? - Do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

87
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,805
<font color="yellow">I'll have to do "Lim Hwa Su", then.</font>

88
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:44,275
<font color="yellow">Do you think that will be okay with Ms. Kang?</font>

89
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:45,975
<font color="yellow">Don't you think she'll be against it?</font>

90
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:48,745
<font color="yellow">What should I do at times like this? Tell me as a manager.</font>

91
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:52,845
<font color="yellow">You should join her. It is the best agency out there.</font>

92
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,305
<font color="yellow">But as a friend?</font>

93
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,375
<font color="yellow">Can I be honest?</font>

94
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,675
<font color="yellow">You want me to work with Eun Gab? Forget it.</font>

95
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:02,575
<font color="yellow">Why did you ask, then? Don't ask in the first place.</font>

96
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,645
<font color="yellow">Let's just pick out Joon's clothes. He says he's not well sponsored.</font>

97
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,045
<font color="yellow">We should get Turtle something, too.</font>

98
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,775
<font color="yellow">I'm not into fashion. You can pick out their clothes.</font>

99
00:05:09,245 --> 00:05:11,405
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing this evening? - I'm going to see Ji An.</font>

100
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:14,645
<font color="yellow">What about me? I'll be alone with Joon and Turtle gone.</font>

101
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:16,575
<font color="yellow">Can't I go out on a date?</font>

102
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:18,745
<font color="yellow">I'll be bored. Some friend you are.</font>

103
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:23,545
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Can you buy me this? I want to give it to Ji An.</font>

104
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,105
<font color="yellow">- Don't tempt me. - It's 1,400 dollars.</font>

105
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:29,105
<font color="yellow">Let's do that Chinese drama.</font>

106
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:33,345
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

107
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,045
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

108
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,405
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

109
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:43,875
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you.</font>

110
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,945
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Let's go.</font>

111
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,745
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

112
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:49,975
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joon.</font>

113
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,145
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hey.</font>

114
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,905
<font color="yellow">Do you want to hear a joke?</font>

115
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:57,805
<font color="yellow">What do you call an unemployed strawberry?</font>

116
00:05:58,805 --> 00:05:59,805
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

117
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,575
<font color="yellow">Strawberry syrup.</font>

118
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:12,145
<font color="yellow">It's funny, right? Do you want to hear another one?</font>

119
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,345
<font color="yellow">What do you call the poorest king?</font>

120
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:18,445
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

121
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:21,905
<font color="yellow">Minimum wage.</font>

122
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:24,975
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

123
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:28,175
<font color="yellow">Aren't you too young to be making middle-aged men jokes?</font>

124
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,475
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, I feel like you're from the stone age.</font>

125
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,675
<font color="yellow">Those jokes were so bad.</font>

126
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:40,945
<font color="yellow">What are you?</font>

127
00:06:41,575 --> 00:06:44,375
<font color="yellow">- I'm your friend. - You're my manager.</font>

128
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,205
<font color="yellow">I'm warming myself up before I go into shooting.</font>

129
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,945
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - I was joking.</font>

130
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,945
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

131
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:57,405
<font color="yellow">A manager shouldn't demoralize the actor.</font>

132
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,005
<font color="yellow">Know your place.</font>

133
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,445
<font color="yellow">Go make me some coffee.</font>

134
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,145
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

135
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:09,205
<font color="yellow">That was funny, right?</font>

136
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,775
<font color="yellow">Here's your coffee.</font>

137
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,245
<font color="yellow">You took that long just to get this?</font>

138
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,705
<font color="yellow">There weren't any coffee shops nearby.</font>

139
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,405
<font color="yellow">People here don't have time for these.</font>

140
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,905
<font color="yellow">We all drink instant coffee.</font>

141
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,075
<font color="yellow">That's not what I saw on television.</font>

142
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:29,545
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

143
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:32,145
<font color="yellow">Do you want to drink this, Joon?</font>

144
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:42,145
<font color="yellow">Instant coffee is the way to go. "Instant coffee, ready to go."</font>

145
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,205
<font color="yellow">You always said it's too sweet.</font>

146
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,445
<font color="yellow">I'm on set right now.</font>

147
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,905
<font color="yellow">Why are you so stupid?</font>

148
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,805
<font color="yellow">You don't meet the requirements to become a manager.</font>

149
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,705
<font color="yellow">You should let Ho Jin teach you a thing or two.</font>

150
00:07:56,005 --> 00:07:59,575
<font color="yellow">I'm a manager, not a slave. What's wrong with you?</font>

151
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,375
<font color="yellow">You're not a slave.</font>

152
00:08:05,145 --> 00:08:06,275
<font color="yellow">What am I, then?</font>

153
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,205
<font color="yellow">You're not, but you have to take care of me.</font>

154
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,905
<font color="yellow">And you're doing none of that.</font>

155
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:20,545
<font color="yellow">Don't make a scene in front of all the staff members.</font>

156
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:24,105
<font color="yellow">Get it together.</font>

157
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,005
<font color="yellow">Get yourself together.</font>

158
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:49,075
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going around meeting agencies anymore?</font>

159
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,175
<font color="yellow">Did you decide to work with my mom?</font>

160
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,875
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

161
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:55,405
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

162
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:59,975
<font color="yellow">You're not doing it because of me, are you?</font>

163
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,345
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

164
00:09:03,045 --> 00:09:06,705
<font color="yellow">It was where we used to belong. And Ms. Kang is good to us.</font>

165
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:10,245
<font color="yellow">Yes. It doesn't concern me.</font>

166
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,975
<font color="yellow">So make your decision wisely.</font>

167
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:14,475
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

168
00:09:28,645 --> 00:09:30,675
<font color="yellow">Why would you knock if you're not going to wait for the response?</font>

169
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,315
<font color="yellow">At least, I knocked.</font>

170
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:36,145
<font color="yellow">What is it? Were you touching yourself?</font>

171
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,375
<font color="yellow">I'm not in the mood for that.</font>

172
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:41,375
<font color="yellow">Was it that bad?</font>

173
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:44,745
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if I didn't do good enough...</font>

174
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,975
<font color="yellow">or if Joon is being picky.</font>

175
00:09:47,175 --> 00:09:49,605
<font color="yellow">Joon's always been a sensitive guy. You know that.</font>

176
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:51,075
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

177
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:54,575
<font color="yellow">being friends and working together are two different things.</font>

178
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,245
<font color="yellow">It's amazing how Ho Jin is getting the job done.</font>

179
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,875
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to diss me as well?</font>

180
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,445
<font color="yellow">You actors.</font>

181
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:07,905
<font color="yellow">It must run in your family. Let's just put it at that.</font>

182
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,945
<font color="yellow">Am I like Joon, too?</font>

183
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:14,075
<font color="yellow">You know I'm right. You're so fickle.</font>

184
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:18,075
<font color="yellow">I was only a manager for a day, but it's a tough task.</font>

185
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:20,875
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin and Mr. Kim must have it rough.</font>

186
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:22,075
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

187
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:29,375
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to work with Eun Gab rather than Ms. Kang?</font>

188
00:10:29,575 --> 00:10:30,905
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask me that? Did Ho Jin say so?</font>

189
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:33,445
<font color="yellow">It's just that he still talks about him.</font>

190
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,175
<font color="yellow">You should listen to Ho Jin.</font>

191
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:37,575
<font color="yellow">He betrayed his future mother-in-law to do the right thing.</font>

192
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,845
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with everyone?</font>

193
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,945
<font color="yellow">You ought to listen to your manager,</font>

194
00:10:43,205 --> 00:10:44,705
<font color="yellow">you Cha Brothers.</font>

195
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:48,845
<font color="yellow">I don't know anymore. Get to work, you apprentice.</font>

196
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:51,205
<font color="yellow">I'm going to play League of Legends.</font>

197
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,845
<font color="yellow">What's my manager doing...</font>

198
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:00,345
<font color="yellow">when I have a shooting with female guests the day after tomorrow?</font>

199
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:01,805
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't he be more considerate?</font>

200
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,345
<font color="yellow">What don't you like about Turtle?</font>

201
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,075
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

202
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:07,805
<font color="yellow">I was mean to him on purpose.</font>

203
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:11,375
<font color="yellow">He's never been through a tough time in his life.</font>

204
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:14,575
<font color="yellow">It's a jungle out there. I need to give him tough love.</font>

205
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:16,205
<font color="yellow">This is his first time.</font>

206
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:19,545
<font color="yellow">He's been my manager all this time we've lived together.</font>

207
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,905
<font color="yellow">Not exactly.</font>

208
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:24,445
<font color="yellow">Be good to him. You know he has a soft heart.</font>

209
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:25,675
<font color="yellow">That is exactly why I need to be like this.</font>

210
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,575
<font color="yellow">You, me, and Young Bin had it hard when growing up.</font>

211
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:31,845
<font color="yellow">We've been through the hardest times in our lives.</font>

212
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,675
<font color="yellow">Turtle needs to go through this.</font>

213
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,575
<font color="yellow">He needs to learn a lesson.</font>

214
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:37,745
<font color="yellow">Joon.</font>

215
00:11:38,605 --> 00:11:40,145
<font color="yellow">When I first became a manager,</font>

216
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:43,305
<font color="yellow">it really lowered my self-esteem. I didn't know what I was doing.</font>

217
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:46,045
<font color="yellow">That's how everyone starts.</font>

218
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:49,475
<font color="yellow">I want to shape Turtle into a rock.</font>

219
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,305
<font color="yellow">The Cha Brothers are really something.</font>

220
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,275
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

221
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,745
<font color="yellow">What is it? Is your penis hurting again?</font>

222
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,475
<font color="yellow">Talking about Turtle made me want to poop.</font>

223
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:00,805
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Are you going to watch me poop?</font>

224
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,705
<font color="yellow">That's nasty.</font>

225
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:05,845
<font color="yellow">One, two, three, four.</font>

226
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,975
<font color="yellow">That's the highest number of viewers I got. Thank you.</font>

227
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:12,905
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll be streaming for sometime.</font>

228
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:15,375
<font color="yellow">I started working. I got a job.</font>

229
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:18,105
<font color="yellow">That's right. I got a job.</font>

230
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:22,005
<font color="yellow">Today was my first day and I don't think I can make it to the second.</font>

231
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,605
<font color="yellow">But I'll try my best.</font>

232
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,745
<font color="yellow">The world is a cruel place.</font>

233
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:29,175
<font color="yellow">I have respect for all the white collars out there.</font>

234
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:33,705
<font color="yellow">"I go to elementary school."</font>

235
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:35,975
<font color="yellow">You go to elementary school?</font>

236
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:38,845
<font color="yellow">Get out of here and go study.</font>

237
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,275
<font color="yellow">You don't want to be like me when you grow up.</font>

238
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:42,945
<font color="yellow">Stay healthy.</font>

239
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,805
<font color="yellow">The world is a brutal place.</font>

240
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,375
<font color="yellow">We can do it.</font>

241
00:12:49,705 --> 00:12:50,705
<font color="yellow">We can.</font>

242
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,445
<font color="yellow">Hey, Boss.</font>

243
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,245
<font color="yellow">- In your room... - What is it?</font>

244
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,575
<font color="yellow">- Boss. - What?</font>

245
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,545
<font color="yellow">What is she doing in here?</font>

246
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,105
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

247
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,745
<font color="yellow">Are you still hungover from last night?</font>

248
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:32,775
<font color="yellow">What brings you here? Did you come to check on me?</font>

249
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,575
<font color="yellow">It's a nice office, isn't it? It's cozy and fancy.</font>

250
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,445
<font color="yellow">It's a much better office than one in Ok Entertainment.</font>

251
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:41,875
<font color="yellow">This is it?</font>

252
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,345
<font color="yellow">It's so small just like what's in your pants.</font>

253
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,145
<font color="yellow">What's so good about it?</font>

254
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,445
<font color="yellow">You talk like you've seen it.</font>

255
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:50,245
<font color="yellow">I don't have to see it to know.</font>

256
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:54,005
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

257
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,145
<font color="yellow">gave Young Bin a script, didn't you?</font>

258
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,245
<font color="yellow">I need coffee. Is anyone there?</font>

259
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:02,375
<font color="yellow">Why did you give him that script?</font>

260
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:05,605
<font color="yellow">Do you still have attachments to him?</font>

261
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:21,105
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

262
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:29,375
<font color="yellow">Give it up. I'm going to sign him.</font>

263
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:31,745
<font color="yellow">He won't do that.</font>

264
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:35,605
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't he? I can top any other offer.</font>

265
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,905
<font color="yellow">I even got him a big role.</font>

266
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,075
<font color="yellow">Young Bin can't be moved by money.</font>

267
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:44,275
<font color="yellow">Does he move by loyalty, then?</font>

268
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,805
<font color="yellow">Is that why he abandoned you?</font>

269
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,145
<font color="yellow">You're the one who abandoned me.</font>

270
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,975
<font color="yellow">You spit me right back out as soon as I lost value to you.</font>

271
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,575
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever look in the mirror?</font>

272
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:00,675
<font color="yellow">You have a face of a money-grubbing hag.</font>

273
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,445
<font color="yellow">Watch it.</font>

274
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,545
<font color="yellow">You're on my turf now. Do you want me to get serious?</font>

275
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:08,275
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of fighting with you.</font>

276
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,175
<font color="yellow">I'll leave you to your petty tasks.</font>

277
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,075
<font color="yellow">I'll be busy with Young Bin.</font>

278
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:15,575
<font color="yellow">You came here to tell me that?</font>

279
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,745
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

280
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:23,875
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever go near Young Bin again.</font>

281
00:15:25,105 --> 00:15:28,375
<font color="yellow">First, the agency and now, Young Bin.</font>

282
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:31,775
<font color="yellow">Let's see how it goes.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hello. It's me, Ho Jin.</font>

288
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,545
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

289
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:13,705
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you for a favor?</font>

290
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:17,705
<font color="yellow">It's about "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

<font color="yellow">Joon and Turtle left me all alone. I'm bored.</font>

304
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:05,545
<font color="yellow">Can't you let me do my job? I'm not your girlfriend.</font>

305
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,975
<font color="yellow">- I'll be back soon. - Hurry.</font>

306
00:17:08,305 --> 00:17:10,305
<font color="yellow">- Don't forget to eat. - Okay.</font>

307
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,805
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin.</font>

308
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,045
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Long time no see.</font>

309
00:17:40,675 --> 00:17:43,275
<font color="yellow">- It's been so long. How are you? - I'm good.</font>

310
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:45,075
<font color="yellow">- This place is nice, right? - It is.</font>

311
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:48,515
<font color="yellow">Don't be fooling around. Come on in.</font>

312
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:51,015
<font color="yellow">What? We can't say hello?</font>

313
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,515
<font color="yellow">This isn't the back alley of Brooklyn or Itaewon.</font>

314
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:55,575
<font color="yellow">- Bye. - Catch you later.</font>

315
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,575
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

316
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:04,975
<font color="yellow">I've been meaning to take a look around here.</font>

317
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,475
<font color="yellow">Why did you name it "Tiger's Den"?</font>

318
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:15,805
<font color="yellow">Because it's a habitat of tigers like Young Bin.</font>

319
00:18:15,945 --> 00:18:17,345
<font color="yellow">- Is it weird? - No.</font>

320
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:21,145
<font color="yellow">I think it's a good name.</font>

321
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,015
<font color="yellow">"Bear's Den" would've been weird, though.</font>

322
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,775
<font color="yellow">What? Are you making fun of me?</font>

323
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:26,445
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

324
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,745
<font color="yellow">- Why did you... - Mr. Kim...</font>

325
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,905
<font color="yellow">- Never mind. - You go first.</font>

326
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:40,375
<font color="yellow">Well... I'm not so sure about Young Bin's signing the contract.</font>

327
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,545
<font color="yellow">It's been giving me a headache.</font>

328
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,345
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to sign the contract with Ms. Kang.</font>

329
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:49,075
<font color="yellow">I heard she renamed the agency to something ridiculous.</font>

330
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,475
<font color="yellow">We haven't made the decision yet.</font>

331
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:57,145
<font color="yellow">About the script you gave us...</font>

332
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,745
<font color="yellow">Does Young Bin want to do it?</font>

333
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:01,645
<font color="yellow">Of course, he does.</font>

334
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,575
<font color="yellow">But things are complicated with the film company involved.</font>

335
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,475
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang wants him to do this Chinese drama.</font>

336
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:15,145
<font color="yellow">I came to seek your advice.</font>

337
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,515
<font color="yellow">What kind of advice? I don't even work with him anymore.</font>

338
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:22,545
<font color="yellow">It's for you to worry about now. And since when do you listen to me?</font>

339
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,705
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

340
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:26,345
<font color="yellow">You always put it bluntly,</font>

341
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,605
<font color="yellow">but you always said the right things.</font>

342
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,875
<font color="yellow">You should've done better when you had the chance.</font>

343
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:35,175
<font color="yellow">The same goes for you.</font>

344
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,605
<font color="yellow">Look at you all grown up.</font>

345
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:41,645
<font color="yellow">You're on your own. A Chinese drama sounds nice.</font>

346
00:19:42,045 --> 00:19:44,745
<font color="yellow">You know how Young Bin wants to do movies.</font>

347
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:47,945
<font color="yellow">"Lim Hwa Su" isn't looking good.</font>

348
00:19:48,045 --> 00:19:49,575
<font color="yellow">I looked into the situation as well.</font>

349
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:54,245
<font color="yellow">If another production company buys the publication rights,</font>

350
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:56,145
<font color="yellow">things could work out.</font>

351
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,945
<font color="yellow">I do want to help Young Bin out, but...</font>

352
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,245
<font color="yellow">Please help us, Mr. Kim.</font>

353
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,375
<font color="yellow">But then,</font>

354
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:10,245
<font color="yellow">it'd look like I'm luring him.</font>

355
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:11,705
<font color="yellow">So be it, then.</font>

356
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:13,905
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

357
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,575
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

358
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:17,705
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

359
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:22,445
<font color="yellow">I still think the right thing to do is to work with you.</font>

360
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,975
<font color="yellow">What's with you today?</font>

361
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:28,745
<font color="yellow">How does Young Bin feel about it?</font>

362
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,945
<font color="yellow">He didn't say much,</font>

363
00:20:31,705 --> 00:20:33,445
<font color="yellow">but I think he's not as opposed as before.</font>

364
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:35,475
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

365
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:40,545
<font color="yellow">Should I pull some strings, then?</font>

366
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:41,945
<font color="yellow">You look so happy.</font>

367
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,205
<font color="yellow">I'm joking, of course.</font>

368
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,705
<font color="yellow">- I'm not interested. - Okay.</font>

369
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:48,375
<font color="yellow">I'll do it solely on behalf of wishing Young Bin well.</font>

370
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:50,745
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to look into it?</font>

371
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:52,905
<font color="yellow">A production company who can kick-start things?</font>

372
00:20:53,805 --> 00:20:55,045
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

373
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,575
<font color="yellow">- Is that what you got this morning? - It's nice, isn't it?</font>

374
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,705
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'm going to wear refined and sophisticated clothes.</font>

375
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,645
<font color="yellow">Like Jung Woo Sung and Lee Jung Jae.</font>

376
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:11,405
<font color="yellow">I'm a gentleman from now on.</font>

377
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:15,905
<font color="yellow">You're dying to make fun of me, aren't you?</font>

378
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,775
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything.</font>

379
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,375
<font color="yellow">You forgot to talk to the stylist again, didn't you?</font>

380
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:21,445
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

381
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,145
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'm on it.</font>

382
00:21:25,105 --> 00:21:26,175
<font color="yellow">Are you two still fighting?</font>

383
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:28,545
<font color="yellow">Did you see that? This is how he treats me.</font>

384
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:30,645
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll call her.</font>

385
00:21:37,405 --> 00:21:40,075
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Hye Jin. - Hello.</font>

386
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,875
<font color="yellow">I'm calling about Joon's outfit tomorrow.</font>

387
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,945
<font color="yellow">I said I wasn't up for it, but he forced me to style him.</font>

388
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:53,405
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that. Thank you. I'll come pick it up tomorrow.</font>

389
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,475
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You're very kind.</font>

390
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:01,575
<font color="yellow">Well, you're good to me so...</font>

391
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,105
<font color="yellow">- Of course... - Hey!</font>

392
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:05,245
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Excuse me.</font>

393
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:08,105
<font color="yellow">- What do you want me to say to her? - What are you doing with her?</font>

394
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:10,475
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to be flirting with the staff members.</font>

395
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:13,775
<font color="yellow">She was just saying thank you for picking up your outfit tomorrow.</font>

396
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,305
<font color="yellow">Get it together, will you?</font>

397
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:17,975
<font color="yellow">She's your co-worker.</font>

398
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:21,805
<font color="yellow">You're completely clueless.</font>

399
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,245
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Joon has lost his mind.</font>

400
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:27,275
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

401
00:22:28,205 --> 00:22:30,845
<font color="yellow">I heard him yelling. Are you okay?</font>

402
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:33,875
<font color="yellow">It's okay. He's not himself these days.</font>

403
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:35,775
<font color="yellow">He's picking on me for no reason.</font>

404
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:37,475
<font color="yellow">I didn't know this side of him.</font>

405
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:39,445
<font color="yellow">He's even more sensitive than usual.</font>

406
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:44,105
<font color="yellow">He is. By the way, do you know anyone whom I can introduce him to?</font>

407
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,705
<font color="yellow">I think he'll get better with a woman in his life.</font>

408
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:51,205
<font color="yellow">He's been asking me to introduce someone I know for long.</font>

409
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,105
<font color="yellow">You should introduce him to her.</font>

410
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:56,405
<font color="yellow">That's great. I'll do that. Okay.</font>

411
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,375
<font color="yellow">Jerk. Joon.</font>

412
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,945
<font color="yellow">Looks like this isn't that good of a fishing spot.</font>

413
00:23:07,405 --> 00:23:11,705
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me, Mr. Kim Eun Gab?</font>

414
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:16,375
<font color="yellow">I just came to say hello after starting my own agency.</font>

415
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:21,205
<font color="yellow">I haven't gotten over from what happened last time. Go away.</font>

416
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:26,645
<font color="yellow">Let's not dwell on the past. It's time to join forces.</font>

417
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:28,905
<font color="yellow">Do you come here often?</font>

418
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:33,205
<font color="yellow">You're not getting anything. Is this fun to you?</font>

419
00:23:36,105 --> 00:23:37,105
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

420
00:23:38,275 --> 00:23:39,675
<font color="yellow">It's so much fun. Are you satisfied?</font>

421
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:42,275
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake. You startled me.</font>

422
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:43,405
<font color="yellow">I startled you?</font>

423
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:45,905
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to show you what I'm really capable of?</font>

424
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,475
<font color="yellow">You scared me last time with that webfoot octopus.</font>

425
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:49,705
<font color="yellow">So what do you want now?</font>

426
00:23:50,745 --> 00:23:53,445
<font color="yellow">And you. You were there too, weren't you?</font>

427
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,405
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - My gosh.</font>

428
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:59,205
<font color="yellow">You have some nerves coming to see me after what you did.</font>

429
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:01,445
<font color="yellow">And we talked it all out.</font>

430
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:04,075
<font color="yellow">Not for me. I'm still angry.</font>

431
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:07,705
<font color="yellow">- That's enough now. - "That's enough now"?</font>

432
00:24:08,205 --> 00:24:10,375
<font color="yellow">- Why you little... - Please.</font>

433
00:24:10,475 --> 00:24:13,175
<font color="yellow">- This is really important for us. - Shut it!</font>

434
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,845
<font color="yellow">Stay right there.</font>

435
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,445
<font color="yellow">- He's really going to throw it. - Hey!</font>

436
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:20,605
<font color="yellow">Come back here!</font>

437
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,205
<font color="yellow">I'm going to teach you a lesson.</font>

438
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:24,945
<font color="yellow">Those brats.</font>

439
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:27,775
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

440
00:24:32,905 --> 00:24:35,575
<font color="yellow">Coffee tastes the best on fishing spots.</font>

441
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,205
<font color="yellow">I like "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

442
00:24:43,305 --> 00:24:46,675
<font color="yellow">It's got a big scale and the gangster action people like.</font>

443
00:24:46,975 --> 00:24:49,875
<font color="yellow">It's got quality and potential.</font>

444
00:24:49,945 --> 00:24:51,705
<font color="yellow">It's a move that can't go wrong.</font>

445
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:55,075
<font color="yellow">Let's do it, then.</font>

446
00:24:56,045 --> 00:25:00,375
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I can make people invest with Cha Young Bin.</font>

447
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:04,045
<font color="yellow">CJ and Lotte will all line up to be a part of it.</font>

448
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:05,805
<font color="yellow">Then we're good to go, right?</font>

449
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,575
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

450
00:25:09,905 --> 00:25:12,505
<font color="yellow">Start catching some fish. I told you loud and clear.</font>

451
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,545
<font color="yellow">But even you can't catch anything here.</font>

452
00:25:16,545 --> 00:25:18,575
<font color="yellow">Shut it. You have to catch a big one.</font>

453
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:22,205
<font color="yellow">It has to be a local carp. The big one.</font>

454
00:25:22,305 --> 00:25:25,175
<font color="yellow">You promised that you'll produce this movie if we do.</font>

455
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:29,475
<font color="yellow">Yes. Please do.</font>

456
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,305
<font color="yellow">If you do, I'll go purchase the publication rights right away.</font>

457
00:25:33,405 --> 00:25:36,975
<font color="yellow">I'll sign Young Bin right away. Please do catch it.</font>

458
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:40,775
<font color="yellow">Why is he being so mean?</font>

459
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:44,405
<font color="yellow">I've never caught fish other than fishing for my wife.</font>

460
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:45,905
<font color="yellow">This is my very first time.</font>

461
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,575
<font color="yellow">And I'm scared of fish.</font>

462
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:51,805
<font color="yellow">- Aren't they really slippery? - Do you want me to be scary?</font>

463
00:25:52,805 --> 00:25:55,205
<font color="yellow">You can give up now if you're not up to it.</font>

464
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:59,405
<font color="yellow">How can he hear us from that far out? I'm not getting anything.</font>

465
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:01,245
<font color="yellow">It went in.</font>

466
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:03,445
<font color="yellow">Did I get something?</font>

467
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:06,545
<font color="yellow">Wait, I got something. It's coming up.</font>

468
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:07,905
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

469
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:09,645
<font color="yellow">- I caught one. - Hold on.</font>

470
00:26:09,905 --> 00:26:12,575
<font color="yellow">- Oh, gosh. - Hold on. Give it to me.</font>

471
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:15,345
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's a strong one.</font>

472
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:17,645
<font color="yellow">- There it is. - It's coming out.</font>

473
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,905
<font color="yellow">- Hand me the net. - Okay.</font>

474
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:23,045
<font color="yellow">We got it.</font>

475
00:26:24,075 --> 00:26:25,375
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

476
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:28,045
<font color="yellow">We caught it.</font>

477
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,245
<font color="yellow">This is the one, right? You have to do the movie.</font>

478
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,505
<font color="yellow">We caught it.</font>

479
00:26:32,645 --> 00:26:34,275
<font color="yellow">- We did it. - We did it.</font>

480
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:37,345
<font color="yellow">- How is this possible? - Look at that.</font>

481
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:43,545
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

482
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:45,475
<font color="yellow">What have you been up to the entire day?</font>

483
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:48,475
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

484
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,675
<font color="yellow">I don't like eating alone.</font>

485
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:51,805
<font color="yellow">You're an actor. Take care of your body.</font>

486
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:53,805
<font color="yellow">You're a manager. Take care of your actor.</font>

487
00:26:54,545 --> 00:26:55,605
<font color="yellow">What did you do all day?</font>

488
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:59,245
<font color="yellow">I had to see someone. Gosh, let's just break up.</font>

489
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:02,205
<font color="yellow">What did you do all day?</font>

490
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,305
<font color="yellow">I read the script of that Chinese drama.</font>

491
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:09,975
<font color="yellow">I haven't gotten the chance to read it myself.</font>

492
00:27:10,575 --> 00:27:11,605
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

493
00:27:13,205 --> 00:27:14,705
<font color="yellow">But I can't keep reading when I don't want to do it.</font>

494
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,145
<font color="yellow">I want to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

495
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,045
<font color="yellow">You know how stubborn I get when I set my mind on something.</font>

496
00:27:25,475 --> 00:27:27,475
<font color="yellow">Where are Turtle and Joon?</font>

497
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:30,275
<font color="yellow">They were busy all day preparing for shooting.</font>

498
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:34,745
<font color="yellow">- There they are. - Guys.</font>

499
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:36,975
<font color="yellow">Do you know what day it is tomorrow?</font>

500
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:39,405
<font color="yellow">It's the day I get to shoot with actress Moon Geun Young.</font>

501
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:41,005
<font color="yellow">- What? - Why?</font>

502
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:43,975
<font color="yellow">You know how our show is about celebrities going through hard time?</font>

503
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:47,875
<font color="yellow">I'll be Moon Geun Young's manager for tomorrow and the day after.</font>

504
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:52,475
<font color="yellow">I'm jealous. I want to be Moon Geun Young's manager.</font>

505
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:54,875
<font color="yellow">Not this jerk.</font>

506
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:56,705
<font color="yellow">- Me, too. - Be quiet.</font>

507
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:59,475
<font color="yellow">Stay put. I'll make you dinner after I get washed up.</font>

508
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:00,945
<font color="yellow">Hey. Water.</font>

509
00:28:03,105 --> 00:28:04,205
<font color="yellow">I'm his water cooler.</font>

510
00:28:05,205 --> 00:28:06,845
<font color="yellow">That's harsh, Joon.</font>

511
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,275
<font color="yellow">- Water. - Shut it.</font>

512
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:11,275
<font color="yellow">This is going to hurt.</font>

513
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,505
<font color="yellow">- Fine. - Brace yourself.</font>

514
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,875
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

515
00:28:22,775 --> 00:28:24,075
<font color="yellow">How long has it been since they went bankrupt?</font>

516
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:28,375
<font color="yellow">New Seoul Production. That's a long forgotten name.</font>

517
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:31,045
<font color="yellow">How did a film company with 30 years of experience go bankrupt?</font>

518
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:34,005
<font color="yellow">At school, they taught us they're the cradle of Korean film industry.</font>

519
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,145
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

520
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:38,305
<font color="yellow">(New Seoul)</font>

521
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:39,445
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

522
00:28:43,545 --> 00:28:45,175
<font color="yellow">I don't think there's anyone in there.</font>

523
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:49,145
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Who's that?</font>

524
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,975
<font color="yellow">Who are you people?</font>

525
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:56,475
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

526
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:59,005
<font color="yellow">Aren't you...</font>

527
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,275
<font color="yellow">Kim Eun Gab?</font>

528
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:04,505
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's been too long.</font>

529
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:10,475
<font color="yellow">- I think it was three years ago. - What was?</font>

530
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:14,675
<font color="yellow">I asked you to take a look at a script...</font>

531
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:18,545
<font color="yellow">and you didn't get back to me for two long months.</font>

532
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:21,705
<font color="yellow">I can't remember clearly,</font>

533
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:24,975
<font color="yellow">but I think the actor was involved in many lawsuits.</font>

534
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:28,545
<font color="yellow">Not only did you not get back at us,</font>

535
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:31,245
<font color="yellow">but you kept making demands after demands.</font>

536
00:29:31,505 --> 00:29:35,005
<font color="yellow">That's how it works these days.</font>

537
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,845
<font color="yellow">That was never the case in the old days.</font>

538
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,775
<font color="yellow">Actors have difficult personalities.</font>

539
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:42,375
<font color="yellow">And investors behave like they own everything.</font>

540
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:44,445
<font color="yellow">Making movies these days is too darn difficult.</font>

541
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,645
<font color="yellow">Everyone takes the film company for granted.</font>

542
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,275
<font color="yellow">I hear you loud and clear.</font>

543
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:53,875
<font color="yellow">By the way, I heard the production for "Lim Hwa Su" has been halted.</font>

544
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,505
<font color="yellow">The project was about to get started...</font>

545
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,875
<font color="yellow">before the actor bailed out on us.</font>

546
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:02,105
<font color="yellow">It's so irresponsible of them.</font>

547
00:30:04,505 --> 00:30:06,775
<font color="yellow">This is my retirement project.</font>

548
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,975
<font color="yellow">I spent a lot of time and effort on this.</font>

549
00:30:09,045 --> 00:30:11,505
<font color="yellow">I couldn't keep the company afloat after what happened.</font>

550
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:15,845
<font color="yellow">Do you still have the rights for "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

551
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,375
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

552
00:30:17,475 --> 00:30:20,045
<font color="yellow">I see. The script is really good.</font>

553
00:30:20,145 --> 00:30:22,805
<font color="yellow">We really want to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

554
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,775
<font color="yellow">If it's with Young Bin, I'll definitely get funding.</font>

555
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,045
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - By the way,</font>

556
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:30,045
<font color="yellow">you said you're his manager, right?</font>

557
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:33,375
<font color="yellow">- Go. - Yes.</font>

558
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:35,845
<font color="yellow">- You like the script? - Yes.</font>

559
00:30:36,505 --> 00:30:37,505
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

560
00:30:38,105 --> 00:30:39,305
<font color="yellow">really read it?</font>

561
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:41,745
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

562
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,305
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

563
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:49,475
<font color="yellow">Does a manager even know how to read scripts?</font>

564
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:51,875
<font color="yellow">Don't be so old-fashioned.</font>

565
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:55,405
<font color="yellow">I'm not old-fashioned.</font>

566
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,475
<font color="yellow">Even these days, they read...</font>

567
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:01,345
<font color="yellow">only their actor's parts and talk nonsense to me.</font>

568
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:07,245
<font color="yellow">One should read the full script and understand it as a whole.</font>

569
00:31:07,705 --> 00:31:09,445
<font color="yellow">They talk about how big or small their parts are,</font>

570
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:12,645
<font color="yellow">and that the character is too dark or too light.</font>

571
00:31:12,645 --> 00:31:15,105
<font color="yellow">Not all managers are like that.</font>

572
00:31:15,145 --> 00:31:18,545
<font color="yellow">Sure, they used to be gangsters.</font>

573
00:31:18,675 --> 00:31:21,305
<font color="yellow">These days, they're more sly.</font>

574
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:23,745
<font color="yellow">Are you going to hand over the rights or not?</font>

575
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:25,305
<font color="yellow">It's up to me. It's my film.</font>

576
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,205
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make the film or not?</font>

577
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:29,845
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Sir, I...</font>

578
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,005
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

579
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,775
<font color="yellow">Do you know Mr. Ahn from Fish Film?</font>

580
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:36,775
<font color="yellow">We already had a talk with them.</font>

581
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:38,675
<font color="yellow">As long as you give us the permission,</font>

582
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:41,875
<font color="yellow">we'd like to move forward with it. Please consider it.</font>

583
00:31:43,475 --> 00:31:44,975
<font color="yellow">Let's do it this way.</font>

584
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,075
<font color="yellow">300,000 dollars for research and development.</font>

585
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:51,175
<font color="yellow">I want 30 percent of the production company's share. How's that?</font>

586
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,905
<font color="yellow">That's a bit too much.</font>

587
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:56,675
<font color="yellow">You're not trying to make the film. You're just trying to make money.</font>

588
00:31:56,745 --> 00:31:58,605
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

589
00:31:58,805 --> 00:32:01,205
<font color="yellow">- Just don't do it, then! - No, Sir.</font>

590
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:03,205
<font color="yellow">Forget it!</font>

591
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:06,575
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - My goodness.</font>

592
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,045
<font color="yellow">What a stubborn man.</font>

593
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,705
<font color="yellow">He's trying to ruin us.</font>

594
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:14,375
<font color="yellow">He's so old-fashioned. He's putting up a show.</font>

595
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,275
<font color="yellow">Let's just try to persuade him.</font>

596
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:17,905
<font color="yellow">Persuade him? Didn't you just see?</font>

597
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:21,845
<font color="yellow">He thinks managers are gangsters. He won't listen to us.</font>

598
00:32:21,945 --> 00:32:23,805
<font color="yellow">What? 300,000 dollars? 30 percent?</font>

599
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:27,275
<font color="yellow">Isn't he saying this because of what you did before?</font>

600
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:30,175
<font color="yellow">I only did what I should do as a manager.</font>

601
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,375
<font color="yellow">We all try to collaborate,</font>

602
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,875
<font color="yellow">but they only care about the film while we only care about talents.</font>

603
00:32:35,975 --> 00:32:38,405
<font color="yellow">No wonder we run into conflicts when we work together.</font>

604
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:40,745
<font color="yellow">- That's true, but... - Hey, let's go.</font>

605
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:44,345
<font color="yellow">They have a young producer at this production company.</font>

606
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:47,675
<font color="yellow">I bet they have some say in this. It'd be faster to talk to them.</font>

607
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:51,075
<font color="yellow">I'll just try to persuade the CEO.</font>

608
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:54,345
<font color="yellow">I want to make this film, too.</font>

609
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:57,675
<font color="yellow">However, I can't work with him. He's impossible to talk to.</font>

610
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,405
<font color="yellow">Just let me try.</font>

611
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,975
<font color="yellow">I'm sure something will work out if I keep trying.</font>

612
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:05,175
<font color="yellow">You're so stubborn. You're just like Young Bin.</font>

613
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,945
<font color="yellow">You're doing something useless.</font>

614
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:09,445
<font color="yellow">I don't care. I'm leaving.</font>

615
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:13,145
<font color="yellow">Do what you want. I need some coffee.</font>

616
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:17,805
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

617
00:33:30,105 --> 00:33:31,205
<font color="yellow">I don't know anymore.</font>

618
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:46,775
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

619
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:49,105
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

620
00:33:52,045 --> 00:33:53,045
<font color="yellow">What about this?</font>

621
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:55,105
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at the cue sheets.</font>

622
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,645
<font color="yellow">Can't you see?</font>

623
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:58,875
<font color="yellow">Don't play music in the car anymore.</font>

624
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:02,075
<font color="yellow">Then you should have stayed at the cafe. Why did you come here?</font>

625
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:05,075
<font color="yellow">I'm focusing on the cue sheets while waiting for Moon Geun Young.</font>

626
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,815
<font color="yellow">I'm sensitive. I'm really sensitive right now.</font>

627
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:11,475
<font color="yellow">Are you filming "The Throne"?</font>

628
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:13,005
<font color="yellow">I'm her biggest fan.</font>

629
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,345
<font color="yellow">It may be short, but I want to do it properly.</font>

630
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:18,475
<font color="yellow">Can you be a proper manager for once?</font>

631
00:34:18,705 --> 00:34:20,645
<font color="yellow">You're talking better than usual.</font>

632
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,705
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

633
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:33,345
<font color="yellow">Is this how you're like when you work?</font>

634
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,445
<font color="yellow">Why are you so cranky?</font>

635
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,945
<font color="yellow">If you keep this up, I'll get mad.</font>

636
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:42,845
<font color="yellow">I'm even planning to set you up with girls.</font>

637
00:34:42,975 --> 00:34:44,105
<font color="yellow">I'm setting you up...</font>

638
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:48,745
<font color="yellow">What? What? What is it now?</font>

639
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:51,445
<font color="yellow">Are you listening to music? I thought you wanted it turned off.</font>

640
00:34:51,815 --> 00:34:54,445
<font color="yellow">Even Yoo Jae Seok doesn't let people play music in the car.</font>

641
00:34:56,745 --> 00:35:00,045
<font color="yellow">It's actually nicer to listen to music with earphones.</font>

642
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,475
<font color="yellow">We'll see you in a moment.</font>

643
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:12,345
<font color="yellow">Don't change the channel.</font>

644
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:15,245
<font color="yellow">Cut. Lunch break.</font>

645
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,005
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your lunch. Enjoy.</font>

646
00:35:17,345 --> 00:35:19,005
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your lunch. It's hot, right? - Yes.</font>

647
00:35:19,545 --> 00:35:21,075
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your lunch. - Thank you.</font>

648
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,405
<font color="yellow">Enjoy your lunch. Enjoy.</font>

649
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:24,975
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy your lunch. - Okay.</font>

650
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:29,975
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat. I heard we're going to finish early today.</font>

651
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,175
<font color="yellow">- I guess so? - You guess so?</font>

652
00:35:32,645 --> 00:35:35,245
<font color="yellow">They didn't get enough content, so they have to shoot tomorrow.</font>

653
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:38,245
<font color="yellow">Why are they shooting one episode over two days?</font>

654
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:40,105
<font color="yellow">Did you tell them I'm available?</font>

655
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:41,845
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

656
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,405
<font color="yellow">Are you stupid? You really...</font>

657
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:47,005
<font color="yellow">You need to use your brain.</font>

658
00:35:47,705 --> 00:35:50,545
<font color="yellow">Joon, did you hear the news? I'm so sorry.</font>

659
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:54,075
<font color="yellow">It's okay. We should shoot until we get enough content.</font>

660
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,105
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter even if it's three days.</font>

661
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,545
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Good luck.</font>

662
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:01,245
<font color="yellow">- What is that? - You're supposed to fight for me.</font>

663
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:04,945
<font color="yellow">The manager is supposed to be evil while the actor is kind.</font>

664
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:06,345
<font color="yellow">Those are our roles. Don't you know?</font>

665
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,405
<font color="yellow">You're always with Young Bin and me. Why don't you know it?</font>

666
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,375
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

667
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,875
<font color="yellow">I have good news.</font>

668
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:16,605
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

669
00:36:16,605 --> 00:36:18,675
<font color="yellow">I set up a blind date for you to cheer you up.</font>

670
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:20,675
<font color="yellow">A blind date?</font>

671
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:24,045
<font color="yellow">- I guess that's nice. - What is it?</font>

672
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:26,745
<font color="yellow">Ever since seeing Geun Young, I don't feel like it.</font>

673
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:30,245
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? That's nonsense. You guys don't match.</font>

674
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:31,845
<font color="yellow">She's not that much younger than me.</font>

675
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,505
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about your faces.</font>

676
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:38,005
<font color="yellow">You guys would look so weird together.</font>

677
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,075
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

678
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,815
<font color="yellow">It's the truth. I was just being honest.</font>

679
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:44,975
<font color="yellow">I'm on a reality show.</font>

680
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:50,145
<font color="yellow">I have to make people laugh. Why do you keep making me angry?</font>

681
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:53,345
<font color="yellow">Also, I have to focus on work. A blind date?</font>

682
00:36:53,905 --> 00:36:55,315
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be responsible for scandals?</font>

683
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:58,445
<font color="yellow">Please put some sense into you.</font>

684
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,075
<font color="yellow">Aren't you curious what common sense is?</font>

685
00:37:01,315 --> 00:37:02,975
<font color="yellow">I'm not eating. No, I can't eat.</font>

686
00:37:03,045 --> 00:37:05,205
<font color="yellow">I have no appetite because of you. Bring me cup noodles.</font>

687
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:30,345
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

688
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:46,175
<font color="yellow">Look at this part.</font>

689
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:45,315
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

690
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,045
<font color="yellow">You're still here?</font>

691
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:54,205
<font color="yellow">Yes. I wanted to talk to you.</font>

692
00:38:54,575 --> 00:38:56,245
<font color="yellow">I already told you the conditions.</font>

693
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:57,745
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

694
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:00,375
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at this?</font>

695
00:39:00,645 --> 00:39:02,975
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was just here.</font>

696
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:04,705
<font color="yellow">You don't even know what it is.</font>

697
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,945
<font color="yellow">I was young so I didn't get to see this film when it was released,</font>

698
00:39:09,045 --> 00:39:11,945
<font color="yellow">but I know of "Suddenly at Midnight".</font>

699
00:39:12,105 --> 00:39:14,275
<font color="yellow">You know "Suddenly at Midnight"?</font>

700
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:16,775
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's a psychological mystery film...</font>

701
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,705
<font color="yellow">that was ahead of its time.</font>

702
00:39:18,905 --> 00:39:22,975
<font color="yellow">It's a popular horror film from the 1980s, along with "Woman's Wail".</font>

703
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:26,775
<font color="yellow">You know "Suddenly at Midnight"? I'm surprised.</font>

704
00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:29,105
<font color="yellow">What does a manager know about scripts?</font>

705
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:32,575
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

706
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:35,845
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I can say this,</font>

707
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:38,275
<font color="yellow">but I used to work in film.</font>

708
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,315
<font color="yellow">There were people who were good and bad at reading scripts.</font>

709
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,345
<font color="yellow">I think it's the same thing when it comes to managers.</font>

710
00:39:45,575 --> 00:39:46,815
<font color="yellow">Were you in film before?</font>

711
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:49,845
<font color="yellow">Yes, I was in a production team before.</font>

712
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:54,245
<font color="yellow">That's nothing. You call that work? You don't know anything.</font>

713
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:55,675
<font color="yellow">Right. It's nothing.</font>

714
00:39:56,475 --> 00:39:58,405
<font color="yellow">I don't know much and I'm not a film person.</font>

715
00:39:58,705 --> 00:40:02,845
<font color="yellow">However, I know that "Lim Hwa Su" is a good film.</font>

716
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,005
<font color="yellow">You know that as well.</font>

717
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:08,445
<font color="yellow">You're a knowledgeable person in film,</font>

718
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,905
<font color="yellow">yet you're about to lose your chance in giving life to that project.</font>

719
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,145
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

720
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,645
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to offend you.</font>

721
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:20,845
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you all this because I really want to do it.</font>

722
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,045
<font color="yellow">As you know, I'm Young Bin's manager,</font>

723
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:29,075
<font color="yellow">but we've also been best friends since we were kids.</font>

724
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:32,105
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is very eager to do this, too.</font>

725
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:37,315
<font color="yellow">Please help us out. Please consider taking less on the cost and profit.</font>

726
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:40,345
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

727
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,645
<font color="yellow">there's one more condition.</font>

728
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,375
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

729
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:53,475
<font color="yellow">The CEO of New Seoul...</font>

730
00:40:54,505 --> 00:40:57,315
<font color="yellow">is willing to go easy on the budget and profit.</font>

731
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,145
<font color="yellow">On one condition, though.</font>

732
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:00,605
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

733
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:02,315
<font color="yellow">Well, it's...</font>

734
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,745
<font color="yellow">He would like you...</font>

735
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,505
<font color="yellow">to apologize to him. Then he'll help us out.</font>

736
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:10,705
<font color="yellow">What? Why should I apologize to him? What did I do wrong?</font>

737
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:13,605
<font color="yellow">I think that he has been holding a grudge against you.</font>

738
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:17,075
<font color="yellow">He also said that you were out of line earlier.</font>

739
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:21,575
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm crazy? I went easy on that old wretch because he's old.</font>

740
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:25,275
<font color="yellow">Forget it and just stay right there. I'll be there shortly.</font>

741
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,145
<font color="yellow">Does he think I'm a joke or what?</font>

742
00:41:27,975 --> 00:41:29,005
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

743
00:41:37,105 --> 00:41:40,475
<font color="yellow">Please help us out. Even a little bit would be a big help to us.</font>

744
00:41:41,245 --> 00:41:43,905
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologize if I've made you upset in any way.</font>

745
00:41:44,815 --> 00:41:47,005
<font color="yellow">Well, all right.</font>

746
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:49,105
<font color="yellow">Apology accepted.</font>

747
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,945
<font color="yellow">Then how does 150,000 dollars with a 15-percent profit sound?</font>

748
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:57,905
<font color="yellow">170,000 dollars with a 17-percent profit.</font>

749
00:41:59,405 --> 00:42:01,605
<font color="yellow">Sure! I'll pass that information along.</font>

750
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,945
<font color="yellow">- Let's settle it at that. - Okay.</font>

751
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,975
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I've always admired you.</font>

752
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:20,297
<font color="yellow">- I had to hold myself back. - Thank you for doing that.</font>

753
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:22,605
<font color="yellow">You annoy me just as much. How can you...</font>

754
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,175
<font color="yellow">We got what we wanted, so it's all good.</font>

755
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:28,445
<font color="yellow">That bull-headed old grouch...</font>

756
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:32,545
<font color="yellow">He said he didn't feel good about "Lim Hwa Su" going to waste.</font>

757
00:42:32,905 --> 00:42:35,245
<font color="yellow">He's a real cineaste. He certainly lives up to his name.</font>

758
00:42:35,505 --> 00:42:36,945
<font color="yellow">We're real managers, too.</font>

759
00:42:37,505 --> 00:42:40,345
<font color="yellow">That old man has bias against managers.</font>

760
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,315
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I got him to give us permission,</font>

761
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:46,405
<font color="yellow">so you should persuade Mr. Ahn about the profit structure.</font>

762
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,045
<font color="yellow">I've done my job.</font>

763
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,745
<font color="yellow">You sure have a way with words.</font>

764
00:42:50,815 --> 00:42:52,445
<font color="yellow">I know. I learned it all from you.</font>

765
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:55,205
<font color="yellow">- Don't I look like a manager now? - Cut it out, you fool.</font>

766
00:42:55,845 --> 00:42:58,205
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mr. Ahn will lose it on me.</font>

767
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:01,675
<font color="yellow">- What should I do? - You'll figure it out.</font>

768
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:15,575
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

769
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:19,575
<font color="yellow">I have no money...</font>

770
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:24,675
<font color="yellow">Why am I broke even on this thing?</font>

771
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:26,745
<font color="yellow">Game over!</font>

772
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:35,475
<font color="yellow">Everything in my life is going bust, including this game.</font>

773
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:43,775
<font color="yellow">(Joon)</font>

774
00:43:43,875 --> 00:43:44,875
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

775
00:44:01,845 --> 00:44:05,105
<font color="yellow">Right, I know. I had to haggle to get it down to that amount.</font>

776
00:44:05,205 --> 00:44:07,005
<font color="yellow">It's good enough to be a win-win situation.</font>

777
00:44:07,105 --> 00:44:08,405
<font color="yellow">Win-win situation, my foot.</font>

778
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:11,375
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park must think that I'm a complete idiot.</font>

779
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:13,845
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some of this? - He doesn't.</font>

780
00:44:14,545 --> 00:44:17,775
<font color="yellow">Why are both of you so money hungry? You'll die before me anyway.</font>

781
00:44:17,805 --> 00:44:19,405
<font color="yellow">People live to be 100 years old nowadays.</font>

782
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,905
<font color="yellow">I'll need money even if I go senile and end up smearing feces on walls.</font>

783
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:25,105
<font color="yellow">- Why are you talking about feces? - Gosh, that's disgusting.</font>

784
00:44:25,605 --> 00:44:28,175
<font color="yellow">I am going to buy the rights from him,</font>

785
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:30,975
<font color="yellow">but the share he's asking... I guess I'll have to give it to him.</font>

786
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:34,005
<font color="yellow">If we ask him to lower it more, he'll cause a scene at my office.</font>

787
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,745
<font color="yellow">I'll have to clean up after his dead body.</font>

788
00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:38,205
<font color="yellow">I'll clean up after his dead body with you. Just buy the rights.</font>

789
00:44:38,705 --> 00:44:39,975
<font color="yellow">Mom, I can't eat this anymore.</font>

790
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,375
<font color="yellow">Honey, come eat spaghetti with us.</font>

791
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:45,245
<font color="yellow">Cha Young Bin is signing a contract with you, right?</font>

792
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:47,875
<font color="yellow">- Well, that's... - I'll think that it's the case.</font>

793
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:49,745
<font color="yellow">I'll move ahead with this right away.</font>

794
00:44:50,175 --> 00:44:52,905
<font color="yellow">Okay. Buy the rights as soon as possible. Yes, let's talk soon.</font>

795
00:44:56,745 --> 00:44:58,175
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

796
00:44:58,705 --> 00:44:59,875
<font color="yellow">Are you going to eat this or not?</font>

797
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:03,875
<font color="yellow">I should eat, of course. It looks delicious. I live to eat, you know?</font>

798
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,075
<font color="yellow">Bring a fork.</font>

799
00:45:06,075 --> 00:45:08,275
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am. Where do we keep forks?</font>

800
00:45:09,105 --> 00:45:12,145
<font color="yellow">Where are they? Down here? Where are all the forks?</font>

801
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:22,705
<font color="yellow">Yes, just a moment. I was just in the elevator. Hang on.</font>

802
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:26,145
<font color="yellow">Yes, you can talk now.</font>

803
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:28,775
<font color="yellow">I can't even talk on the phone comfortably at home anymore.</font>

804
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:30,745
<font color="yellow">Even if it's about work?</font>

805
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:32,445
<font color="yellow">Get married, and you'll find out what it's like.</font>

806
00:45:33,075 --> 00:45:35,405
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I had a talk with Mr. Ahn and he's on board.</font>

807
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:38,605
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and just move ahead with the project.</font>

808
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:39,845
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

809
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,945
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ahn thinks that Young Bin has signed a contract with me.</font>

810
00:45:43,345 --> 00:45:44,745
<font color="yellow">He won't want to work with me, though.</font>

811
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:48,275
<font color="yellow">Whether it's with Ok Ja or whoever else, just go ahead with it.</font>

812
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:52,145
<font color="yellow">How could I? You're the one who made it happen.</font>

813
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:54,805
<font color="yellow">What can I do, though? It's all right.</font>

814
00:45:54,975 --> 00:45:56,875
<font color="yellow">What matters is Young Bin does the film he likes.</font>

815
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:58,745
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

816
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:02,105
<font color="yellow">All right, then. You're at home, right?</font>

817
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,445
<font color="yellow">Pass on the great news to Young Bin.</font>

818
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:08,145
<font color="yellow">- And don't tell him about me. - Pardon me?</font>

819
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:15,205
<font color="yellow">I should tell him that you helped. You don't want him to know?</font>

820
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:19,375
<font color="yellow">He has a lot of pride, you know? He doesn't like getting help.</font>

821
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,605
<font color="yellow">He and I are strangers now.</font>

822
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,205
<font color="yellow">Well, all right. I'll call you again soon.</font>

823
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,205
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

824
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:41,175
<font color="yellow">Gosh, there you are. My busy bee, Mr. Lee.</font>

825
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,605
<font color="yellow">I've been busy because of you. It's all because of you.</font>

826
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,375
<font color="yellow">It looks like you can do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

827
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:53,605
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

828
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,375
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

829
00:46:57,275 --> 00:47:00,475
<font color="yellow">You know Mr. Ahn, right? He's going to produce the film.</font>

830
00:47:00,805 --> 00:47:03,575
<font color="yellow">You're going to sign a contract as soon as he buys the rights.</font>

831
00:47:03,675 --> 00:47:06,375
<font color="yellow">- He's not exactly fond of me. - He hates you.</font>

832
00:47:07,105 --> 00:47:08,375
<font color="yellow">You'll have to win him over now.</font>

833
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:12,075
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I had no idea you were this capable.</font>

834
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:13,875
<font color="yellow">How did you do that?</font>

835
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:16,875
<font color="yellow">Stop asking. You're so full of questions.</font>

836
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,645
<font color="yellow">That's why I was busy today. Are we good now?</font>

837
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:21,175
<font color="yellow">No. You're acting strange.</font>

838
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:25,575
<font color="yellow">You got all of that done without telling me a word about it?</font>

839
00:47:27,475 --> 00:47:29,405
<font color="yellow">I wanted to tell you only if I succeeded.</font>

840
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:32,905
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, you'd get all stressed out and take it out on me.</font>

841
00:47:32,945 --> 00:47:34,575
<font color="yellow">I can't put up with that. No way.</font>

842
00:47:35,245 --> 00:47:37,445
<font color="yellow">Well, it's such great news but...</font>

843
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:41,205
<font color="yellow">- it's a bit... - That's enough. I'm exhausted now.</font>

844
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:44,205
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's speak with Ms. Kang in person.</font>

845
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:46,075
<font color="yellow">Gosh, we still have to go through that step.</font>

846
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:50,845
<font color="yellow">Young Bin!</font>

847
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:53,175
<font color="yellow">Where is Turtle?</font>

848
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,445
<font color="yellow">He's been stuck in his room.</font>

849
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:57,145
<font color="yellow">Did you guys have another fight?</font>

850
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:02,645
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - What's happening?</font>

851
00:48:03,745 --> 00:48:05,605
<font color="yellow">You irresponsible jerk.</font>

852
00:48:06,475 --> 00:48:09,045
<font color="yellow">- Get up. - What happened?</font>

853
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:10,975
<font color="yellow">He took off from the set without a word.</font>

854
00:48:11,075 --> 00:48:12,745
<font color="yellow">Did you get a sudden urge to play games?</font>

855
00:48:13,145 --> 00:48:15,475
<font color="yellow">Did you come home to watch porn or what?</font>

856
00:48:15,605 --> 00:48:16,605
<font color="yellow">Turtle.</font>

857
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:19,245
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to do anything.</font>

858
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:21,345
<font color="yellow">Be more specific, will you?</font>

859
00:48:21,405 --> 00:48:22,745
<font color="yellow">Everything was getting on my nerves.</font>

860
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:24,645
<font color="yellow">I get that you don't want to work.</font>

861
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:27,075
<font color="yellow">You're finally doing something after wasting your life away.</font>

862
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:28,575
<font color="yellow">Is it really that hard?</font>

863
00:48:29,905 --> 00:48:31,575
<font color="yellow">I hate you the most because you're so mean.</font>

864
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,745
<font color="yellow">Why are you two being like this?</font>

865
00:48:35,105 --> 00:48:36,745
<font color="yellow">Calm down. Why are you getting so worked up?</font>

866
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:39,605
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's drink together and shake it off. Get up, Turtle.</font>

867
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:42,745
<font color="yellow">Look at him. Doesn't he look like a typical loser?</font>

868
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,305
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

869
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:46,575
<font color="yellow">I felt like a complete loser.</font>

870
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:50,175
<font color="yellow">Everyone else on set has specialized tasks,</font>

871
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:53,145
<font color="yellow">yet I was making instant noodles and delivering coffee for everyone.</font>

872
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:56,375
<font color="yellow">What bothered me the most is how no one talked to me.</font>

873
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:58,375
<font color="yellow">I had no presence there.</font>

874
00:48:59,245 --> 00:49:00,405
<font color="yellow">I thought I was a ghost.</font>

875
00:49:01,445 --> 00:49:02,505
<font color="yellow">Did they think I was a shadow?</font>

876
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:06,675
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, I came home because I felt so pathetic.</font>

877
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:08,475
<font color="yellow">Does that answer your question? Sorry.</font>

878
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:14,275
<font color="yellow">Hey, I can certainly relate to that experience.</font>

879
00:49:14,345 --> 00:49:16,675
<font color="yellow">I went through the same thing when I worked in a film crew.</font>

880
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:20,305
<font color="yellow">And when I was starting out as his manager... This guy was a handful.</font>

881
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,445
<font color="yellow">I also went through that when I used to work as a background actor.</font>

882
00:49:26,975 --> 00:49:28,945
<font color="yellow">Who does he think he is?</font>

883
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:30,605
<font color="yellow">- Joon, stop. - Are you...</font>

884
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:33,205
<font color="yellow">- a hothouse flower or what? - Please.</font>

885
00:49:39,345 --> 00:49:41,605
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Say it again.</font>

886
00:49:44,575 --> 00:49:45,645
<font color="yellow">I said I'm sorry.</font>

887
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,075
<font color="yellow">I did it to toughen you up.</font>

888
00:49:51,245 --> 00:49:52,805
<font color="yellow">People are cold. Everyone is alone after all.</font>

889
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:55,505
<font color="yellow">I wanted to teach you that.</font>

890
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,445
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

891
00:49:59,575 --> 00:50:02,805
<font color="yellow">You need to learn before you teach me.</font>

892
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:04,175
<font color="yellow">All right, I'm sorry.</font>

893
00:50:05,775 --> 00:50:08,145
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the set together tomorrow. I'll go easy on you.</font>

894
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:11,405
<font color="yellow">I'll have to think about it.</font>

895
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,475
<font color="yellow">Also, stop telling me that I'm clueless.</font>

00:50:14,575 --> 00:50:18,275
<font color="yellow">I heard it thousands of times from my teachers. I'm still traumatized.</font>

897
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,745
<font color="yellow">Okay, I won't say it anymore.</font>

898
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:23,505
<font color="yellow">Great. You guys are good now, right?</font>

899
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:27,875
<font color="yellow">Come on. That's it. Everything's been resolved now.</font>

900
00:50:29,075 --> 00:50:30,345
<font color="yellow">You guys are so silly.</font>

901
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:32,305
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji An.</font>

902
00:50:35,705 --> 00:50:36,705
<font color="yellow">"Hey, Ji An."</font>

903
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:39,405
<font color="yellow">What is he doing? His friend is depressed.</font>

904
00:50:39,405 --> 00:50:40,605
<font color="yellow">That betrayer.</font>

905
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,575
<font color="yellow">Is a girl that important to you?</font>

906
00:50:42,675 --> 00:50:44,475
<font color="yellow">I really didn't want to say this.</font>

907
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,375
<font color="yellow">You ugly brats, you two are just the same.</font>

908
00:50:47,475 --> 00:50:49,045
<font color="yellow">You little... Are you serious?</font>

909
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,505
<font color="yellow">You'll regret saying that.</font>

910
00:50:50,675 --> 00:50:51,775
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Hey!</font>

911
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,775
<font color="yellow">Stop there!</font>

912
00:50:58,345 --> 00:51:00,845
<font color="yellow">You were here. What are you doing?</font>

913
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:03,505
<font color="yellow">I'm picking out outfits for Joon's shoot tomorrow.</font>

914
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:05,605
<font color="yellow">I'm supposed to hand them over to his stylist.</font>

915
00:51:05,745 --> 00:51:08,075
<font color="yellow">You really are his manager.</font>

916
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:11,475
<font color="yellow">- Was it hard? - It's embarrassing. Stop now.</font>

917
00:51:12,175 --> 00:51:15,575
<font color="yellow">Everything's hard at first. I've been there.</font>

918
00:51:17,205 --> 00:51:18,805
<font color="yellow">I'll work really hard from tomorrow.</font>

919
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:21,475
<font color="yellow">- Is Ho Jin asleep? - He passed out.</font>

920
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:24,675
<font color="yellow">He's working so hard to get me that movie.</font>

921
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:27,975
<font color="yellow">He's already asked around about who will produce the movie.</font>

922
00:51:29,005 --> 00:51:31,545
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin is the real manager.</font>

923
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:35,075
<font color="yellow">He is, but don't say that to him. He'll get stuck up.</font>

924
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:39,975
<font color="yellow">On my first day at work, I only caused trouble.</font>

925
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:42,545
<font color="yellow">You're lucky to have Ho Jin and Mr. Kim.</font>

926
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,105
<font color="yellow">Right. Mr. Kim is not with you anymore.</font>

927
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:48,175
<font color="yellow">You said that on purpose, right?</font>

928
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,745
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't. I'm not Ho Jin.</font>

929
00:51:52,645 --> 00:51:54,205
<font color="yellow">I'm going to hold hands with Ms. Kang.</font>

930
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:57,975
<font color="yellow">Well, all right.</font>

931
00:52:00,545 --> 00:52:02,875
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd quit right away. You've grown up.</font>

932
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:05,305
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, I'm more mature than you.</font>

933
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,575
<font color="yellow">What? I have a job and used to have a girlfriend.</font>

934
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,405
<font color="yellow">Do you have to touch your friend's sore spot?</font>

935
00:52:11,945 --> 00:52:12,945
<font color="yellow">It's bleeding.</font>

936
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:16,275

937
00:52:16,405 --> 00:52:18,145
<font color="yellow">Joon is working early tomorrow.</font>

938
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:20,045
<font color="yellow">Let's just have 40 cans. Here.</font>

939
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,905
<font color="yellow">- Let's have 50. - I can't do that.</font>

940
00:52:26,845 --> 00:52:27,845
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms. Kang.</font>

941
00:52:28,945 --> 00:52:31,105
<font color="yellow">The production company will buy the rights,</font>

942
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:32,575
<font color="yellow">so I think I'll be able to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

943
00:52:32,945 --> 00:52:34,205
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

944
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,545
<font color="yellow">I'd like to talk to you in person.</font>

945
00:52:36,645 --> 00:52:37,905
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

946
00:52:38,675 --> 00:52:41,675
<font color="yellow">you'd rather do that movie than the Chinese drama?</font>

947
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:44,845
<font color="yellow">- Yes. I'll tell you in person. - I can't meet today.</font>

948
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:47,645
<font color="yellow">I'm out of town today.</font>

949
00:52:48,405 --> 00:52:49,445
<font color="yellow">You are?</font>

950
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:51,675
<font color="yellow">When could we...</font>

951
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:53,605
<font color="yellow">Let's talk in a few days.</font>

952
00:52:54,445 --> 00:52:57,875
<font color="yellow">The situation might change by then. Let's talk again.</font>

953
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:00,345
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

954
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:05,475
<font color="yellow">I sent the contract by email to Manager Lee.</font>

955
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:07,545
<font color="yellow">Check with him.</font>

956
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:10,645
<font color="yellow">- It'll make you feel good. - Okay, I'll do that.</font>

957
00:53:10,945 --> 00:53:13,805
<font color="yellow">Is the film company owned by Mr. Ahn?</font>

958
00:53:13,945 --> 00:53:15,045
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

959
00:53:15,305 --> 00:53:18,605
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back. Check the contract first.</font>

960
00:53:18,745 --> 00:53:19,745
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

961
00:53:27,175 --> 00:53:29,945
<font color="yellow">Who had Chinese food in the office?</font>

962
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:32,375
<font color="yellow">The whole office stinks.</font>

963
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:34,105
<font color="yellow">Eat somewhere else!</font>

964
00:53:37,205 --> 00:53:39,175
<font color="yellow">- Has the contract arrived? - Yes, it just came.</font>

965
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:42,945
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

966
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:46,675
<font color="yellow">(Section 5: Sharing the Profits)</font>

967
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:49,275
<font color="yellow">Are they offering that much down payment?</font>

968
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:52,275
<font color="yellow">It's twice the amount Ms. Kang said last time.</font>

969
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:54,145
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

970
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:58,105
<font color="yellow">She's determined to make you sign the contract.</font>

971
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:06,275
<font color="yellow">The lunch break was a long time ago.</font>

972
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:10,905
<font color="yellow">After eating delivery food, put the plates somewhere hidden.</font>

973
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:14,005
<font color="yellow">They were at the door. I stained my clothes while moving them.</font>

974
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:16,045
<font color="yellow">Give me wet wipes.</font>

975
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:20,475
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

976
00:54:25,475 --> 00:54:26,475
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Ahn.</font>

977
00:54:28,105 --> 00:54:29,105
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

978
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:39,945
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

979
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:44,945
<font color="yellow">Things have become so difficult.</font>

980
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:48,575
<font color="yellow">I miss the old days.</font>

981
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:50,605
<font color="yellow">I see you have company.</font>

982
00:54:51,545 --> 00:54:52,575
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

983
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:54,575
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

984
00:54:55,475 --> 00:54:58,375
<font color="yellow">I'd love to have a little drink.</font>

985
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:00,575
<font color="yellow">Scoot over.</font>

986
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:03,775
<font color="yellow">I'll pour you one.</font>

987
00:55:07,445 --> 00:55:08,445
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

988
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:13,845
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ahn and I haven't met in a while.</font>

989
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:17,245
<font color="yellow">- We did a little catching up. - I see.</font>

990
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:20,905
<font color="yellow">We're among the few old people left.</font>

991
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:26,075
<font color="yellow">This field is full of those still wet behind the ears now.</font>

992
00:55:26,175 --> 00:55:29,105
<font color="yellow">Then get a coffin and chill out at home.</font>

993
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:31,575
<font color="yellow">Watch your language in front of your senior.</font>

994
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:32,775
<font color="yellow">Leave him alone.</font>

995
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,345
<font color="yellow">I should have taught him a lesson a long time ago.</font>

996
00:55:36,205 --> 00:55:37,705
<font color="yellow">He's so stubborn,</font>

997
00:55:38,145 --> 00:55:40,775
<font color="yellow">and he thinks he now has his own head.</font>

998
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,375
<font color="yellow">I've always had my own head.</font>

999
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:49,545
<font color="yellow">You used to be so big.</font>

1000
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:52,845
<font color="yellow">You always had two portions of cup noodles.</font>

1001
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,775
<font color="yellow">If I remember correctly,</font>

1002
00:55:54,775 --> 00:55:56,745
<font color="yellow">you had three portions.</font>

1003
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:57,845
<font color="yellow">- What? - That's right.</font>

1004
00:55:58,075 --> 00:55:59,645
<font color="yellow">I've seen you doing that.</font>

1005
00:55:59,745 --> 00:56:01,975
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure it was 2 portions. - It was 3.</font>

1006
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,745
<font color="yellow">When we went to karaoke,</font>

1007
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:05,275
<font color="yellow">you always mimicked Jung Won Kwan.</font>

1008
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:06,905
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

1009
00:56:08,205 --> 00:56:10,305
<font color="yellow">Please forget it.</font>

1010
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:12,945
<font color="yellow">That was such a long time ago.</font>

1011
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:14,445
<font color="yellow">It's getting hot.</font>

1012
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:17,275
<font color="yellow">Jung Won Kwan has lost weight unlike a certain someone.</font>

1013
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:19,945
<font color="yellow">Let's stop talking about the past.</font>

1014
00:56:20,145 --> 00:56:22,445
<font color="yellow">Say what you have to say. I know you two are up to something.</font>

1015
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,775
<font color="yellow">What is it? Spit it out.</font>

1016
00:56:24,345 --> 00:56:25,575
<font color="yellow">You catch on fast.</font>

1017
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,205
<font color="yellow">You're so good at ruining others' plans...</font>

1018
00:56:29,305 --> 00:56:31,945
<font color="yellow">and pushing ahead with yours. You haven't changed.</font>

1019
00:56:32,045 --> 00:56:35,045
<font color="yellow">You even got Mr. Ahn involved behind my back.</font>

1020
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:36,975
<font color="yellow">That was fast.</font>

1021
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:38,905
<font color="yellow">I almost got tricked.</font>

1022
00:56:39,245 --> 00:56:40,475
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

1023
00:56:40,645 --> 00:56:43,645
<font color="yellow">I was just helping Young Bin get a role.</font>

1024
00:56:43,805 --> 00:56:44,905
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

1025
00:56:45,505 --> 00:56:48,405
<font color="yellow">You wanted to win his heart by helping him.</font>

1026
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:52,045
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is...</font>

1027
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:54,245
<font color="yellow">not going to do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

1028
00:56:57,775 --> 00:57:00,505
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

1029
00:57:00,675 --> 00:57:02,975
<font color="yellow">You sounded like you were working with him.</font>

1030
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:06,575
<font color="yellow">He's going to make a contract with her.</font>

1031
00:57:06,645 --> 00:57:09,675
<font color="yellow">And she's not going to let him do "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

1032
00:57:10,505 --> 00:57:11,645
<font color="yellow">Who will do "Lim Hwa Su", then?</font>

1033
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:14,075
<font color="yellow">I'll introduce a top actor.</font>

1034
00:57:15,045 --> 00:57:16,775
<font color="yellow">They can do it with another actor.</font>

1035
00:57:17,645 --> 00:57:18,645
<font color="yellow">That sounds good.</font>

1036
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:23,505
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Do you want to help me, too?</font>

1037
00:57:23,975 --> 00:57:26,575
<font color="yellow">I'll leave the old people alone.</font>

1038
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,505
<font color="yellow">I've sent him a contract, too.</font>

1039
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,375
<font color="yellow">The down payment will be double the original amount.</font>

1040
00:57:34,505 --> 00:57:35,875
<font color="yellow">That much?</font>

1041
00:57:36,045 --> 00:57:39,375
<font color="yellow">I take it seriously. He's worth it, too.</font>

1042
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,345
<font color="yellow">In addition to the down payment, if he appears on the Chinese drama,</font>

1043
00:57:44,405 --> 00:57:48,345
<font color="yellow">he'll start making some money. That's a good thing, right?</font>

1044
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,175
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

1045
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,575
<font color="yellow">Now,</font>

1046
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:02,575
<font color="yellow">get your hands off of him.</font>

1047
00:58:06,205 --> 00:58:07,345
<font color="yellow">Please take good care of him.</font>

1048
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:19,275
<font color="yellow">- This way. - Thank you.</font>

1049
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:23,275
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

1050
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,705
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you.</font>

1051
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:27,845
<font color="yellow">She needs a little break.</font>

1052
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:28,975
<font color="yellow">Give her a little break, please.</font>

1053
00:58:30,105 --> 00:58:31,275
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

1054
00:58:33,405 --> 00:58:36,175
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for today. - Thank you.</font>

1055
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:38,045
<font color="yellow">I had a lot of fun.</font>

1056
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:40,975
<font color="yellow">- See you. - See you.</font>

1057
00:58:41,345 --> 00:58:42,345
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

1058
00:58:43,805 --> 00:58:46,245
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today. Drink some water.</font>

1059
00:58:46,445 --> 00:58:48,545
<font color="yellow">She's an angel.</font>

1060
00:58:50,045 --> 00:58:51,045
<font color="yellow">She's so cute.</font>

1061
00:58:51,545 --> 00:58:53,875
<font color="yellow">She's prettier in real life. Are we done now?</font>

1062
00:58:53,975 --> 00:58:57,875
<font color="yellow">There's just a short interview left.</font>

1063
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:01,005
<font color="yellow">They'll ask me how it was to be her manager.</font>

1064
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:03,305
<font color="yellow">I'll only say good things about her.</font>

1065
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,045
<font color="yellow">Hey, I heard it's her birthday tomorrow.</font>

1066
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,775
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we prepare a cake?</font>

1067
00:59:11,445 --> 00:59:14,075
<font color="yellow">- A cake? Right now? - Can you get one?</font>

1068
00:59:14,445 --> 00:59:17,105
<font color="yellow">- Buy a nice one. - All right.</font>

1069
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:19,845
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me. - What do you mean?</font>

1070
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:23,275
<font color="yellow">Your credit card. I lost all my money to the girl in Jeju Island.</font>

1071
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,605
<font color="yellow">- I'm broke. - Gosh.</font>

1072
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,245
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

1073
00:59:28,945 --> 00:59:29,975
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

1074
00:59:32,545 --> 00:59:34,045
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what are you doing?</font>

1075
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:35,345
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

1076
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:40,075
<font color="yellow">What's with you?</font>

1077
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:46,475
<font color="yellow">Why did it take so long?</font>

1078
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:48,805
<font color="yellow">There was no bakery around here.</font>

1079
00:59:49,245 --> 00:59:50,275
<font color="yellow">Where's my card?</font>

1080
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,275
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Give me the receipt.</font>

1081
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,445
<font color="yellow">(56 dollars)</font>

1082
00:59:58,545 --> 01:00:01,075
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? It's too expensive.</font>

1083
01:00:01,975 --> 01:00:05,005
<font color="yellow">It's for Geun Young.</font>

1084
01:00:05,075 --> 01:00:08,645
<font color="yellow">Still, you could have bought something cheaper.</font>

1085
01:00:09,345 --> 01:00:10,945
<font color="yellow">I'll take 30 dollars off your salary next month.</font>

1086
01:00:11,175 --> 01:00:13,745
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Let me see the cake.</font>

1087
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,205
<font color="yellow">Gosh. When are we eating? I'm starving.</font>

1088
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:17,845
<font color="yellow">I ate while you were away.</font>

1089
01:00:17,945 --> 01:00:20,705
<font color="yellow">- Darn it. - Take the cake out.</font>

1090
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:24,275
<font color="yellow">It's so annoying.</font>

1091
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:27,575
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

1092
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,905
<font color="yellow">Why did you stick your hand in there?</font>

1093
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:31,705
<font color="yellow">Can't you even do this?</font>

1094
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:35,305
<font color="yellow">How can you be so stupid?</font>

1095
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:38,905
<font color="yellow">- This way. - Why does he want to see me?</font>

1096
01:00:39,105 --> 01:00:40,745
<font color="yellow">- She's here. Take this. - I'm not sure.</font>

1097
01:00:46,845 --> 01:00:48,305
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

1098
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:52,505
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday, dear Geun Young</font>

1099
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:56,305
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you</font>

1100
01:00:56,705 --> 01:00:58,205
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

1101
01:00:59,545 --> 01:01:00,605
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1102
01:01:01,775 --> 01:01:04,605
<font color="yellow">The stupid brat bought such a tasty cake.</font>

1103
01:01:04,905 --> 01:01:06,545
<font color="yellow">What? Do you want some?</font>

1104
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:08,605
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you jerk.</font>

1105
01:01:09,645 --> 01:01:10,705
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

1106
01:01:11,175 --> 01:01:12,245
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

1107
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:16,945
<font color="yellow">Happy birthday to you.</font>

1108
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,375
<font color="yellow">That punk.</font>

1109
01:01:29,445 --> 01:01:30,505
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

1110
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:37,545
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

1111
01:01:38,605 --> 01:01:39,645
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

1112
01:01:40,575 --> 01:01:41,845
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

1113
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:45,405
<font color="yellow">You're out. You're fired.</font>

1114
01:01:45,475 --> 01:01:48,575
<font color="yellow">I'm out? Are we playing baseball? I didn't want to do it anyway.</font>

1115
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:50,705
<font color="yellow">You won't be able to work in this field again.</font>

1116
01:01:50,775 --> 01:01:52,475
<font color="yellow">I've never wanted to.</font>

1117
01:01:53,345 --> 01:01:54,345
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

1118
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:57,205
<font color="yellow">I won't cook for you anymore. Clean your room yourself.</font>

1119
01:01:57,545 --> 01:01:59,575
<font color="yellow">Young Bin is my cousin. Get out of his house.</font>

1120
01:01:59,775 --> 01:02:01,775
<font color="yellow">Get lost, you idiot!</font>

1121
01:02:03,175 --> 01:02:04,745
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

1122
01:02:05,075 --> 01:02:07,105
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hang out with you anymore, either!</font>

1123
01:02:11,405 --> 01:02:13,105
<font color="yellow">Let me give you a new nickname.</font>

1124
01:02:14,005 --> 01:02:15,645
<font color="yellow">What about Mr. Prostate?</font>

1125
01:02:15,905 --> 01:02:17,475
<font color="yellow">Look who's standing behind you.</font>

1126
01:02:17,605 --> 01:02:19,275
<font color="yellow">You got a new nickname in front of her.</font>

1127
01:02:19,345 --> 01:02:21,545
<font color="yellow">This is a historic moment.</font>

1128
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:23,575
<font color="yellow">What's with him?</font>

1129
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,575
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

1130
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:29,305
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop right there, you punk!</font>

1131
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:31,975
<font color="yellow">- Stop her! - Geun Young!</font>

1132
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:36,545
<font color="yellow">Why are they delivering the contract in the parking lot?</font>

1133
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:37,575
<font color="yellow">I have no idea.</font>

1134
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:41,475
<font color="yellow">- What's that? - What's going on?</font>

1135
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:45,275
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the bread guy?</font>

1136
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:47,905
<font color="yellow">He is.</font>

1137
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:49,805
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

1138
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:52,175
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

1139
01:02:54,745 --> 01:02:56,345
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

1140
01:02:56,505 --> 01:02:58,575
<font color="yellow">Did you get a new car?</font>

1141
01:02:58,805 --> 01:02:59,805
<font color="yellow">It looks amazing.</font>

1142
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:03,245
<font color="yellow">Here's the contract signed by Ms. Kang.</font>

1143
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:05,445
<font color="yellow">Please sign it and send it to the office.</font>

1144
01:03:05,475 --> 01:03:06,475
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1145
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:10,245
<font color="yellow">Also, here's a present from Ms. Kang.</font>

1146
01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:12,175
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Sorry?</font>

1147
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:13,745
<font color="yellow">Check your contract.</font>

1148
01:03:13,845 --> 01:03:16,705
<font color="yellow">It says, "Down payment plus some extra benefits".</font>

1149
01:03:17,075 --> 01:03:18,945
<font color="yellow">Is this...</font>

1150
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,145
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

1151
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,275
<font color="yellow">- I'll get going then. - Okay.</font>

1152
01:03:27,475 --> 01:03:29,145
<font color="yellow">- See you. - Are you leaving it here?</font>

1153
01:03:29,775 --> 01:03:30,775
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

1154
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:33,375
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

1155
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:37,105
<font color="yellow">She's almost forcing you to sign the contract.</font>

1156
01:03:37,675 --> 01:03:40,445
<font color="yellow">I think she's overestimating you.</font>

1157
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:41,775
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

1158
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:44,705
<font color="yellow">This is really nice but...</font>

1159
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:46,675
<font color="yellow">But?</font>

1160
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:50,445
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

1161
01:03:50,545 --> 01:03:51,545
<font color="yellow">(Ms. Kang Ok Ja)</font>

1162
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:53,575
<font color="yellow">- It's Ms. Kang. - Answer it.</font>

1163
01:03:54,475 --> 01:03:55,875
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hi.</font>

1164
01:03:56,475 --> 01:03:57,675
<font color="yellow">Did you get the present?</font>

1165
01:03:57,675 --> 01:04:00,075
<font color="yellow">Yes, we just did.</font>

1166
01:04:00,775 --> 01:04:02,875
<font color="yellow">Is Young Bin there? Can you put him on, too?</font>

1167
01:04:03,245 --> 01:04:04,245
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1168
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:08,405
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ms. Kang.</font>

1169
01:04:09,275 --> 01:04:12,445
<font color="yellow">I have some updates on "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

1170
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:13,545
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1171
01:04:14,275 --> 01:04:16,975
<font color="yellow">I think someone else will do it.</font>

1172
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:20,105
<font color="yellow">Wait. Did Mr. Ahn say that?</font>

1173
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:22,005
<font color="yellow">Yes, I met him.</font>

1174
01:04:22,545 --> 01:04:25,505
<font color="yellow">He did consider Young Bin, but then he changed his mind.</font>

1175
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:27,775
<font color="yellow">That's... But I met him...</font>

1176
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,505
<font color="yellow">I'll explain tomorrow.</font>

1177
01:04:30,305 --> 01:04:31,575
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you this.</font>

1178
01:04:32,205 --> 01:04:34,575
<font color="yellow">You can start on the Chinese drama right away.</font>

1179
01:04:35,575 --> 01:04:37,005
<font color="yellow">Enjoy my present today.</font>

1180
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:41,205
<font color="yellow">I'll be looking forward to good news tomorrow.</font>

1181
01:04:41,505 --> 01:04:42,575
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

1182
01:04:45,575 --> 01:04:47,075
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm getting a headache.</font>

1183
01:04:48,345 --> 01:04:50,845
<font color="yellow">- What happened? - Let's try the car.</font>

1184
01:05:15,005 --> 01:05:16,705
<font color="yellow">This is nice indeed.</font>

1185
01:05:18,075 --> 01:05:20,445
<font color="yellow">It must be extremely expensive. It makes me nervous.</font>

1186
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:21,775
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

1187
01:05:22,105 --> 01:05:24,945
<font color="yellow">I don't even like driving. She didn't have to buy me this.</font>

1188
01:05:26,975 --> 01:05:28,175
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

1189
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:31,745
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

1190
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:34,775
<font color="yellow">Am I really not doing "Lim Hwa Su"?</font>

1191
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:40,075
<font color="yellow">I don't know what happened. Mr. Ahn said you could do it.</font>

1192
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,175
<font color="yellow">You met him, right?</font>

1193
01:05:42,775 --> 01:05:43,975
<font color="yellow">Yes, we met him.</font>

1194
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:47,305
<font color="yellow">"We"? Were you with someone?</font>

1195
01:05:48,305 --> 01:05:49,375
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim.</font>

1196
01:05:51,945 --> 01:05:53,875
<font color="yellow">- It's just... - Why didn't you tell me?</font>

1197
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:56,245
<font color="yellow">He was with me.</font>

1198
01:06:29,805 --> 01:06:31,905
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Me?</font>

1199
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:35,205
<font color="yellow">- You're making that face again. - What do you mean?</font>

1200
01:06:35,745 --> 01:06:37,175
<font color="yellow">I think I should call the pastor again.</font>

1201
01:06:37,945 --> 01:06:40,605
<font color="yellow">No, no. That's not it.</font>

1202
01:06:58,975 --> 01:07:00,145
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr. Kim.</font>

1203
01:07:09,475 --> 01:07:11,845
<font color="yellow">- Young Bin. - Have you been well?</font>

1204
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:19,345
<font color="yellow">Yes, I've been working and pooping.</font>

1205
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:21,775
<font color="yellow">- As always. - You haven't changed.</font>

1206
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:25,705
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

1207
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,345
<font color="yellow">Young Bin has something to tell you.</font>

1208
01:07:29,475 --> 01:07:30,675
<font color="yellow">He does? What is it?</font>

1209
01:07:32,945 --> 01:07:34,745
<font color="yellow">- Tell him. - Go ahead.</font>

1210
01:07:37,075 --> 01:07:38,475
<font color="yellow">I heard you tried to get me on "Lim Hwa Su".</font>

1211
01:07:40,075 --> 01:07:41,075
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

1212
01:07:41,745 --> 01:07:44,245
<font color="yellow">Manager Lee did most of it. I just tagged along.</font>

1213
01:07:44,345 --> 01:07:45,375
<font color="yellow">I heard everything.</font>

1214
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:48,575
<font color="yellow">Despite your effort, I lost the role.</font>

1215
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:52,345
<font color="yellow">Did Ms. Kang not approve?</font>

1216
01:07:52,345 --> 01:07:55,915
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ahn chose another actor.</font>

1217
01:07:58,345 --> 01:08:00,075
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1218
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:03,575
<font color="yellow">I was feeling depressed,</font>

1219
01:08:03,675 --> 01:08:05,005
<font color="yellow">so I came to see you with this car.</font>

1220
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,775
<font color="yellow">Is it from Ms. Kang?</font>

1221
01:08:09,245 --> 01:08:10,805
<font color="yellow">She must have spent a fortune.</font>

1222
01:08:12,775 --> 01:08:13,915
<font color="yellow">But I can't have it.</font>

1223
01:08:15,575 --> 01:08:16,605
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

1224
01:08:17,775 --> 01:08:19,175
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work with you.</font>

1225
01:08:21,775 --> 01:08:22,805
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1226
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:25,915
<font color="yellow">- Is he using drugs? - That's absurd.</font>

1227
01:08:25,975 --> 01:08:27,105
<font color="yellow">Or is he drinking a lot?</font>

1228
01:08:28,045 --> 01:08:29,075
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

1229
01:08:34,645 --> 01:08:35,875
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

1230
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,875
<font color="yellow">Yes, I've been regretting my decision.</font>

1231
01:08:40,475 --> 01:08:43,975
<font color="yellow">I also feel indebted to you for helping me.</font>

1232
01:08:44,105 --> 01:08:47,275
<font color="yellow">Ho Jin has been nagging me to work with you, too.</font>

1233
01:08:48,245 --> 01:08:51,275
<font color="yellow">He's a smart boy. He'll become successful.</font>

1234
01:08:51,345 --> 01:08:53,205
<font color="yellow">He's not Cup Noodles anymore.</font>

1235
01:08:53,305 --> 01:08:55,075
<font color="yellow">He's the King of Cup Noodles now.</font>

1236
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:57,975
<font color="yellow">What's so funny?</font>

1237
01:08:57,975 --> 01:09:00,175
<font color="yellow">It's just a little bit funny.</font>

1238
01:09:00,445 --> 01:09:02,845
<font color="yellow">Just as little as Hee Dong's.</font>

1239
01:09:03,275 --> 01:09:04,445
<font color="yellow">Who's Hee Dong?</font>

1240
01:09:04,545 --> 01:09:06,605
<font color="yellow">He's my old friend. His thing is this small.</font>

1241
01:09:07,945 --> 01:09:09,345
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What are you talking about?</font>

1242
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:10,915
<font color="yellow">This is so funny.</font>

1243
01:09:12,045 --> 01:09:15,075
<font color="yellow">Let me see. What are you going to do with this car?</font>

1244
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:17,675
<font color="yellow">I should return it.</font>

1245
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:20,775
<font color="yellow">Should we have some fun with it before that?</font>

1246
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:24,175
<font color="yellow">Can I drive?</font>

1247
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:25,475
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

1248
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:28,775
<font color="yellow">I'll give it some scratches. Get in.</font>

1249
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:29,775
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

1250
01:09:30,175 --> 01:09:32,975
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Look at this.</font>

1251
01:09:39,805 --> 01:09:41,575
<font color="yellow">- It's fantastic. - It's nice, right?</font>

1252
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:43,915
<font color="yellow">This is what a car should be like.</font>

1253
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:46,505
<font color="yellow">- Can't you buy me one of these? - Are you kidding me?</font>

1254
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,415
<font color="yellow">My foot is barely on, but it goes so fast.</font>

1255
01:09:49,415 --> 01:09:50,475
<font color="yellow">It's amazing.</font>

1256
01:09:51,545 --> 01:09:54,445
<font color="yellow">- It's nice. - You look happy.</font>

1257
01:09:54,575 --> 01:09:57,275
<font color="yellow">Of course. We're back together.</font>

1258
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:20,875
<font color="yellow">(Entourage)</font>

1259
01:10:21,575 --> 01:10:23,345
<font color="yellow">We're not here to butter up the director.</font>

1260
01:10:23,445 --> 01:10:25,175
<font color="yellow">We want to see if we like the director.</font>

1261
01:10:26,575 --> 01:10:28,345
<font color="yellow">We don't need you two here.</font>

1262
01:10:28,415 --> 01:10:29,675
<font color="yellow">Young Bin, come alone next time.</font>

1263
01:10:29,675 --> 01:10:30,675
<font color="yellow">He's crazy.</font>

1264
01:10:30,675 --> 01:10:34,045
<font color="yellow">I was so touched by your works.</font>

1265
01:10:34,775 --> 01:10:36,245
<font color="yellow">What is this place?</font>

1266
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,375
<font color="yellow">Come out!</font>

1267
01:10:37,915 --> 01:10:38,975
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

1268
01:10:39,145 --> 01:10:42,145
<font color="yellow">Since he started working for the actress, he's been ignoring us.</font>

1269
01:10:42,575 --> 01:10:44,305
<font color="yellow">That crazy brat caused another problem.</font>

1270
01:10:44,415 --> 01:10:46,345
<font color="yellow">The main character is a girl, not you.</font>

1271
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:47,545
<font color="yellow">We should tell them.</font>

1272
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:49,745
<font color="yellow">I'll tell them to stick to the original version.</font>
