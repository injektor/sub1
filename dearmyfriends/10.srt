1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,310
<font color="yellow">Why did she have to go?</font>

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,420
<font color="yellow">I don't know she wouldn't say</font>

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,720
<font color="yellow">I said</font>

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,980
<font color="yellow">Something wrong now I long</font>

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,120
<font color="yellow">For yesterday</font>

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,930
<font color="yellow">Yesterday</font>

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,470
<font color="yellow">Love was such an easy game to play</font>

8
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,660
<font color="yellow">Now I need a place to hide away</font>

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,320
<font color="yellow">Oh, I believe in yesterday</font>

10
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,590
<font color="yellow">You're good.</font>

11
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,490
<font color="yellow">I practised it a hundred times,</font>

12
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,490
<font color="yellow">but it's hard to learn at my age.</font>

13
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,320
<font color="yellow">Are you married?</font>

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,020
<font color="yellow">I was widowed five years ago.</font>

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,060
<font color="yellow">I have a son who is in university.</font>

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,120
<font color="yellow">I was widowed, too.</font>

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,860
<font color="yellow">It happened long time ago.</font>

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,660
<font color="yellow">I'm alone now.</font>

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,720
<font color="yellow">I have a daughter who's almost 40 years old.</font>

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,890
<font color="yellow">Right. I have my parents and a brother, too.</font>

21
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,990
<font color="yellow">I'm not alone, I guess.</font>

22
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,190
<font color="yellow">The street lamps</font>

23
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,590
<font color="yellow">On the alleyways</font>

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,260
<font color="yellow">Are turning on one by one</font>

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,990
<font color="yellow">Beyond the scarlet sunset</font>

26
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,660
<font color="yellow">The day has gone by again</font>

27
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,690
<font color="yellow">Everything feels like it was a dream</font>

28
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,190
<font color="yellow">I miss you so</font>

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,230
<font color="yellow">Just the way you were</font>

30
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,260
<font color="yellow">As if nothing</font>

31
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,560
<font color="yellow">Ever happened at all</font>

32
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,660
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

33
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,620
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, your card!</font>

34
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,090
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- No problem.</font>

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,890
<font color="yellow">Are there any tickets left?</font>

36
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,890
<font color="yellow">I really have to go.</font>

37
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,320
<font color="yellow">We only have business seats left.</font>

38
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,960
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

39
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
<font color="yellow">I'll take it.</font>

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,940
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Did I tell you that...</font>

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="yellow">Jeong A is getting a divorce?</font>

42
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,060
<font color="yellow">- You did.
- What do you think about it?</font>

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,070
<font color="yellow">I think she's finally taking her revenge.</font>

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,590
<font color="yellow">I don't think she'll actually do it.</font>

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,760
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,320
<font color="yellow">She already found a new place.</font>

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,690
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun doesn't know about it.</font>

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,960
<font color="yellow">We're going over to clean the place tomorrow.</font>

49
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,950
<font color="yellow">- Come with me.
- Not again.</font>

50
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,170
<font color="yellow">Don't make me regret making up with you.</font>

51
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,420
<font color="yellow">Just date a guy instead.</font>

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,830
<font color="yellow">Don't be so obsessed with me.</font>

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,430
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

54
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,770
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,030
<font color="yellow">What else should we take to help her clean?</font>

56
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,730
<font color="yellow">I guess you and Wan talked it out.</font>

57
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,800
<font color="yellow">It was a misunderstanding about Dong Jin.</font>

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,470
<font color="yellow">Now, I'm the only crazy one.</font>

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,270
<font color="yellow">It's her fault for making you misunderstand. It's not your fault.</font>

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,590
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it feels good to pull out her hair.</font>

61
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,630
<font color="yellow">She screamed and told me that she hated me.</font>

62
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,000
<font color="yellow">She probably only said it out of spite, right?</font>

63
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,300
<font color="yellow">Well, it's not like I adore her all the time either.</font>

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,070
<font color="yellow">I guess it's the same.</font>

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,600
<font color="yellow">Contrary to what most mums think,</font>

66
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,570
<font color="yellow">kids usually hate their mums.</font>

67
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,630
<font color="yellow">I like my mum.</font>

68
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,870
<font color="yellow">That's because you got older. You weren't like that before.</font>

69
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,600
<font color="yellow">That's true. Mum was a nightmare.</font>

70
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,870
<font color="yellow">There is no truce between a mother and a child...</font>

71
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:37,270
<font color="yellow">until you're on your deathbed.</font>

72
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,800
<font color="yellow">When you're about to die, Wan will love you a lot.</font>

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,770
<font color="yellow">She might even cry her eyes out.</font>

74
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,770
<font color="yellow">Let's look forward to that day.</font>

75
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,230
<font color="yellow">If anyone wants to be loved by their kid, I guess they should die.</font>

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,380
<font color="yellow">Hey, Choong Nam. Should I start dating?</font>

77
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,490
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to ask.</font>

78
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,070
<font color="yellow">There's a guy, you know?</font>

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,170
<font color="yellow">He's 10 years younger.</font>

80
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,780
<font color="yellow">I've been just eyeing him.</font>

81
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,000
<font color="yellow">I think he's quite all right.</font>

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

83
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,740
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

84
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,540
<font color="yellow">Here, you didn't even have dinner.</font>

85
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,400
<font color="yellow">Fill yourself up with this.</font>

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,630
<font color="yellow">Be careful, it's hot.</font>

87
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,500
<font color="yellow">I wish it rained more.</font>

88
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,170
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

89
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,500
<font color="yellow">I wish it would rain more.</font>

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
<font color="yellow">It's just drizzling.</font>

91
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,130
<font color="yellow">I wish it would rain...</font>

92
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,170
<font color="yellow">like cats and dogs...</font>

93
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,030
<font color="yellow">so that the two of us are stuck here.</font>

94
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,590
<font color="yellow">I want to be stuck here for three months...</font>

95
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,330
<font color="yellow">and just stay with you.</font>

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
<font color="yellow">It's hot.</font>

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,400
<font color="yellow">Eat or talk. Just do one at a time.</font>

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,130
<font color="yellow">Why are you so rushed?</font>

99
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,530
<font color="yellow">It's because I like you.</font>

100
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,630
<font color="yellow">It must be good to like me.</font>

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,800
<font color="yellow">I don't like or hate anything now that I'm old.</font>

103
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

104
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,900
<font color="yellow">You have some on you.</font>

105
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
<font color="yellow">It's off.</font>

106
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,870
<font color="yellow">You have some, too.</font>

107
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,870
<font color="yellow">Back then,</font>

108
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,630
<font color="yellow">we were doing something like this...</font>

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,700
<font color="yellow">before we kissed.</font>

110
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,300
<font color="yellow">I did the same thing with my late husband.</font>

111
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,130
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to break the mood?</font>

112
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,070
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to mention him?</font>

113
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,200
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring him up?</font>

114
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,070
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Are you going to sleep there?</font>

115
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,070
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to share a room with me,</font>

116
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,200
<font color="yellow">go to that chilly room and sleep.</font>

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,770
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Here.</font>

118
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,500
<font color="yellow">If I go over the line...</font>

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,170
<font color="yellow">I'll bring the axe from outside...</font>

120
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,570
<font color="yellow">and cut you.</font>

121
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,600
<font color="yellow">Your husband, Jung Cheol...</font>

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,830
<font color="yellow">What was he like to you?</font>

123
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,770
<font color="yellow">Other than cheating on me once, he was a good man.</font>

124
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,070
<font color="yellow">I guess he didn't cheat on you more than once.</font>

125
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,600
<font color="yellow">Are there such people?</font>

126
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,890
<font color="yellow">Are you one of them?</font>

127
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,030
<font color="yellow">No. I'm the type that women fell for.</font>

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
<font color="yellow">I wasn't like that.</font>

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,100
<font color="yellow">What was your wife like?</font>

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,470
<font color="yellow">She was beautiful.</font>

131
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,280
<font color="yellow">Tell me more. What was she like?</font>

132
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,770
<font color="yellow">I just told you. She was beautiful.</font>

133
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,770
<font color="yellow">She was a little sensitive,</font>

134
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,030
<font color="yellow">but it wasn't a big deal.</font>

135
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,330
<font color="yellow">I heard you quit your job for three years...</font>

136
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,500
<font color="yellow">to take care of her when she was sick.</font>

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

138
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,200
<font color="yellow">I loved those three years.</font>

139
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,970
<font color="yellow">I used to love whistling, just like you.</font>

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,600
<font color="yellow">If you're trying to charm me with your whistling,</font>

141
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,780
<font color="yellow">she can here you from up there.</font>

142
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,970
<font color="yellow">She would be cheering me on.</font>

143
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,300
<font color="yellow">She'd think I made a nice new friend.</font>

144
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,800
<font color="yellow">You wish.</font>

145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
<font color="yellow">What is it? Do you think your husband wouldn't like it?</font>

146
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,140
<font color="yellow">Were you good to her?</font>

147
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,970
<font color="yellow">Only after she got sick.</font>

148
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,230
<font color="yellow">I didn't care about her much before then.</font>

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,670
<font color="yellow">Husbands...</font>

150
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,970
<font color="yellow">grow up when their wives get sick.</font>

151
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,930
<font color="yellow">What morons.</font>

152
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,930
<font color="yellow">When was...</font>

153
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,030
<font color="yellow">the happiest day in your life?</font>

154
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:13,470
<font color="yellow">The day my eldest was born.</font>

155
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,570
<font color="yellow">When was the saddest day then?</font>

156
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,930
<font color="yellow">When my eldest died.</font>

157
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,770
<font color="yellow">Min Ho's my second son.</font>

158
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,730
<font color="yellow">It was just a fever.</font>

159
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,140
<font color="yellow">We lived near my husband's home town.</font>

160
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,770
<font color="yellow">He was on a business trip,</font>

161
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,070
<font color="yellow">so I carried our son all the way to the hospital.</font>

162
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,930
<font color="yellow">But they said...</font>

163
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,930
<font color="yellow">he was already dead.</font>

164
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,770
<font color="yellow">I couldn't believe it.</font>

165
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,930
<font color="yellow">I carried my dead son...</font>

166
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,570
<font color="yellow">and walked and walked along...</font>

167
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,170
<font color="yellow">a path lined by trees.</font>

168
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,500
<font color="yellow">I kept walking.</font>

169
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,170
<font color="yellow">He was so cute.</font>

170
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,330
<font color="yellow">He had double eyelids, just like me.</font>

171
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,640
<font color="yellow">Let's stop. I miss him now.</font>

172
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,030
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

173
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,370
<font color="yellow">I don't fear death one bit.</font>

174
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,800
<font color="yellow">I'll be reunited...</font>

175
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,530
<font color="yellow">with my husband and the people I miss.</font>

176
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,670
<font color="yellow">You aged so beautifully,</font>

177
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,830
<font color="yellow">so I thought you'd had an uneventful life.</font>

178
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,270
<font color="yellow">But then, no life...</font>

179
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,730
<font color="yellow">is truly uneventful.</font>

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,230
<font color="yellow">Did you really want to see me?</font>

181
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,200
<font color="yellow">Every now and then...</font>

182
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,800
<font color="yellow">I'd wonder how you'd be doing.</font>

183
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,820
<font color="yellow">How honest.</font>

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,830
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have believed it if you said, "all the time".</font>

185
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,170
<font color="yellow">Growing old changes you in a way you don't like.</font>

186
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,130
<font color="yellow">If I were younger,</font>

187
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,830
<font color="yellow">even if you slapped...</font>

188
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,730
<font color="yellow">or attacked me with an axe,</font>

189
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,130
<font color="yellow">I would've still tried to hug you until our ribs broke.</font>

190
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,930
<font color="yellow">I can't now.</font>

191
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,370
<font color="yellow">I'm just too sleepy to.</font>

192
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,630
<font color="yellow">Let's see the sunrise tomorrow.</font>

193
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,270
<font color="yellow">Okay. Goodnight.</font>

194
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,070
<font color="yellow">Who's there?</font>

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,030
<font color="yellow">(Sharpening the Blade of Revenge, Part 1)</font>

196
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,670
<font color="yellow">Are you cold?</font>

197
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,770
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

198
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,600
<font color="yellow">If you're tired,</font>

199
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,770
<font color="yellow">I can carry you.</font>

200
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,400
<font color="yellow">I'm still pretty strong. Get on my back.</font>

201
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,630
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

202
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,530
<font color="yellow">Carry me, then.</font>

203
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,970
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Carry me.</font>

204
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,170
<font color="yellow">Just walk.</font>

205
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,900
<font color="yellow">I used to be able to carry you.</font>

206
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,700
<font color="yellow">Do you remember?</font>

207
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,030
<font color="yellow">You were asleep one night, but I woke you up...</font>

208
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,470
<font color="yellow">and carried you all the way up a mountain.</font>

209
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,770
<font color="yellow">You kissed me first that day.</font>

210
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,700
<font color="yellow">It must've been your wife.</font>

211
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,610
<font color="yellow">We'd gotten into a fight...</font>

212
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,100
<font color="yellow">and took separate buses to go home.</font>

213
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,400
<font color="yellow">I don't like it.</font>

214
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,700
<font color="yellow">You brought your wife to a place we went to.</font>

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,400
<font color="yellow">This isn't the place I brought my wife to.</font>

216
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,130
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

217
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,570
<font color="yellow">My memories get mixed up and I lose track sometimes.</font>

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

219
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,600
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

220
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,500
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

221
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,400
<font color="yellow">The sunrise here is just...</font>

222
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you for bringing me here.</font>

223
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,030
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that...</font>

224
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,230
<font color="yellow">you're still alive.</font>

225
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,930
<font color="yellow">Take my hand. You're embarrassing me.</font>

226
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,030
<font color="yellow">Some other day...</font>

227
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,030
<font color="yellow">No. We might not need to come back.</font>

228
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,300
<font color="yellow">This alone...</font>

229
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,700
<font color="yellow">is good enough.</font>

230
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

231
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,230
<font color="yellow">This is very nice.</font>

232
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,370
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam, thanks to you, we had a great time. Thank you.</font>

233
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,330
<font color="yellow">They're having fun.</font>

234
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,100
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

235
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,270
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous?</font>

236
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,470
<font color="yellow">Are you jealous?</font>

237
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,630
<font color="yellow">I should be the one there.</font>

238
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,300
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

239
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,040
<font color="yellow">I'm off to pee.</font>

240
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,150
<font color="yellow">Just go. Did you have to tell me?</font>

241
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,270
<font color="yellow">It stinks.</font>

242
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,770
<font color="yellow">Would you like me to set up your bed?</font>

243
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,200
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

244
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,630
<font color="yellow">Hi. Where are you?</font>

245
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,170
<font color="yellow">Not me. Where are you?</font>

246
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:33,170
<font color="yellow">At home.</font>

247
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,600
<font color="yellow">What if he faints when he sees me?</font>

248
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,370
<font color="yellow">It's just three hours from now.</font>

249
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,390
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

250
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,030
<font color="yellow">Jeong A's getting a divorce?</font>

251
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,540
<font color="yellow">What's the point of going against her? She made up her mind.</font>

252
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,360
<font color="yellow">I didn't ask for your opinion.</font>

253
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,630
<font color="yellow">I asked you if you're free this week.</font>

254
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,560
<font color="yellow">Okay, check your schedule and call me back.</font>

255
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,930
<font color="yellow">What's going on with Jeong A?</font>

256
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,330
<font color="yellow">Did I tell you to take care of yourself?</font>

257
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,730
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

258
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,200
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself and Ha Neul, too.</font>

259
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,640
<font color="yellow">Say something!</font>

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,950
<font color="yellow">Why does Jeong A want a divorce?</font>

261
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,730
<font color="yellow">Did Seok Gyun agree to it?</font>

262
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,030
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard anything from him.</font>

263
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,030
<font color="yellow">Whose side are you on?</font>

264
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,850
<font color="yellow">What? What side?</font>

265
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,560
<font color="yellow">I'll always be on Jeong A's side.</font>

266
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,260
<font color="yellow">Keep your mouth shut.</font>

267
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,120
<font color="yellow">This is nice.</font>

268
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,230
<font color="yellow">Is she really getting divorced?</font>

269
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,990
<font color="yellow">These cabbages are so fresh.</font>

270
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,580
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

271
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,160
<font color="yellow">- It's 15 dollars.
- Okay.</font>

272
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,520
<font color="yellow">Dad, you should pull the cart.</font>

273
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,530
<font color="yellow">He's so annoying.</font>

274
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,760
<font color="yellow">Stop complaining.</font>

275
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,530
<font color="yellow">Where is the bracken from?</font>

276
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,630
<font color="yellow">It's from Mount Bukhan.</font>

277
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,620
<font color="yellow">Dad, they're fine. Let's just buy it.</font>

278
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,020
<font color="yellow">Bracken from Jeju Island or Mount Jiri is the best.</font>

279
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,280
<font color="yellow">- Give me a bag.
- Sure.</font>

280
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,350
<font color="yellow">Bracken from Jeju Island or Mount Jiri is the best!</font>

281
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,320
<font color="yellow">If you want to beat me for it, go ahead.</font>

282
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,730
<font color="yellow">Enough is enough.</font>

283
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,230
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

284
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,350
<font color="yellow">Dad, we already got pollack. Why are you getting cod?</font>

285
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,450
<font color="yellow">Three, please.</font>

286
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,750
<font color="yellow">Let's just get two.</font>

287
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,280
<font color="yellow">Let him be. This is the last time.</font>

288
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,900
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it's the last time?</font>

289
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,220
<font color="yellow">He nags at you all the time about money.</font>

290
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,200
<font color="yellow">So why is he spending so much on the memorial service?</font>

291
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,320
<font color="yellow">He even invited distant relatives.</font>

292
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,520
<font color="yellow">We should make a lot.</font>

293
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,950
<font color="yellow">Let's hire some help.</font>

294
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,450
<font color="yellow">We can't make it by ourselves. Mum will get sick.</font>

295
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,430
<font color="yellow">That's why we're shopping four days in advance.</font>

296
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,050
<font color="yellow">I'm giving her time to take breaks in between.</font>

297
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,740
<font color="yellow">Look at those arms. Your mum's really strong.</font>

298
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,950
<font color="yellow">She's got so much energy in her. What's so hard about doing...</font>

299
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,360
<font color="yellow">3 to 4 memorial services a year?</font>

300
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,850
<font color="yellow">On top of that, your grandparents...</font>

301
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,240
<font color="yellow">won't eat anything unless it's made by your mum.</font>

302
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,530
<font color="yellow">Think before you open your mouth.</font>

303
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

304
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,650
<font color="yellow">He's so rude to everyone.</font>

305
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,810
<font color="yellow">I got a call.</font>

306
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:12,880
<font color="yellow">Yes, Nan Hee.</font>

307
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, this place isn't going to work.</font>

308
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,390
<font color="yellow">There's no end to cleaning.</font>

309
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,960
<font color="yellow">Don't stop her from the revenge.</font>

310
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
<font color="yellow">Let's go get chickens.</font>

311
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,700
<font color="yellow">Mum, he wants to buy chicken.</font>

312
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,330
<font color="yellow">We already got pork.</font>

313
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,980
<font color="yellow">Tell him you can't. Tell him to stop.</font>

314
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,290
<font color="yellow">He's your dad. Tell him yourself.</font>

315
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,720
<font color="yellow">He's your husband.</font>

316
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,930
<font color="yellow">Should I tell her to sue him?</font>

317
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,850
<font color="yellow">I bet she'll get 200 to 300 grand.</font>

318
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,590
<font color="yellow">It's not enough for an apartment, but she could get somewhere nicer.</font>

319
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,320
<font color="yellow">This is too worn down for an old person like her.</font>

320
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
<font color="yellow">It's worse to live with Seok Gyun.</font>

321
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,160
<font color="yellow">I know. That's why she should ask for compensation.</font>

322
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,050
<font color="yellow">Hey, it's not her who should ask for compensation.</font>

323
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,320
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun should ask for it if anything.</font>

324
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,130
<font color="yellow">His wife and her friends...</font>

325
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,080
<font color="yellow">got a place and is cleaning it behind his back.</font>

326
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,220
<font color="yellow">He's going to feel betrayed.</font>

327
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,870
<font color="yellow">Compensation is for the victim.</font>

328
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,740
<font color="yellow">Looking at how it's been lately,</font>

329
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,950
<font color="yellow">the one who deserves compensation...</font>

330
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,850
<font color="yellow">is Seok Gyun, not Jeong A. Aren't I right?</font>

331
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,060
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

332
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:18,420
<font color="yellow">This is probably worth 10 million dollars in compensation.</font>

333
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,870
<font color="yellow">Poor Seok Gyun.</font>

334
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,280
<font color="yellow">What goes around comes around.</font>

335
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,980
<font color="yellow">This is probably only the beginning of her revenge.</font>

336
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,420
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying it's revenge?</font>

337
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,630
<font color="yellow">It's definitely a revenge.</font>

338
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,430
<font color="yellow">She's been sharpening her knife in silence all this time.</font>

339
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,860
<font color="yellow">She was waiting for the right moment.</font>

340
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,490
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

341
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,620
<font color="yellow">No matter how I think about it, it still feels wrong.</font>

342
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,850
<font color="yellow">She should get a divorce first then leave home.</font>

343
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,750
<font color="yellow">She's stabbing his back.</font>

344
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,560
<font color="yellow">Whether she divorces him first or later,</font>

345
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,630
<font color="yellow">it's the same thing.</font>

346
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,230
<font color="yellow">I saw Dae Cheol.</font>

347
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,830
<font color="yellow">He only sent me flowers for two months.</font>

348
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,390
<font color="yellow">Then he finally asked to meet up in a note.</font>

349
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,230
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

350
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,960
<font color="yellow">I only saw him from outside a window...</font>

351
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,190
<font color="yellow">for about 30 minutes.</font>

352
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,760
<font color="yellow">If his wife is still alive, you shouldn't see him.</font>

353
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,590
<font color="yellow">He probably came because she died.</font>

354
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,460
<font color="yellow">He was a little...</font>

355
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,490
<font color="yellow">aged.</font>

356
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,170
<font color="yellow">Don't see him.</font>

357
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,530
<font color="yellow">You should have had tea with him if you went out.</font>

358
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,390
<font color="yellow">What's the point? It's just tea.</font>

359
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,260
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it if it's not a big deal?</font>

360
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,930
<font color="yellow">Where's Wan? I miss her.</font>

361
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:34,990
<font color="yellow">I don't know. Her phone's turned off.</font>

362
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,960
<font color="yellow">Who knows what she does alone at home?</font>

363
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,830
<font color="yellow">By the way, she broke up with Yeon Ha for sure, right?</font>

364
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,960
<font color="yellow">She must have.</font>

365
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,230
<font color="yellow">She can't marry a disabled.</font>

366
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,430
<font color="yellow">That's the same thing as a married man for me.</font>

367
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,430
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

368
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,030
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hee.</font>

369
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,230
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

370
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,630
<font color="yellow">I took a plane.</font>

371
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,390
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

372
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,090
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

373
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,130
<font color="yellow">Have you been well?</font>

374
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,560
<font color="yellow">Yeon Ha's in bed.</font>

375
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,490
<font color="yellow">Still?</font>

376
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,630
<font color="yellow">He worked all night.</font>

377
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,390
<font color="yellow">He works on a European timeline.</font>

378
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,660
<font color="yellow">Why are you still single?</font>

379
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,630
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why are you?</font>

380
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,460
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

381
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,030
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

382
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,030
<font color="yellow">Can you leave?</font>

383
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,130
<font color="yellow">I'll be in the office.</font>

384
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,490
<font color="yellow">- See you.
- Bye.</font>

385
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,990
<font color="yellow">You don't have to leave.</font>

386
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,360
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean that.</font>

387
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,460
<font color="yellow">She should've left sooner.</font>

388
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,460
<font color="yellow">We met again after three years.</font>

389
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,230
<font color="yellow">Is this the welcome I get?</font>

390
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,840
<font color="yellow">Did I come here for nothing?</font>

391
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,590
<font color="yellow">I flew for 18 hours.</font>

392
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
<font color="yellow">Have you eaten?</font>

393
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

394
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:45,930
<font color="yellow">How about some milk tea?</font>

395
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,730
<font color="yellow">Am I not welcomed?</font>

396
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,960
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Am I not?</font>

397
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,930
<font color="yellow">No, you're welcomed.</font>

398
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,030
<font color="yellow">I was so excited.</font>

399
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,560
<font color="yellow">I thought...</font>

400
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,530
<font color="yellow">you would be so happy to see me...</font>

401
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,030
<font color="yellow">that you'd faint.</font>

402
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,630
<font color="yellow">I guess I was mistaken.</font>

403
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
<font color="yellow">No, I'm pleased.</font>

404
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,760
<font color="yellow">This is a bit weird for someone who's pleased.</font>

405
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,290
<font color="yellow">It's like you're forcing yourself to put up with an unwelcomed guest.</font>

406
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,060
<font color="yellow">You're really cold and distant.</font>

407
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,660
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

408
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,760
<font color="yellow">I'm so happy I want to jump up.</font>

409
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
<font color="yellow">I really am.</font>

410
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,060
<font color="yellow">You have a nosebleed.</font>

411
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,030
<font color="yellow">See? I have a nosebleed!</font>

412
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,460
<font color="yellow">I fought with my mum and stayed up working...</font>

413
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,760
<font color="yellow">for three days just to come here.</font>

414
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,240
<font color="yellow">I took two flights, a taxi and a bus.</font>

415
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,760
<font color="yellow">Gosh... And all I get is this from you!</font>

416
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,960
<font color="yellow">It's like you're...</font>

417
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,360
<font color="yellow">making me pay for upsetting you!</font>

418
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,690
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

419
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:27,190
<font color="yellow">All of my stuff are still in there.</font>

420
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,230
<font color="yellow">Even the photos.</font>

421
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,890
<font color="yellow">So why were you so cold?</font>

422
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,090
<font color="yellow">You scared me! I almost had a heart attack!</font>

423
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,530
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

424
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,010
<font color="yellow">It only took me 18 hours.</font>

425
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,360
<font color="yellow">It was so easy.</font>

426
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,660
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

427
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,430
<font color="yellow">You come without calling now.</font>

428
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,430
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep because of Seok Gyun.</font>

429
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,030
<font color="yellow">If you want to talk about that, leave.</font>

430
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,040
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I won't, then.</font>

431
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,990
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

432
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,730
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

433
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

434
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

435
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,060
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

436
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:30,360
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it pretty?
- It's lovely.</font>

437
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,190
<font color="yellow">Here's the next page. Look.</font>

438
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,430
<font color="yellow">You can colour in from here.</font>

439
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:39,630
<font color="yellow">Drawing and colouring help prevent dementia.</font>

440
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,630
<font color="yellow">Even if it's not for that, it's still fun.</font>

441
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,170
<font color="yellow">You lose track of time.</font>

442
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,360
<font color="yellow">I was painting at home yesterday evening...</font>

443
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,360
<font color="yellow">when I thought of you.</font>

444
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,560
<font color="yellow">I thought I should give this to you.</font>

445
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,260
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm here.</font>

446
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,660
<font color="yellow">Can I do this?</font>

447
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,730
<font color="yellow">- No, no, no.
- What?</font>

448
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,890
<font color="yellow">Use the darker colours later.</font>

449
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,630
<font color="yellow">You have to start with the lighter colours.</font>

450
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,260
<font color="yellow">Use the darker colours at the very last...</font>

451
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,660
<font color="yellow">to add effects.</font>

452
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,040
<font color="yellow">Don't spit on me.</font>

453
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,160
<font color="yellow">- You're too loud.
- Did I spit on you?</font>

454
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,030
<font color="yellow">- Let me.
- No.</font>

455
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,290
<font color="yellow">- Let me help.
- I can manage.</font>

456
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,890
<font color="yellow">- Mum.
- Who's there?</font>

457
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,890
<font color="yellow">The door was open. Did you forget about our date?</font>

458
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,390
<font color="yellow">Oh, right.</font>

459
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,520
<font color="yellow">This man is a very old friend of mine.</font>

460
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,660
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, Yeong Won, Choong Nam...</font>

461
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,660
<font color="yellow">and even Ssang Boon knows him.</font>

462
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,390
<font color="yellow">We met in primary school.</font>

463
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
<font color="yellow">Are you her youngest?</font>

464
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,630
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

465
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,530
<font color="yellow">I should get going.</font>

466
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,260
<font color="yellow">I'll see you at mass.</font>

467
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,430
<font color="yellow">I'll go and get changed.</font>

468
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,230
<font color="yellow">If you're hungry, eat the pastry he brought.</font>

469
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,230
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

470
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,430
<font color="yellow">I'll see you around.</font>

471
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,430
<font color="yellow">You're nice and tall.</font>

472
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

473
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
<font color="yellow">Leave it!</font>

474
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,690
<font color="yellow">Yes, it was great.</font>

475
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,890
<font color="yellow">How great?</font>

476
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:15,860
<font color="yellow">Very.</font>

477
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,420
<font color="yellow">Did you have to say that to me?</font>

478
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,430
<font color="yellow">I said that on purpose.</font>

479
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,860
<font color="yellow">Isn't this better than having regrets?</font>

480
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,070
<font color="yellow">Why did you call?</font>

481
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,260
<font color="yellow">I heard about Jeong A's plans.</font>

482
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,390
<font color="yellow">I think it's wrong.</font>

483
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,360
<font color="yellow">She sold her house without his knowing.</font>

484
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,650
<font color="yellow">It was in her name. Seok Gyun has his own.</font>

485
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,890
<font color="yellow">Are there legal issues?</font>

486
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,020
<font color="yellow">No, there shouldn't be any legal issues.</font>

487
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,870
<font color="yellow">If Seok Gyun and Jeong A get into a legal dispute,</font>

488
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,230
<font color="yellow">I'll hire you for Jeong A's attorney.</font>

489
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,690
<font color="yellow">How much will it cost?</font>

490
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,600
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

491
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,760
<font color="yellow">If there's an issue between a married couple,</font>

492
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,910
<font color="yellow">they should sort it out by talking to each other.</font>

493
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,980
<font color="yellow">Doing that won't solve the problem. It'll only cause chaos.</font>

494
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,820
<font color="yellow">Just sit back and watch.</font>

495
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,600
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun will cry.</font>

496
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,490
<font color="yellow">Then you can wipe his tears for him.</font>

497
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,470
<font color="yellow">We'll all be gone soon.</font>

498
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,940
<font color="yellow">Think about Seok Gyun. He's an old guy.</font>

499
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,860
<font color="yellow">You really care for him, don't you?</font>

500
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,660
<font color="yellow">You should just live with him then.</font>

501
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,960
<font color="yellow">It will look disgusting.</font>

502
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,690
<font color="yellow">Hey,</font>

503
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,230
<font color="yellow">those jerks just drank 300 dollars' worth of drinks.</font>

504
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,760
<font color="yellow">Artists don't have money.</font>

505
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,330
<font color="yellow">Just give them what they want.</font>

506
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,280
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

507
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,690
<font color="yellow">You should be nicer to my friends.</font>

508
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,100
<font color="yellow">They're not your friends. They're only using you.</font>

509
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,820
<font color="yellow">You're such a pushover.</font>

510
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,190
<font color="yellow">Don't be so rude.</font>

511
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,530
<font color="yellow">Am I having diarrhoea?</font>

512
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,130
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

513
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,530
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

514
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,130
<font color="yellow">This looks comfortable. Let's do this one.</font>

515
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,860
<font color="yellow">We'll take two pillows as well.</font>

516
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,230
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

517
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,920
<font color="yellow">- Why are you being like that?
- What?</font>

518
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,770
<font color="yellow">That man is just a friend.</font>

519
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,980
<font color="yellow">A friend and nothing else.</font>

520
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,710
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything.</font>

521
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,360
<font color="yellow">Give us the pillows and the duvet.</font>

522
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,260
<font color="yellow">Stay as friends, okay?</font>

523
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,360
<font color="yellow">Don't see him too often either.</font>

524
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,830
<font color="yellow">I won't. I don't see him often.</font>

525
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:43,460
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

526
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,930
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

527
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,460
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

528
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,600
<font color="yellow">Why are you there?</font>

529
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,980
<font color="yellow">Do you live here?</font>

530
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,390
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

531
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,030
<font color="yellow">Are you sure this is the place?</font>

532
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,990
<font color="yellow">No... No...</font>

533
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,560
<font color="yellow">I remember now! I got it now, don't worry.</font>

534
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,100
<font color="yellow">Mum, you have to come to your senses.</font>

535
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,060
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's in this neighbourhood?</font>

536
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,890
<font color="yellow">Min Ho, I'm not sure.</font>

537
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,060
<font color="yellow">It's not this way. We went up there... Then...</font>

538
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,260
<font color="yellow">It's okay, it could happen.</font>

539
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,130
<font color="yellow">I'll call Jeong A.</font>

540
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,760
<font color="yellow">Don't panic. It's okay.</font>

541
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,760
<font color="yellow">I love you, Mum.</font>

542
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,060
<font color="yellow">Where was it?</font>

543
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,100
<font color="yellow">We went that way...</font>

544
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,230
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, it's Min Ho.</font>

545
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,430
<font color="yellow">Yes. Mum got lost.</font>

546
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,630
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to the park?</font>

547
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,930
<font color="yellow">Let's stay in.</font>

548
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,030
<font color="yellow">We stayed in for 52 hours.</font>

549
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,060
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to order in.</font>

550
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,600
<font color="yellow">We finished all the sundae, japchae...</font>

551
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,690
<font color="yellow">and dumplings from Korea.</font>

552
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,730
<font color="yellow">I love your bed.</font>

553
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,160
<font color="yellow">It makes me fall asleep.</font>

554
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,290
<font color="yellow">Let's go out.</font>

555
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,890
<font color="yellow">Let's stay in.</font>

556
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:18,730
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going back to Seoul?</font>

557
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:22,930
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

558
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,760
<font color="yellow">That's why we should stay here.</font>

559
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,100
<font color="yellow">Then let's clean up a little.</font>

560
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,830
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Let's not clean up and go out.</font>

561
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,760
<font color="yellow">Out?</font>

562
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:43,490
<font color="yellow">What about your clothes?</font>

563
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,330
<font color="yellow">Just like this?</font>

564
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,660
<font color="yellow">Don't think about anything else. I'm right here.</font>

565
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,860
<font color="yellow">Yes. You're here.</font>

566
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,890
<font color="yellow">What time is your flight?</font>

567
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,490
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I forgot.</font>

568
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:16,560
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm here with you.</font>

569
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, and bare-naked.</font>

570
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,060
<font color="yellow">I'll bring your phone.</font>

571
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:38,860
<font color="yellow">I'll bring more tea, too.</font>

572
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,130
<font color="yellow">Yes, Yeon Hee.</font>

573
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,530
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you had a good time.</font>

574
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,390
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

575
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,690
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Wan...</font>

576
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,830
<font color="yellow">just came.</font>

577
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:58,890
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

578
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,590
<font color="yellow">You know what I mean by that, right?</font>

579
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,460
<font color="yellow">She has a mother and she's the only child.</font>

580
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,130
<font color="yellow">She'll go back again.</font>

581
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

582
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,160
<font color="yellow">She'll leave again just like before.</font>

583
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,490
<font color="yellow">Don't expect anything, okay?</font>

584
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,890
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

585
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,660
<font color="yellow">When are you leaving?</font>

586
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,090
<font color="yellow">Tonight.</font>

587
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,830
<font color="yellow">I think I have seven hours left.</font>

588
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,090
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

589
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,360
<font color="yellow">Let's walk.</font>

590
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,090
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

591
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,330
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

592
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,390
<font color="yellow">- Be healthy.
- To health.</font>

593
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,720
<font color="yellow">To everyone's health.</font>

594
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,960
<font color="yellow">That's right, I helped her out then.</font>

595
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,530
<font color="yellow">Soo Young, bring more alcohol.</font>

596
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,090
<font color="yellow">- Coming.
- Coming.</font>

597
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,980
<font color="yellow">You're in such a good mood.</font>

598
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,120
<font color="yellow">More japchae, too!</font>

599
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,190
<font color="yellow">Coming!</font>

600
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:14,190
<font color="yellow">- Have some.
- Mum!</font>

601
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,590
<font color="yellow">Where's Mum?</font>

602
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,690
<font color="yellow">Is she sleeping in the bathroom?</font>

603
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,760
<font color="yellow">She stayed up all night making food.</font>

604
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,290
<font color="yellow">Let's leave her to get a break.</font>

605
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,730
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

606
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:27,830
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

607
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,160
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

608
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

609
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,560
<font color="yellow">Don't drink so much.</font>

610
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,730
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get drunk again?</font>

611
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,560
<font color="yellow">All right, cheers.</font>

612
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,430
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

613
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,960
<font color="yellow">My mother is almost disabled.</font>

614
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,140
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here if you're not pooping?</font>

615
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,390
<font color="yellow">Don't just drink, eat some food.</font>

616
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,360
<font color="yellow">- I'm taking a break.
- Where are the hwatu cards?</font>

617
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:56,730
<font color="yellow">Underneath the television.</font>

618
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,930
<font color="yellow">Just go and find them for me.</font>

619
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,890
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

620
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:02,760
<font color="yellow">My clothes.</font>

621
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,190
<font color="yellow">What are all these? Is she throwing them out?</font>

622
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,760
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's clear the tables and play some hwatu.</font>

623
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,700
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- It's 20 cents per point.</font>

624
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,860
<font color="yellow">Gwang Soo, stop drinking by yourself.</font>

625
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,960
<font color="yellow">I decided to see Dong Jin.</font>

626
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:48,330
<font color="yellow">I sent him a text before coming here.</font>

627
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,890
<font color="yellow">Apparently, he's moving to the United states.</font>

628
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,360
<font color="yellow">It's not because of me.</font>

629
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:56,560
<font color="yellow">His wife is feeling lonely. It worked out.</font>

630
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:02,930
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

631
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,430
<font color="yellow">What do you think about the book I'll write about the old mules?</font>

632
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,290
<font color="yellow">Do you think it'll be interesting?</font>

633
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,730
<font color="yellow">Will it be too dreary?</font>

634
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,830
<font color="yellow">Old people can be funny.</font>

635
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,430
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to write about them at first,</font>

636
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,030
<font color="yellow">but I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to write about Mum.</font>

637
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:27,860
<font color="yellow">That's what all writers wish for.</font>

638
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,030
<font color="yellow">Her friends have a lot of stories of their own.</font>

639
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,960
<font color="yellow">I finished a draft in my head.</font>

640
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,760
<font color="yellow">I need to interview more.</font>

641
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,730
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of publishing it as a book.</font>

642
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,130
<font color="yellow">Let's have some tea.</font>

643
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,160
<font color="yellow">I'm amazed.</font>

644
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,460
<font color="yellow">At what?</font>

645
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:24,830
<font color="yellow">The tea or...</font>

646
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,960
<font color="yellow">my wheelchair skills?</font>

647
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,730
<font color="yellow">Both.</font>

648
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:33,860
<font color="yellow">It's level ground.</font>

649
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,050
<font color="yellow">I'm translating a book,</font>

650
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,860
<font color="yellow">and writing a novel...</font>

651
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,090
<font color="yellow">about my mum and her friends.</font>

652
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,160
<font color="yellow">If I work 10 hours a day,</font>

653
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:58,100
<font color="yellow">it'll take me 3 to 4 months.</font>

654
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,360
<font color="yellow">It'll take 5 to 6 months at the most.</font>

655
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,830
<font color="yellow">After that, I can pack up...</font>

656
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,260
<font color="yellow">Don't make any promises.</font>

657
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
<font color="yellow">Just leave.</font>

658
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,860
<font color="yellow">I'll just think...</font>

659
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,490
<font color="yellow">that you came back because you missed Slovenia.</font>

660
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,930
<font color="yellow">I came back not for you but for Slovenia?</font>

661
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:29,330
<font color="yellow">You're impulsive.</font>

662
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,490
<font color="yellow">And you like me.</font>

663
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:34,890
<font color="yellow">So you flew over.</font>

664
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,730
<font color="yellow">But make this the last time.</font>

665
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:58,690
<font color="yellow">Then will you...</font>

666
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,660
<font color="yellow">stay here waiting for me?</font>

667
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,560
<font color="yellow">I'll just be here.</font>

668
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,390
<font color="yellow">No waiting involved.</font>

669
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,390
<font color="yellow">I work here...</font>

670
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,460
<font color="yellow">and the scenery's great.</font>

671
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,160
<font color="yellow">If I meet someone, I can date her.</font>

672
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,930
<font color="yellow">It didn't work out with Nikita.</font>

673
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,430
<font color="yellow">I have to come back.</font>

674
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:24,430
<font color="yellow">Right now,</font>

675
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,060
<font color="yellow">I look at my legs...</font>

676
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,660
<font color="yellow">and I think it's just a discomfort.</font>

677
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,930
<font color="yellow">But if you say you'll come back and you don't,</font>

678
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,660
<font color="yellow">I might really hate my legs.</font>

679
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:42,030
<font color="yellow">I'll blame them...</font>

680
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,030
<font color="yellow">for pushing you away.</font>

681
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,760
<font color="yellow">I'm stuck with these legs forever.</font>

682
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,290
<font color="yellow">Be more considerate.</font>

683
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,130
<font color="yellow">Shut up.</font>

684
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,090
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue.</font>

685
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,560
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

686
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,130
<font color="yellow">Am I here because I'm impulsive?</font>

687
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,930
<font color="yellow">After three long years, I took two planes, a taxi and a bus.</font>

688
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,660
<font color="yellow">It took me 18 hours.</font>

689
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,690
<font color="yellow">Wan.</font>

690
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,760
<font color="yellow">We might break up over something else,</font>

691
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,860
<font color="yellow">but it won't be your legs.</font>

692
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,330
<font color="yellow">You work and can move around.</font>

693
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:25,360
<font color="yellow">I'm strong and have no problem looking after you.</font>

694
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,190
<font color="yellow">I'm tall enough to reach the top shelves, too.</font>

695
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,660
<font color="yellow">Do you think you have the upper hand because I love you?</font>

696
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,190
<font color="yellow">I said I'll come back. You just...</font>

697
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:37,360
<font color="yellow">You still love me...</font>

698
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,090
<font color="yellow">despite my disability.</font>

699
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,190
<font color="yellow">So should I just say,</font>

700
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:43,190
<font color="yellow">"thank you"?</font>

701
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,530
<font color="yellow">You left when you wanted and then you came back.</font>

702
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,990
<font color="yellow">Then you'll leave.</font>

703
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,860
<font color="yellow">You should.</font>

704
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,080
<font color="yellow">You should thank me.</font>

705
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,090
<font color="yellow">What if I can't?</font>

706
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,760
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

707
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,660
<font color="yellow">I will come back to you whatever my mum says.</font>

708
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,500
<font color="yellow">I decided to do so when I came here.</font>

709
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,530
<font color="yellow">And I...</font>

710
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:39,230
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you through the screen of a laptop or phone.</font>

711
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,160
<font color="yellow">When I come back,</font>

712
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,260
<font color="yellow">you'd better live much harder than you do now.</font>

713
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,330
<font color="yellow">You need to increase your upper body strength...</font>

714
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:51,590
<font color="yellow">and exercise your legs much more than...</font>

715
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,750
<font color="yellow">I do enough!</font>

716
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,160
<font color="yellow">You have to do more if you're to live with me.</font>

717
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,670
<font color="yellow">My uncle walked again after being bedridden for seven years.</font>

718
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,360
<font color="yellow">He drags one leg but he walks.</font>

719
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,990
<font color="yellow">You have to do the same if you're to live with me.</font>

720
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,390
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

721
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,150
<font color="yellow">never walk again.</font>

722
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,470
<font color="yellow">Make it work.</font>

723
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,280
<font color="yellow">You can't only do what you can.</font>

724
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,290
<font color="yellow">Do what you can't.</font>

725
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,390
<font color="yellow">My mum was adamant I don't marry a disabled man.</font>

726
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,050
<font color="yellow">She says I'm all she has.</font>

727
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,580
<font color="yellow">Give me a reason to justify myself for choosing you over her.</font>

728
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,260
<font color="yellow">Help me say that...</font>

729
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,650
<font color="yellow">you're stronger than anyone and that you never give up.</font>

730
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:33,560
<font color="yellow">Help me do this.</font>

731
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,380
<font color="yellow">I'll return when I'm done.</font>

732
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,660
<font color="yellow">After I give her the book.</font>

733
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,430
<font color="yellow">It's my mum's wish.</font>

734
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,860
<font color="yellow">If you don't return,</font>

735
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,760
<font color="yellow">I will kill you.</font>

736
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,760
<font color="yellow">Such nice timing.</font>

737
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

738
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,890
<font color="yellow">See you again.</font>

739
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,330
<font color="yellow">Make him exercise his legs.</font>

740
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,940
<font color="yellow">There should be plenty of rehabilitation clinics.</font>

741
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,120
<font color="yellow">What about your mum?</font>

742
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,190
<font color="yellow">Sorry about using her as an excuse.</font>

743
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,960
<font color="yellow">I will come back.</font>

744
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,560
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

745
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,660
<font color="yellow">We'll wait.</font>

746
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,730
<font color="yellow">By the time I come back, you'd better be married and gone.</font>

747
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,160
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?</font>

748
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,490
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

749
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,960
<font color="yellow">It's an emergency.</font>

750
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:30,260
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

751
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,730
<font color="yellow">You're still young.</font>

752
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,430
<font color="yellow">Don't panic...</font>

753
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,660
<font color="yellow">like you did last time.</font>

754
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,590
<font color="yellow">I love you</font>

755
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:56,230
<font color="yellow">There is only you</font>

756
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,930
<font color="yellow">I scream your name</font>

757
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:04,390
<font color="yellow">But the sunset answers me back</font>

758
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,860
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won is in a shoot right now.</font>

759
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:17,730
<font color="yellow">Where's the tangsuyuk?</font>

760
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,710
<font color="yellow">- It's coming.
- Yes.</font>

761
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,730
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- Where's the tangsuyuk?</font>

762
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,860
<font color="yellow">Coming.</font>

763
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,740
<font color="yellow">- Here's hot water.
- Here you go.</font>

764
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,390
<font color="yellow">That looks great.</font>

765
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,730
<font color="yellow">Enjoy.</font>

766
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,130
<font color="yellow">(Choong Nam)</font>

767
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,630
<font color="yellow">The number you're calling...</font>

768
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:40,630
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja is too old.</font>

769
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,560
<font color="yellow">Jeong A has the memorial service today.</font>

770
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,090
<font color="yellow">Even if it's an emergency,</font>

771
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,660
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't call someone too old.</font>

772
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,860
<font color="yellow">Professor Park, it's me.</font>

773
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:07,490
<font color="yellow">- Where are you?
- You should call 911.</font>

774
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,830
<font color="yellow">Yes. Where does it hurt?</font>

775
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:15,730
<font color="yellow">What should I do? My kids are coming back to Korea,</font>

776
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:17,310
<font color="yellow">so I have to go to the airport.</font>

777
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

778
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:21,960
<font color="yellow">You should call 911 right away.</font>

779
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,760
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

780
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,830
<font color="yellow">It's Choong Nam.</font>

781
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,760
<font color="yellow">Don't pick it up. She's sick.</font>

782
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,630
<font color="yellow">I should talk to her if she's sick.</font>

783
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:34,990
<font color="yellow">Her voice sounds fine. She's okay.</font>

784
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:37,090
<font color="yellow">Also, she has her nephews. Don't worry.</font>

785
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:39,130
<font color="yellow">Anyway, is everyone here?</font>

786
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:40,890
<font color="yellow">Yes, they were here for a while. Come on.</font>

787
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,130
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

788
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,390
<font color="yellow">Professor Park.</font>

789
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,660
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

790
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,890
<font color="yellow">I should get dressed...</font>

791
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,460
<font color="yellow">then call 911.</font>

792
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,090
<font color="yellow">I should call 911.</font>

793
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,390
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

794
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,360
<font color="yellow">Don't lose it.</font>

795
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,090
<font color="yellow">It'd be okay to go like this.</font>

796
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:36,190
<font color="yellow">But if I don't go, I'll become disabled.</font>

797
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:48,730
<font color="yellow">(Ssang Boon)</font>

798
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:52,940
<font color="yellow">What happened? She called me, too.</font>

799
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:54,800
<font color="yellow">I called her back, but she didn't pick up.</font>

800
01:00:56,970 --> 01:00:59,570
<font color="yellow">- You too?
- There must be an emergency.</font>

801
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,070
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

802
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mum.</font>

803
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,140
<font color="yellow">How can you go there with your tractor?</font>

804
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,870
<font color="yellow">I was going to go,</font>

805
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,170
<font color="yellow">but my leg...</font>

806
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,070
<font color="yellow">All right. I got it.</font>

807
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,570
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving now.</font>

808
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,670
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

809
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,530
<font color="yellow">I can't go because of the group reservation.</font>

810
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,130
<font color="yellow">You should go at least.</font>

811
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,890
<font color="yellow">What if the old woman dies alone?</font>

812
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,050
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be responsible?</font>

813
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,670
<font color="yellow">Why is it always about life or death for you?</font>

814
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,910
<font color="yellow">That's how it is with us old people.</font>

815
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:58,430
<font color="yellow">Are you going to go or not?</font>

816
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,970
<font color="yellow">Fine, I'll go.</font>

817
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,040
<font color="yellow">Right now!</font>

818
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,740
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

819
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:17,970
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out?</font>

820
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,640
<font color="yellow">Because I'm a woman.</font>

821
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,740
<font color="yellow">They won't let us stay in since we're women.</font>

822
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:26,570
<font color="yellow">- Then...
- Then...</font>

823
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,440
<font color="yellow">- why do they eat...
- why do they eat...</font>

824
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,540
<font color="yellow">- the food that we make?
- the food that we make?</font>

825
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:32,640
<font color="yellow">What's with the bag?</font>

826
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,540
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave your father.</font>

827
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,770
<font color="yellow">That's a good idea.</font>

828
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,470
<font color="yellow">Are you going to throw him away?</font>

829
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:42,100
<font color="yellow">Good idea.</font>

830
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,900
<font color="yellow">Yes, you should throw things away in your life for a change.</font>

831
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:47,720
<font color="yellow">I found myself a place. I'll live alone. Come visit me.</font>

832
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,840
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Sure.</font>

833
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,620
<font color="yellow">When can we go home?</font>

834
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,230
<font color="yellow">Once they finish the food,</font>

835
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,240
<font color="yellow">our uncles and the elders...</font>

836
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,260
<font color="yellow">are going to ask me why I got a divorce.</font>

837
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,130
<font color="yellow">If they ask you, just tell them you never got a divorce.</font>

838
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,570
<font color="yellow">They probably won't remember.</font>

839
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,970
<font color="yellow">Should I try that?</font>

840
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:08,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

841
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,540
<font color="yellow">- I will.
- Be good to your father.</font>

842
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,240
<font color="yellow">He's your husband, so you should be good to him.</font>

843
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,240
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

844
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,240
<font color="yellow">Yes, Honey.</font>

845
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:21,670
<font color="yellow">No, I don't know when I'll be home.</font>

846
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,700
<font color="yellow">Is Ddollae sleeping?</font>

847
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,600
<font color="yellow">Put him to sleep for once, will you?</font>

848
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,870
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, underwear.</font>

849
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:11,340
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

850
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:17,370
<font color="yellow">Are you sleeping?</font>

851
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,700
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

852
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,000
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

853
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,570
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

854
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,240
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

855
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,740
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

856
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,470
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

857
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,240
<font color="yellow">Water!</font>

858
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,540
<font color="yellow">Give me water.</font>

859
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,340
<font color="yellow">Water.</font>

860
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,200
<font color="yellow">Gentle Jeong A finally left Seok Gyun alone...</font>

861
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:03,200
<font color="yellow">after 50 years of marriage. She really left him.</font>

862
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,200
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

863
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,470
<font color="yellow">Jeong A!</font>

864
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,840
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

865
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:16,170
<font color="yellow">It was your appendix. The surgery went well.</font>

866
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,820
<font color="yellow">You should've called me.</font>

867
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,540
<font color="yellow">I'm glad she didn't.</font>

868
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:23,780
<font color="yellow">All your friends are here over one little appendix.</font>

869
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:25,270
<font color="yellow">What a nuisance.</font>

870
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,690
<font color="yellow">Ssang Boon was so smart.</font>

871
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,220
<font color="yellow">I know that. I'm pretty smart.</font>

872
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:33,270
<font color="yellow">You called me but didn't pick up when I called back.</font>

873
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,750
<font color="yellow">So I called 911 and came straight over here.</font>

874
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,170
<font color="yellow">I saved your life. Make it up to me.</font>

875
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,340
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

876
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:51,670
<font color="yellow">We're having a great time without you, Professor Lee.</font>

877
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,800
<font color="yellow">He sent it to you by mistake.</font>

878
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
<font color="yellow">Get some sleep.</font>

879
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:06,600
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

880
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,300
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better now?</font>

881
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,690
<font color="yellow">Are you awake?</font>

882
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,170
<font color="yellow">You're awake.</font>

883
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,170
<font color="yellow">I had you sent over here so you wouldn't feel lonely.</font>

884
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:18,940
<font color="yellow">Aren't you pleased?</font>

885
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,510
<font color="yellow">When it counted the most,</font>

886
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:25,770
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam, who preferred younger people,</font>

887
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:30,270
<font color="yellow">was surrounded by her old friends and even older relatives.</font>

888
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:35,440
<font color="yellow">That quiet morning was when her will to get her revenge...</font>

889
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,840
<font color="yellow">slowly rose to the surface.</font>

890
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,040
<font color="yellow">Those fools.</font>

891
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,100
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you all.</font>

892
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:19,940
<font color="yellow">(Dear My Friends)</font>

893
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,120
<font color="yellow">Jeong A. Jeong A!</font>

894
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,470
<font color="yellow">This is how you get revenge.</font>

895
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:26,010
<font color="yellow">Whack him in the back of the head.</font>

896
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,570
<font color="yellow">We can't travel the world, but we can go to China or Japan.</font>

897
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:30,540
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes and read this.</font>

898
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,200
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes!</font>

899
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,100
<font color="yellow">Everything you're saying is crazy!</font>

900
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,170
<font color="yellow">- Life is crazy.
- Life is crazy.</font>

901
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,540
<font color="yellow">I'll make them pay.</font>

902
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:40,540
<font color="yellow">Didn't I make that?</font>

903
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,510
<font color="yellow">It's fine, leave it. Throw it away.</font>

904
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,640
<font color="yellow">All you care about is money and fame.</font>

905
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,370
<font color="yellow">You're the worst kind.</font>

906
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,200
<font color="yellow">Are you two dating?</font>

907
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,950
<font color="yellow">To ask what?</font>

908
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,800
<font color="yellow">If you and I will get along.</font>

909
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:55,640
<font color="yellow">Are you a playboy?</font>
