3
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,970
Jeong A!

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,500
Jeong A, my back. My back.

5
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,310
Scratch my back.

6
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,830
More, more.

7
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,300
No, no. You can't do that.

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,587
Sit down. You drip all over.

9
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:46,293
Hey, how can a man pee while sitting down?

10
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,424
I peed sitting down since I was 40.

11
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:52,070
You're over 70. Who cares about pride? Come on.

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,730
Just sit down.

13
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,230
Mum, you should make up with Dad. This is ridiculous.

14
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,770
Do you want to taste it?

15
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,990
The day-care's not doing well,

16
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,063
and my husband is stressed because of work.

17
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm...

18
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,230
on Mum's side. I'll be fine even if she gets a divorce.

19
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,330
You can only say that because Dad doesn't call you.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,700
I went to clean two days ago, too.

21
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,600
It's not as often for you.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,940
He would tell me to make siraegiguk instead of ugeojiguk.

23
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,630
Then he'd ask me over to make him guksu.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,830
Mum. Let's end it after a month.

25
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,084
If that's too short, let's do three months before you go back.

26
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:45,587
I'll ask Dad to come and beg you.

27
00:02:45,587 --> 00:02:47,824
Do you really think Dad will beg?

28
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,304
Then what do you suggest we do?

29
00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,500
What do you think? She should get a divorce. Mum's a woman, too.

30
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,850
Right, Mum? You're a woman, too.

31
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,370
You want to live the rest of your life as a woman, right?

32
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,600
Goodness. How am I a woman?

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,600
My uterus was taken out after I had that cyst.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,446
Also, who cares if I'm a man or a woman at this age?

35
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:08,670
You are both wasting your time blabbering away.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,570
How can we not?

37
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,070
How can you leave after all that? Your life would be a failure.

38
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,770
Why is her life a failure?

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,587
It's Dad who can't do anything on his own that's the failure.

40
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,500
I agree that Dad's at fault, but...

41
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
There's no reason for you to talk about your dad like that.

42
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,010
When he was young, he worked so hard to raise you.

43
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,670
He worked at that helmet factory. To make a dollar more,

44
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,670
he'd work late until midnight while his nose...

45
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,643
and ears froze in the cold winter.

46
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:37,370
He's over 70 and still works so that he can support himself.

47
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,870
You have no right to talk about him like that.

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,170
You don't want to cook for him? Then don't.

49
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,730
Just buy it for him. You're so ungrateful.

50
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,230
- Mum, that's...
 - It's not what I meant.

51
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,204
Be quiet and just give me my money.

52
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:53,500
I even cleaned your mosquito net, so give me 20 dollars more.

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,230
Take all of this.

54
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,824
I'll give you 100 dollars from now, so go back to Dad and...

55
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,953
Why would I take more money from you?

56
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,870
Do you think I left home to bother you?

57
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,830
Usually, it's 60 dollars, but today, it's 80 dollars. That's it.

58
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,500
I know how you feel,

59
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,870
but you shouldn't talk about your dad like that.

60
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,820
Also, don't you dare nag at me any more.

61
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,970
I'm sick of hearing it.

62
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,563
You're spending a lot ever since you moved out.

63
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:30,700
Yes, I'm splurging. I spent a fortune worth of eight dollars.

64
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,993
Can you digest all this?

65
00:04:32,993 --> 00:04:35,294
You can't because you stay indoors all day.

66
00:04:35,294 --> 00:04:36,300
You need to walk more.

67
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,700
My stomach hurts all the time.

68
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,530
I don't even eat much, but I poop 3 to 4 times a day.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
What's wrong?

70
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,430
Stay for the night.

71
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Okay.

72
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,474
I love that you moved out. You can sleepover whenever.

73
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:53,863
Shall I call the others?

74
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:54,870
Okay.

75
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,530
Nan Hee.

76
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,870
What are you doing?

77
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,770
What a place this is.

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,500
Are you dating him?

79
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,930
Not really.

80
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,260
He invited her over to listen to him sing.

81
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,729
He flung his fishing rod and caught her.

82
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:27,670
And you took the bait.

83
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,570
After wasting all your life,

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,970
you took the bait now?

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
Don't smile.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,470
You're still very young.

87
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,714
You should date men.

88
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:41,730
Like you?

89
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,000
How are things with Seong Jae?

90
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,463
We aren't dating. We just meet up.

91
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,100
If you just meet up,

92
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,470
what should she do?

93
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,630
She can grope him all she wants.

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,760
Why can't she?

95
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,930
I bet her skin's still smooth.

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,553
What?

97
00:05:59,553 --> 00:06:01,060
And yours isn't?

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,090
My skin is like leather.

99
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,830
- Yours must be soft.
 - Come on.

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
Don't. Not in public.

101
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't you dare touch me.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,750
If you do, I will pinch you until you burst.

103
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,600
You talk such nonsense for people your age.

104
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Choong Nam.

105
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,993
Us?

106
00:06:20,993 --> 00:06:22,400
We're at a live café.

107
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,217
Did Yeong Won and the others...

108
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:28,173
see the man you like?

109
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,407
I feel left out.

110
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:30,470
It's your fault.

111
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,217
You said you couldn't be bothered to join us. Are you jealous now?

112
00:06:33,217 --> 00:06:36,900
Don't have too much fun without me. Go home early.

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,387
(Jeong A)

114
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:44,593
Jeong A, don't forget that the next few days...

115
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:47,770
is our trial run of living together, okay?

116
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,400
I haven't forgotten.

117
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,870
She's talking about us living together.

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,670
You'll end up pulling each other's hair out. Give me that.

119
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,430
Hey, Choong Nam, wake up.

120
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,090
You may think we get along, but we don't at all.

121
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,850
Who doesn't get along with whom?

122
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,430
You and the rest of us.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,600
You need to live alone.

124
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,053
You're too old to try to get used to living with someone.

125
00:07:14,053 --> 00:07:15,070
No.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
This time, I will try to make things work.

127
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,200
It's like my last piece of homework.

128
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,920
Haven't you heard of something called "a bucket list"?

129
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,100
Why? Are you planning to die?

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,830
I want to live with you.

131
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,670
Me, too.

132
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,270
Him?

133
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,756
He's pretty.

134
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:37,040
Who is?

135
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,070
That guy.

136
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,170
He's young and handsome. Quite fresh.

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,777
I can't stand the way you talk.

138
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:47,680
All she does is wipe the floors with rags,

139
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,370
- so she talks like one.
 - Hey.

140
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
He looked at Nan Hee.

141
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, see you then.

142
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,170
He must really like her.

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Hi, In Bong.

144
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,800
Why did she vomit?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,670
I envy Nan Hee. She's seeing a fresh, young man.

146
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,600
She's living the life I never got to.

147
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,070
Hang on.

148
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,930
If we decide to live together...

149
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,400
If that happens...

150
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,280
Shall I make them pay 300 dollars a month for expenses?

151
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,760
Is that too much? 200?

152
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,700
Wait. Water, electricity...

153
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,430
and gas bills...

154
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,010
We'll have to take turns doing the laundry and cleaning.

155
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,500
Washing the dishes.

156
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,530
Hee Ja can do it on Mondays.

157
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,930
Jeong A will do it on Tuesdays.

158
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,780
On Wednesdays...

159
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,630
Yeong Won and Nan Hee work, so forget about them.

160
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Do I have to do it for the rest of the week?

161
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,670
Shoot.

162
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,270
Mum, Grandma will be okay.

163
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,600
It's bound to happen one day.

164
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,047
It is.

165
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,363
She's 90 years old.

166
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:15,770
We should prepare for the worst.

167
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,470
How can a daughter prepare for her mother's death?

168
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,230
Should I cut wood and make a coffin?

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,100
Don't say that because she's my mum, not yours.

170
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,450
Then again, you wouldn't blink an eye if you heard that...

171
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,900
I were dead.

172
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,620
You're evil. You only agreed to come along...

173
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,217
to write your book.

174
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:37,200
You told me to write something.

175
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,300
No matter what I say...

176
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
What?

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,940
We never get along.

178
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,770
We never will.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,670
We're polar opposites.

180
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,400
My wife and I...

181
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,600
got along very well.

182
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,930
I loved her more than anything.

183
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,450
I reported to her whenever...

184
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,300
I left the house and returned.

185
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,070
And any money I earned, I gave to her every month.

186
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,453
If I thought my parents were giving her a hard time,

187
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:17,000
I put them aside for a while and focused...

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,400
all my energy on her.

189
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,600
I was a good husband.

190
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,470
Shortly before she died, she said,

191
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,500
"Honey, let's meet again."

192
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,070
That's what she said to me.

193
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,630
Will Jeong A appreciate that?

194
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,900
If I call her...

195
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,800
and ask about things?

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,400
Are you willing to try?

197
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,800
Of course, she'll like it.

198
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,100
All women like that.

199
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,230
Do they?

200
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,730
The cotton candy

201
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,840
Is as white as snow, and clean and fluffy

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,570
It's just like the cotton candy I ate

203
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,200
When I went on a walk with Mum

204
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
Hello?

205
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,970
Sleep well.

206
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

207
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I said, "Sleep well."

208
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,900
And I said, "Okay."

209
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,470
You should tell me to sleep well.

210
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,530
- What is it?
 - If I tell you to sleep well,

211
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,400
shouldn't you say it back?

212
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,763
I even called to say that.

213
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:52,270
Who told you to call?

214
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,230
Don't call if you want to show off.

215
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,700
(Power Off)

216
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,130
Jeong A.

217
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,630
Jeong A.

218
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,400
(100 Things I Know I Did Wrong,)

219
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,870
(10,000 Things I Didn't Know I Did Wrong)

220
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,400
He's trying really hard to be nice...

221
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,370
I never asked for a phone call.

222
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,470
Then what do you want from him?

223
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
I don't know.

224
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,030
I don't mind cooking for him...

225
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,230
and I know he can be frustrating.

226
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,670
And I do feel sorry for him.

227
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,000
But right now,

228
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,970
I hate everything.

229
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,430
But I don't know why I feel this way.

230
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,170
I'm upsetting the girls...

231
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,956
Are you hurt?

232
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:53,970
I don't know.

233
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,420
Sit down.

234
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,270
Sit down somewhere.

235
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,090
Are you okay?

236
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,430
Now that I'm old, my legs keep giving up.

237
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,100
Forget about our legs.

238
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,300
Our kids want us to keep our heads on straight.

239
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,570
A newborn can't walk even if it can think properly.

240
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,610
It's all about our age.

241
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,270
Let's take a rest.

242
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I'd carry you if I had the energy.

243
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,930
Do you think they'll think we're weird?

244
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,993
Two old ladies are sitting in the street...

245
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,100
late at night instead of being in bed.

246
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,100
I can't do this with Seok Gyun.

247
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,700
If we were walking along and I felt weak,

248
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,930
he could suggest a break.

249
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,400
If I get hurt,

250
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,560
he could tell me to be careful like you just did.

251
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,270
Instead, he complains and scolds me by saying...

252
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,200
mean things like, "Get a grip. What's wrong with you?"

253
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,930
I spent all my married life with him,

254
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,000
so it'd be cheap to curse at him.

255
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,630
Do it.

256
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You jerk.

257
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,230
All those years together...

258
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,970
and that's the best I can do.

259
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Both he and I...

260
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,900
will die sooner than later. So what would I want from him?

261
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,687
You don't need a husband or a man.

262
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:35,530
It'd be nice to just live like best friends.

263
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,730
Kind of like you and me. Good friends. Right?

264
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,430
It's a tough life.

265
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,770
It's hard to have a friend that's not a burden to you.

266
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,770
A cotton candy

267
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,800
Got hooked on a branch

268
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,030
Like a thread

269
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,070
The cotton candy

270
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,370
Is white

271
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,170
As snow

272
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,900
I have to go back to the United States next week.

273
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,030
Let's meet on Thursday, Yeong Won.

274
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm so hungry.

275
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,000
Why is she sleeping here?

276
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,530
Jeong A, why are you sleeping here instead of your place?

277
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,280
Well?

278
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,730
Stop bothering me and just go to sleep.

279
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,370
Why is she sleeping here?

280
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,630
Did she fight with Seok Gyun?

281
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,790
All right.

282
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,800
Sure. Even that little guy is running away to live.

283
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,770
What are you doing here?

284
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,740
Working, what else?

285
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,000
You acted like you were sleeping last night.

286
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,500
It's time for lunch. Why are you working?

287
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,490
Let's get you tested in Seoul today.

288
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,300
It'd be good news if I died.

289
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes, it sure is.

290
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,770
Hey. When I die, make sure you hit the gong.

291
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,980
"Oh Ssang Boon is finally free."

292
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,570
Play the trumpets, throw flower petals and slaughter a pig for me.

293
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,530
Are you kidding me?

294
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,670
Grandma, do you want us to bury you with a skate?

295
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,200
Of course, you fool.

296
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,790
Skate is a necessity in any mourner's house.

297
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,130
Sure. If it's for my dear grandma,

298
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll get you domestic skates instead of the Chilean kind.

299
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,940
I'll invite all your neighbours and even people over there.

300
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,170
"Everyone, come get yourself some raw skates!"

301
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,400
Are you serious?

302
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,060
Not again! You're weak to me anyway.

303
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,630
Let go of me. Let go.

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
Grandma isn't dying. She's not sick.

305
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,070
She says she threw up because she ate too much.

306
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,440
She threw up during the day and at night, too!

307
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,480
Don't worry. She won't die.

308
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,570
See? I'm right. She's not dying, right?

309
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,300
That guy agrees with me. What's wrong with you?

310
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,230
He's your uncle. Show some respect.

311
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,970
Mum won't die even if everyone in the village dies.

312
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,470
She'll have a long life.

313
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,670
Don't curse me.

314
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,290
Grandma, it's true.

315
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,130
Your mum and your grandma...

316
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,200
all lived until their 90s and 100s.

317
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,670
That's why Mum and I are healthy, and we don't even get a cold.

318
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,730
Shut your mouth!

319
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
We're going to the hospital.

320
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm not going.

321
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,200
You can't die. What will happen to Dad and In Bong?

322
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,470
I'm not doing this for you. It's for me.

323
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,940
I can't live with Dad and In Bong.

324
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,170
I'll live happily with Jacqueline and Dad.

325
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,070
Shut your mouth.

326
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,380
Sorry.

327
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,400
Why are you scolding him?

328
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Mum, if you cared even the slightest for me,

329
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,600
you'd go to the hospital!

330
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,680
Do you want your widowed daughter to take care...

331
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,530
of your husband and your disabled son?

332
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,300
It's not fair you get to go alone! How can you be so irresponsible?

333
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,730
Do you want me to talk like that, too? "I wish I could die."

334
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
Don't talk that nonsense.

335
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Come eat!

336
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,130
I knew you'd get yelled at.

337
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,300
Just tell her you'll go.

338
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,180
Goodness.

339
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,800
It'll cost us.

340
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,400
In Bong has to get married soon.

341
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,870
I have so much work I have to do as well.

342
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,070
- Mum!
 - What?

343
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,270
She'll go to the hospital after she finishes work and on your day off.

344
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,440
Okay. Don't work too much and bring her home after.

345
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,070
I'll make some sujebi.

346
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,530
What are you doing?

347
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,270
You're supposed to do what Mum says.

348
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,930
I love you, but you talk too much.

349
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,830
If you make her upset, I'll scold you.

350
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,200
You!

351
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,300
Be good to your mum.

352
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Okay?

353
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,770
Uncle.

354
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,700
Did you do any of this with Jacqueline yet?

355
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,770
Twice.

356
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,830
He did this with Jacqueline!

357
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Look at him. He's so happy.

358
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,400
I didn't know you did such a thing.

359
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,170
No, hold on.

360
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,800
This isn't right. Hold on.

361
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,270
I think this would be better. I just bought these.

362
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,200
That's way too big.

363
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,500
Just try it.

364
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
My...

365
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,870
Gosh, these are huge.

366
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,560
You can't tell at all.

367
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,270
Make sure he doesn't touch them.

368
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,400
You can tell that it's fake.

369
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,470
What are you talking about?

370
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,100
Hey, you know that everyone will come today, right?

371
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,480
I do. I'll be back early.

372
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,000
Come late. We won't wait for you.

373
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
You can see us any time you want.

374
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,200
He probably has a wife, right?

375
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Tell him to get a divorce.

376
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,900
Tell him it's wrong to live with one woman for so long.

377
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,630
I love you.

378
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,370
That's why we should live together.

379
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,600
I wonder if he's as excited as I am.

380
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
If not, then forget him. Don't hold him back.

381
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
I'll get going.

382
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,970
Why did he leave such a beautiful girl behind?

383
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,630
Wretched jerk.

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,830
Hey, Choong Nam!

385
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,270
You were home.

386
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Why are you here?

387
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,200
Well...

388
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,510
Someone gave us a call.

389
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,530
What?

390
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,000
He said he wanted to buy my work.

391
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,700
He said something about an exhibition in America.

392
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,430
The pieces you sold through your friend's gallery...

393
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,630
I sold what was mine. Is that a problem?

394
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,900
Not at all.

395
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,110
It's just that someone wants to show our pieces in America,

396
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,870
so we were wondering...

397
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,100
if we could buy or borrow what you bought from us.

398
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:52,950
No.

399
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,990
Choong Nam, this opportunity...

400
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,300
It's the first opportunity in our lives. Please, just once.

401
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,400
I liked you when you were young.

402
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
When you were part-time lecturers.

403
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,800
You came here every day to talk about art,

404
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,970
and then you cried because you couldn't support yourselves.

405
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,670
Why are you mentioning that?

406
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,070
I liked you then.

407
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,400
I wasn't educated...

408
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,200
and knew nothing about art.

409
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,400
But seeing you cling onto it even when you went hungry...

410
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
made me think that art was something great.

411
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,830
Just get to the point.

412
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:38,070
All you care about now is money and success.

413
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,570
You are fools and losers.

414
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,780
Let's go.

415
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,830
Wait.

416
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,880
Choong Nam, you shouldn't say that.

417
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,370
You bought our pieces for cheap and sold them for way more.

418
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,000
You should thank us.

419
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,770
You just won't stop, will you?

420
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,170
Forget it, then.

421
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,700
Leaving me out...

422
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,690
and mocking me is probably the least terrible thing you did.

423
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,970
The worst thing you did...

424
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,430
was not realising your true value.

425
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,000
Don't sell pieces you spent time and tears to make so easily.

426
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,400
I'll make the exhibition happen.

427
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,330
I'd have proposed to you if you were 10 years younger.

428
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:33,000
If you were 10 and I were 30 years younger.

429
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,770
Thank you.

430
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Let's go.

431
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,570
Give me time to park.

432
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,630
No. I'll call you.

433
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,140
Excuse me. Can I have another herb tea?

434
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,170
Sure.

435
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,400
You haven't changed.

436
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,970
Not really.

437
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,970
How is your wife?

438
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,170
How is your health?

439
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,400
We haven't met in over 30 years.

440
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,800
I think so.

441
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,970
Go.

442
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,600
Let's have a meal and a drink together.

443
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,470
No thanks.

444
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,870
I'm a noisy eater and I don't want you to see that.

445
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,630
Go home.

446
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:21,100
It's good to see that you seem well.

447
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,440
Let's eat dinner together.

448
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,170
No, I want to go.

449
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,930
I'll go first.

450
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,430
Look after yourself.

451
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,070
Yes, it's me. Can you come and get me?

452
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeong Won's reunion with her first love whom she never got over...

453
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,130
ended just like that.

454
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,330
When she saw him again, she didn't feel the need to ask...

455
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,270
why he had left her or say that she missed him.

456
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,630
And then, she said this.

457
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,470
Until now,

458
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,500
I thought that people grew old...

459
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,330
but that their spirits or hearts didn't.

460
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,210
But?

461
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,570
Today, I realised...

462
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,800
our hearts grow old, too.

463
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,130
He suggested we eat out.

464
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,830
But I thought, "What's the point?"

465
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,600
He suggested a drink.

466
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,530
But I thought, "What difference would that make?"

467
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,530
That's my heart growing old.

468
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,330
You silly.

469
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,870
But what Yeong Won said to me before leaving for the States was...

470
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,430
the complete opposite.

471
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,330
"I wish I ate with him."

472
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,630
"I wish we had that drink."

473
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,830
She just added one more thing to regret...

474
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,200
in her not-so-eventful life story.

475
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,480
Can I really believe every single thing you said?

476
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,300
That you were pleased to see Dae Cheol?

477
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,130
Of course. It was nice. It really was.

478
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Okay, then.

479
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,630
- Is she evil?
 - The other one's worse.

480
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,130
She's so mean.

481
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,830
Be quiet. I can't hear a thing they're saying.

482
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,200
- She grabbed her hair.
 - Look.

483
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,730
Oh dear.

484
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,630
- She didn't like it.
 - Did she say so?

485
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,530
Before she washed her face, I saw her make-up was a mess.

486
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,630
She can't fool me.

487
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,210
She said she had a nice time and I pretended to believe her.

488
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,230
Well done.

489
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
- Good riddance.
 - She had it coming.

490
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,730
Television time is over.

491
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,800
- Let's keep watching.
 - Just a bit more.

492
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,200
- Come on.
 - Hey!

493
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,530
How mean.

494
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,430
What should we do now?

495
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,630
(Monthly expense, cleaning duties)

496
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,130
We're all old,

497
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,000
so if we live together, we need to be equal.

498
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,100
There's no respecting elders here.

499
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,190
I was never like that.

500
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,400
- What about Mum?
 - Are you going to make her cook?

501
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,820
Ssang Boon is an exception.

502
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,170
If we're going to be fair, why do I only pay 200 dollars?

503
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,960
The rest of you are paying 300 dollars.

504
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,390
The wealthy should pay more. That's what's fair.

505
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,890
Don't you know what fair means?

506
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:43,070
I see. That's why.

507
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,660
All right, now...

508
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,800
I told you about cooking and living expenses.

509
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,300
Next up is cleaning duties.

510
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,360
The cleaning duty is...

511
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,220
We're just trying it out today.

512
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,000
Why are you planning so far ahead?

513
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,910
And I can already tell after spending half a day together.

514
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,340
We won't get along.

515
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,420
Take television time as an example.

516
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,400
You could have waited until the show was over,

517
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,170
but you turned it off.

518
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,530
Hold on.

519
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,090
Get the blankets out.

520
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,970
We're not here to just sleep. Can't we chat and play?

521
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,300
Old people should sleep early.

522
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,690
Get washed up for bed.

523
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,580
We'll do it in the order of age.

524
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,960
What's with her?

525
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,680
You're at an army.

526
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,890
You better move fast...

527
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,340
if you don't want the drill instructor to yell at you.

528
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,580
Also,

529
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,500
I'm just a shadow today. I won't be helping out.

530
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,670
All that I'll do today is observe. You know that, right?

531
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:34,350
Do drill instructors in the army do whatever they want?

532
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,300
How would I know?

533
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,340
You probably don't know.

534
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,200
Choong Nam, where are the blankets?

535
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,770
Yeong Won.

536
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,680
Please wash them well.

537
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,700
Okay.

538
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,500
Hey, help out.

539
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,710
No, I'm observing today.

540
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,150
You're so mean.

541
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,360
Come on, clean it well.

542
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,470
- Don't just skim over it.
 - Yes, Ma'am.

543
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,640
Where should I put these?

544
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,230
Where do you think?

545
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,570
In the living room.

546
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,900
Good girl.

547
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,870
Choong Nam.

548
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,300
- What?
 - Toothpaste.

549
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,100
It's right there in your hand.

550
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,570
Sorry.

551
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,730
What?

552
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,430
- Towel.
 - It's on your neck.

553
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,670
Goodness, this is why old people should just die.

554
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,770
Have this.

555
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,870
Here.

556
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,780
I'll pour it for you.

557
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,800
Okay.

558
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,390
Here. This is good for you.

559
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,730
I only have enough for you.

560
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,100
Drink up.

561
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,670
- That's mine and that's yours.
 - Okay.

562
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,970
Here's your water.

563
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,670
There's one more.

564
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,270
What a sight.

565
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,760
They're chugging pills to live on.

566
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,190
There's so much.

567
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,500
They'll be full from all those pills.

568
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,270
Turn it off.

569
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,370
Stop being so loud.

570
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,730
Sorry.

571
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,170
Hee Ja, come back.

572
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,700
Do you need fresh air?

573
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,300
You'll catch a cold if you go out now.

574
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,840
Come back and sleep.

575
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:05,670
Why are all of us sleeping at your place?

576
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
What are you talking about?

577
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,470
Just sleep.

578
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,500
Hee Ja, let's sleep.

579
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Sleep.

580
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
I'm hungry.

581
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,340
You shouldn't eat in the middle of the night.

582
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,670
Go to sleep.

583
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,390
Where are you going?

584
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,500
To the bathroom.

585
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,470
It's not that way. It's this way.

586
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
This way.

587
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,070
Come here.

588
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Choong Nam,

589
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,900
don't live together.

590
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,000
Shut your mouth.

591
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I can tell after today...

592
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,270
that you're like Mother Teresa.

593
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,400
What's that?

594
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,170
It's someone who lived kindly and died.

595
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,430
Did she go to a good place?

596
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,800
I think so.

597
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,200
Thank you.

598
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,570
This way, this way.

599
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,400
Sleep.

600
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,600
Are you regretting it?

601
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,340
Should we not live together?

602
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,840
Gosh, she can snore.

603
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:26,710
Come on, let me sleep.

604
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:29,170
You're the only one actually getting sleep.

605
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,970
She's the only one that slept.

606
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,730
- My goodness.
 - Goodness.

607
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,160
We'll stretch to the left first.

608
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,570
Look towards the sky.

609
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,630
Now, the other side.

610
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,530
Look towards the sky.

611
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
Fold to the front.

612
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,530
Go as low as you can.

613
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,720
- More, more.
 - That hurts.

614
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,070
Don't do that. You're going to kill her.

615
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,530
Just don't do it.

616
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,270
You're the one who wanted to do it.

617
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,000
Hey, take a break.

618
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,430
You can't do it. I'll do it.

619
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,700
Come on.

620
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,960
Are you going to leave us like you did to Seok Gyun?

621
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,320
Do you enjoy slaving?

622
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,510
Go rest.

623
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,680
Okay.

624
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,930
Let me try what my actor friend can cook up.

625
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,630
See you tonight.

626
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,240
- Okay.
 - Bye.

627
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,700
- Wan, drive safe.
 - I will.

628
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Bye.

629
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,770
Bye.

630
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:40,990
- Hee Ja!
 - Yes?

631
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,770
Hee Ja! Your diaper bag.

632
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,730
Jeong A, your phone!

633
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,370
Jeong A, Jeong A.

634
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,600
- Nan Hee!
 - Jeong A, Jeong A.

635
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,230
Your phone. You forgot it.

636
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:54,370
Right. Yes. That's mine.

637
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,400
Nan Hee.

638
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,830
You wore my aunt's shoes.

639
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,000
Right. I'm so forgetful.

640
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,200
Oh, right. Yeong Won, your pills!

641
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,000
Yes, I forgot.

642
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,600
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

643
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,800
I asked Choong Nam...

644
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:18,200
why she thought about living with them.

645
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,390
She said the thing she regrets the most in her life...

646
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,370
is never having had someone to get along with.

647
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,610
So before she dies,

648
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,710
and although it may require extra work and effort,

649
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,000
she wanted to try to get along with her friends.

650
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,800
That's why.

651
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:39,810
Really?

652
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,700
That doctor was evil. He gave you a painful shot.

653
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,470
I'll be there the day after tomorrow.

654
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,980
Yes, I'll be there in two days.

655
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,570
Come on. Don't cry now.

656
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,100
I'll see you soon.

657
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,200
Bye.

658
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,170
Hee Ja.

659
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:07,230
Don't be silly.

660
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:10,870
You didn't bother me at all. I had so much fun.

661
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,500
Let's do it before winter comes.

662
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,400
Of course. Before winter.

663
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:21,200
By the way, where were you trying to go last night?

664
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,800
Hee Ja said that along with looking after her extended family,

665
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,900
this was the next best thing she had done.

666
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,670
I said I agreed with her.

667
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:36,270
And for the first time ever,

668
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,400
I gave Choong Nam a big hug.

669
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Excuse me.

670
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,230
- Joseph.
 - Yes?

671
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:11,830
Our caretaker saw this last night and informed me.

672
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,870
It looks like...

673
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,870
she just came in to pray.

674
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,600
Can we watch it again?

675
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,500
(Seok Gyun)

676
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,100
Did you say there were more footage?

677
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,570
The phone is...

678
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,470
Why isn't he picking up?

679
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,700
Is he busy working?

680
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,200
(Jeong A)

681
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,870
Excuse me. Can you help me?

682
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Sure.

683
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,130
It's okay.

684
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,900
Are you okay?

685
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,700
You're so pretty.

686
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,570
Oh, my. It's a new chair.

687
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,980
Could you carry it?

688
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,490
It's quite heavy.

689
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,670
You shouldn't work if you can't carry that.

690
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,830
Madam.

691
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,380
I'll carry the dog while you carry the chair.

692
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,400
How dare you touch my baby with your dirty hands?

693
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,000
It's a dog, not a child!

694
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,070
Gosh, why did you yell at me?

695
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,270
Do you want to get fired?

696
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,110
I quit before you can get me fired.

697
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,600
I'm a security guard, not your servant.

698
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,570
Your husband works for someone else, too, right?

699
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,400
I'm old enough to be your father. Know your manners.

700
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,270
- Hold back.
 - I won't!

701
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,900
Do you take me for a fool?

702
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,700
I do this to make a living.

703
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,280
I work for my pay!

704
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,920
How dare you treat me like you pay me for doing nothing?

705
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,400
Would you like it if someone treated your husband like that?

706
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,430
I hope the dog's fleas end up all over you!

707
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,570
What's wrong with you women including my wife?

708
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,300
Sir.

709
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:30,850
Sit down before you get hurt.

710
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,600
I'm about to sit!

711
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,370
Everyone abuses elders these days.

712
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,400
Get up.

713
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
What are you looking at?

714
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:39,640
- Seok Gyun.
 - No. I don't want to.

715
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,230
You're such a loser. Man up.

716
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,230
Gosh.

717
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,300
Look.

718
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:49,870
Help...

719
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:06,430
Dad, Mum made extra and told me to give you some.

720
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,740
I cleaned up, but I'm too busy to stay.

721
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,680
Dad, I'm not that nice to you, but that's not how I feel.

722
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,770
I respect you. Take care of yourself.

723
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:19,990
Let's go travelling.

724
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:22,730
Go alone. I'm cleaning up.

725
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,190
You wanted to go travelling.

726
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:26,330
I'm cleaning now.

727
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,400
Gosh.

728
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,100
She's acting up because I let her.

729
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:46,900
What did I do wrong? What did I do so wrong?

730
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Forget it.

731
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,170
I don't need you.

732
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,100
Hey, you scumbag! Drive properly!

733
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,370
Don't you care for old people?

734
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,770
Do you expect us to put up with everything...

735
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,100
and sacrifice what we have when you need help?

736
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:12,570
I can kill you all!

737
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,530
What?

738
00:52:50,770 --> 00:52:52,340
Jeju Island is too far for a honeymoon,

739
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,600
but we should have at least gone to a nice hot spring.

740
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,300
It's nice here, too.

741
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,040
When I get rich,

742
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,700
we'll go on a world tour.

743
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,400
I'll take you.

744
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:08,570
We won't have to sleep over at a friend's old house...

745
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,860
in the countryside for a trip.

746
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,340
Promise me.

747
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,070
I promise.

748
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,440
Once my brothers get married, we'll go.

749
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,940
I think it'll be 10 years from now.

750
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:29,570
I can wait.

751
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
But...

752
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,170
How can we travel without our parents?

753
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,940
Let's go after we finish taking care of them.

754
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:40,600
We'll go in about 30 years.

755
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,200
30 years is too long!

756
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,800
20 years.

757
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,240
I won't even be 50 by then.

758
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,120
I can definitely wait until then.

759
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,170
By the way,

760
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,170
we have to leave here early in the morning.

761
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,070
Their grandmother is returning from Seoul.

762
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,200
I'm just grateful that we can stay here on our own...

763
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,700
without your parents and siblings.

764
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,000
That house she was so grateful for...

765
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,900
only collected dust.

766
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,570
She could have come just to pray.

767
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:31,270
Pray at 2am?

768
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,300
She was wearing slippers and her pyjamas.

769
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,770
She just had a cardigan on.

770
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,340
I only told you because that bothered me.

771
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,070
You should keep observing her and let her kids know.

772
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,970
"The nursing home is your second home."

773
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,170
"If you have to go, smile while you leave."

774
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:04,420
"If you get dementia..."

775
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,940
Try this.

776
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:08,200
Okay.

777
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,700
It's good.

778
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,540
I'm glad you like it.

779
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,070
Should we just live together?

780
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,170
Are you crazy?

781
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:26,330
I would never do something my kids hate.

782
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:29,020
What is there to hate?

783
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,020
They'll be glad to get you off their shoulders.

784
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,720
At least my kids will think so.

785
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,270
If I was sick, maybe. But for now, I think they prefer me to be alone.

786
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,860
If I picture my mum with another man,

787
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,470
I think it'd be awkward, too.

788
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,470
If it weren't for the kids,

789
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,790
you'd be interested?

790
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,200
It'd be nice to have someone to talk to if you're not hitting on me.

791
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,400
- Hit on you?
 - Yes.

792
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,040
Are you telling me not to touch you?

793
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,670
Are you going to touch me?

794
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:10,570
Don't you have the instructions for those cameras?

795
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,600
Why?

796
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,370
I like reading manuals.

797
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:17,900
It's there beside the pills somewhere.

798
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,900
Okay.

799
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,170
Yes, there.

800
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,200
Yes.

801
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,070
All right.

802
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,440
Let's take a look.

803
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,340
Let's see if it's working right.

804
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,940
Let's see if the cameras...

805
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,740
are protecting my first love well.

806
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,670
Yes, Min Ho.

807
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,800
It's the cotton candy you had when you went on a picnic

808
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,870
With your mum's hand in yours

809
00:58:02,070 --> 00:58:06,170
- If you blow it, it'll make holes
 - Look.

810
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,470
If you blow it

811
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:18,270
Look at that.

812
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:20,940
It'll make holes

813
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,570
A big cotton candy

814
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,970
With your mum's hand in yours

815
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,470
The cotton candy

816
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,570
Look at this.

817
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,540
That mum bought you

818
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,970
I was wearing pants...

819
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,170
but he still did it!

820
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,470
Dad!

821
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,300
Honey.

822
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,600
What? What is it now?

823
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,780
Could you take this home for me?

824
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:15,970
I'm working here. Do you want to die?

825
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,840
I think the baby...

826
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,700
So...

827
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:23,640
I have to go to the hospital.

828
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:28,440
They said it's a boy this time.

829
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,740
Don't make a fuss. Why would there be anything wrong?

830
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:32,900
Just go home!

831
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,340
Both the mum and the daughter are driving me crazy.

832
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:14,120
You came to ruin our family, didn't you?

833
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,420
Where did my clothes go after you washed them?

834
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,180
You threw it out because you knew I liked it, didn't you?

835
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,740
Well? Get up.

836
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,970
Mother, please! I'm so sorry!

837
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,300
Please don't pull my hair!

838
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,440
Where is it? Go find it!

839
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,070
You threw it out, right?

840
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:11,320
It's just a cold. Why would she call her mum about that?

841
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,600
What did you teach your kids?

842
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:16,670
They're such whiners. They take after you, you know that?

843
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,290
What is this?

844
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,600
It's such a waste to throw it out.

845
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,700
Then why did you pay money to buy it then make it go bad?

846
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,070
You are well out of your mind, aren't you?

847
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:28,070
If anyone saw you eat your three meals for a day,

848
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,000
they'd think you're a wrestler.

849
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,700
A fat wrestler at that!

850
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,700
Stay here for 10 more minutes.

851
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,000
What about the world tour you promised me...

852
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,040
when I took care of your eight siblings?

853
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,670
If I didn't hold you back with that promise,

854
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,070
you would've left me already.

855
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,650
I don't want to die in a hospital...

856
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:49,200
like my mum did.

857
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,700
I want to fly free like a bird...

858
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:54,740
and die on the streets.

859
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,140
Mum...

860
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,900
Okay.

861
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,870
If you won't come over, I'll go.

862
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,380
Where do you live?

863
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,930
Shall I ask your mum?

864
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,400
Just tell him to come over.

865
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,590
He wants to give you something to write about.

866
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:30,170
Just spare him an hour.

867
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,920
And get rid of this.

868
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,170
You guys broke up.

869
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,200
Be quiet.

870
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,270
I only have an hour. Will that be enough?

871
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,670
Okay.

872
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,190
I know where you live. I dropped Jeong A off before.

873
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,130
It's block 409, flat 505.

874
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,450
Do you know where?

875
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,940
I'll come over.

876
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,270
He's so annoying.

877
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,760
Don't be like that to the old man. You're such a brat.

878
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:07,140
He should be more thoughtful.

879
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:09,750
He acts like old age makes him special.

880
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:11,400
By the time I'm done with the book,

881
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,200
I think I'll hate talking to old people.

882
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:18,140
They act how they want just because they think they'll die soon.

883
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,390
It's obvious what he'll say.

884
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:22,610
He'll either brag or complain about his life.

885
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:24,130
Or he'll curse others.

886
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,740
I have a feeling you're talking about me.

887
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,600
What was that?

888
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,700
I started exercising my legs at the pool.

889
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,300
It's you.

890
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:48,930
How are you?

891
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,250
Wan's not in. She just left.

892
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,040
Oh, that's fine.

893
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,140
I can talk to you.

894
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,570
Are you well?

895
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,400
My brother can walk now.

896
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:01,400
You can't, can you?

897
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,840
It was a serious accident.

898
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,370
I see.

899
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:10,700
You still have to exercise your legs.

900
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,540
I bet they hurt a lot at night.

901
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:15,400
Take care.

902
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:18,240
And date women.

903
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,770
How's your mother? I heard she's ill.

904
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,740
I'm going to take her to the doctor.

905
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,680
Let's talk again.

906
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,710
I have to go.

907
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:31,970
She said, "My stomach feels strange."

908
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:37,900
She was carrying groceries on her head.

909
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,340
But I just got mad.

910
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,070
Blood was dripping down her legs.

911
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:46,970
So...

912
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,040
she stayed at a hospital for two days.

913
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,970
I felt bad for her.

914
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,540
After that,

915
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,210
I should have kept my mouth shut.

916
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,400
But I said, "Get up and cook for me."

917
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:03,370
I said that.

918
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,370
After that,

919
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:12,800
we both acted like nothing happened.

920
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,870
We were together.

921
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,900
But now, I'm alone.

922
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,070
Others, and even Soon Young,

923
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,280
think that I was mean and arrogant...

924
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,870
even though I knew I was wrong.

925
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:34,870
But I had no idea.

926
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,070
It was so long ago...

927
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,300
and my focus was on making a living.

928
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,440
I did so terribly wrong, didn't I?

929
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,990
The biggest sin...

930
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,670
is not knowing what you did wrong. Being ignorant.

931
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,640
You can't count the mistakes you didn't know you made.

932
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,040
That's why...

933
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,710
I will let my wife go.

934
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,300
You can write about everything I said...

935
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:19,000
if you want others to know there are people like me.

936
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:21,710
Well...

937
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:23,470
Seok Gyun.

938
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,980
Just like how you talked to me so freely just now,

939
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,190
tell Jeong A...

940
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,600
I can't cook or do the washing.

941
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:34,800
No.

942
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:38,140
I won't work her any more.

943
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,070
Go.

944
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:45,040
And quit smoking, Kid.

945
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,000
You should eat lunch.

946
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:55,500
Shall I cook something?

947
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,710
Seok Gyun.

948
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,570
Seok Gyun.

949
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,400
Just go.

950
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:18,570
Okay, then.

951
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:31,340
Someone said that...

952
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,980
we do more bad than good...

953
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,210
during our whole lives.

954
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,980
That's why...

955
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,930
we have much more to gain than to lose,

956
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:43,370
and we are blessed.

957
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:47,340
So instead of having regrets,

958
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,570
we should be grateful we're alive.

959
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,650
Is life really a blessing we should be...

960
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:57,740
grateful for?

961
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,540
Even to my mum and grandma?

962
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,670
I sincerely hope that this will be...

963
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:08,830
the ending to the book that I'll leave to my mother when I go...

964
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,070
live with Yeon Ha.

965
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,600
Ms Jang Nan Hee is...

966
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,620
That's me.

967
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,000
(Dear My Friends)

968
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,330
"The husband must speak in a small voice..."

969
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,540
"and always be kind." What a joke.

970
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:14,740
I pressed the button.

971
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,270
At least, he won't starve.

972
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,220
Do you like me or him?

973
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,620
Did you sleep with him?

974
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,780
What?

975
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:22,260
Don't fall for anyone else.

976
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,720
You sound like an evil boyfriend...

977
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,860
who sells your girlfriend.

978
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:27,200
I'll be waiting.

979
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,030
I should tell Hee Ja's kids, right?

980
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,610
She's not at church?

981
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:34,000
How are we going to find her?
