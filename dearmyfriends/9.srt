3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,610
<font color="yellow">Did you break up with Dong Jin?</font>

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,440
<font color="yellow">We didn't have to break up.</font>

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,610
<font color="yellow">Why did you date Dong Jin when you left Yeon Ha?</font>

6
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,140
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,710
<font color="yellow">I'm here to interview you.</font>

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,470
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,470
<font color="yellow">Your wish was...</font>

10
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:47,010
<font color="yellow">for me to write a novel...</font>

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,110
<font color="yellow">about you and your friends.</font>

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,370
<font color="yellow">So I'm here to interview you.</font>

13
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,740
<font color="yellow">Why did you break up with Yeon Ha?</font>

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,810
<font color="yellow">Did you like him?</font>

15
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,540
<font color="yellow">Did you date him?</font>

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,070
<font color="yellow">Where should we begin?</font>

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,140
<font color="yellow">When you were born?</font>

18
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,740
<font color="yellow">Or around your earliest memories?</font>

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,440
<font color="yellow">Should we start there?</font>

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,640
<font color="yellow">You dated him, didn't you?</font>

21
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,340
<font color="yellow">I'm pretty sure you did.</font>

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,070
<font color="yellow">Why did you break up?</font>

23
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,240
<font color="yellow">Did he cheat on you?</font>

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,840
<font color="yellow">Like Dong Jin did?</font>

25
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,270
<font color="yellow">He's disabled.</font>

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,510
<font color="yellow">You told me not to marry a disabled man.</font>

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,710
<font color="yellow">So we broke up.</font>

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,710
<font color="yellow">No, I pretty much threw him away.</font>

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,210
<font color="yellow">I'm that obedient.</font>

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,010
<font color="yellow">Shall we begin the interview?</font>

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,240
<font color="yellow">How about this?</font>

32
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,110
<font color="yellow">Your story should begin...</font>

33
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,110
<font color="yellow">when we visited Grandma when I was six.</font>

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,110
<font color="yellow">Let's start there.</font>

35
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,140
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,810
<font color="yellow">I remember it so clearly.</font>

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,610
<font color="yellow">Why did you try to kill me?</font>

39
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,210
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember? In the field.</font>

40
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,370
<font color="yellow">What field?</font>

41
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,140
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

42
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,940
<font color="yellow">No... Have you lost your mind?</font>

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,910
<font color="yellow">What nonsense are you talking about?</font>

44
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,310
<font color="yellow">Did you really not date Dong Jin?</font>

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,710
<font color="yellow">Then why did he kiss you?</font>

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
<font color="yellow">Why did you hug?</font>

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,840
<font color="yellow">No woman in her right mind would hug a married man.</font>

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,310
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare like to me.</font>

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
<font color="yellow">- That was a mistake. - A mistake?</font>

50
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,170
<font color="yellow">That's an excuse.</font>

51
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,340
<font color="yellow">Were you obedient?</font>

52
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,740
<font color="yellow">Were you so obedient that you...</font>

53
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,010
<font color="yellow">decided to play the other woman?</font>

54
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,740
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

55
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,210
<font color="yellow">I'll wait.</font>

56
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,670
<font color="yellow">I mean less to you than dog poop on the street!</font>

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,210
<font color="yellow">How could you when you know what your dad did to me!</font>

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,170
<font color="yellow">What? It was a mistake?</font>

59
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,740
<font color="yellow">How dare you say such a thing?</font>

60
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,440
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Yes?</font>

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,810
<font color="yellow">Clean the tables inside.</font>

63
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,010
<font color="yellow">- We have new customers. - Okay.</font>

64
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,140
<font color="yellow">- A tangsuyuk and three jjamppongs? - Yes.</font>

65
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,110
<font color="yellow">How dare she stiffen her neck at me?</font>

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,640
<font color="yellow">I'm her mother.</font>

67
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,940
<font color="yellow">Where did she learn to give me a look like that?</font>

68
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,110
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be so lenient with her.</font>

69
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,680
<font color="yellow">- That's hot. - Gosh.</font>

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,040
<font color="yellow">Put ice on it.</font>

71
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,710
<font color="yellow">We have a group of 30 coming in tonight.</font>

72
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,410
<font color="yellow">Give them a lot of free dishes. I'm going home.</font>

73
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,040
<font color="yellow">I told you I'd fry them.</font>

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,140
<font color="yellow">- We're on our own tonight. - It's going to be crazy.</font>

75
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,870
<font color="yellow">Work if you have time to chat.</font>

76
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,570
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,310
<font color="yellow">That's tasty.</font>

78
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,340
<font color="yellow">"Ma'am, it's Dong Jin."</font>

79
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,840
<font color="yellow">"It's a misunderstanding. Wan and I are not what you think."</font>

80
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,510
<font color="yellow">"We're not..."</font>

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,410
<font color="yellow">What a lie.</font>

82
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,810
<font color="yellow">Can't he make up his mind?</font>

83
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,340
<font color="yellow">He's going to leave for United States with his wife soon.</font>

84
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,140
<font color="yellow">I should just kick him again.</font>

85
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,680
<font color="yellow">Do you sell these in single bags?</font>

86
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,770
<font color="yellow">I just want one bag.</font>

87
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,180
<font color="yellow">I just asked you a question.</font>

88
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,180
<font color="yellow">Do you or do you not?</font>

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,070
<font color="yellow">We only sell them in packages...</font>

90
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,970
<font color="yellow">Why are you rude to me?</font>

91
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,410
<font color="yellow">You were rude to her first.</font>

92
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

93
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,140
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's just a little bit further.</font>

94
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,040
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

95
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,940
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

96
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,770
<font color="yellow">Why did you tag along? Just go to church.</font>

97
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,840
<font color="yellow">She's so annoying.</font>

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,910
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,340
<font color="yellow">(Dear My Friends, Isn't Life So Beautiful?)</font>

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

101
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,470
<font color="yellow">There will be ghosts here.</font>

103
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,010
<font color="yellow">It has a good view.</font>

104
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,010
<font color="yellow">Of course. We walked up the mountain for 30 minutes.</font>

105
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,010
<font color="yellow">You're too old to walk up.</font>

106
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,210
<font color="yellow">Come on. It'll be good exercise.</font>

107
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,810
<font color="yellow">The bus comes up this way.</font>

108
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,270
<font color="yellow">The water pressure is good.</font>

109
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,770
<font color="yellow">No, don't get this place.</font>

110
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,070
<font color="yellow">It's further from me than my kids in the Philippines.</font>

111
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,470
<font color="yellow">I could ride on cars and planes to get there,</font>

112
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,110
<font color="yellow">but here...</font>

113
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,940
<font color="yellow">You asked me to find a place in your neighbourhood.</font>

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,810
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm looking at this place.</font>

115
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,010
<font color="yellow">Also, the Philippines is further than here.</font>

116
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,040
<font color="yellow">Why do you only look at the bad things? I like it here.</font>

117
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,210
<font color="yellow">I can't allow you to get this place.</font>

118
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,610
<font color="yellow">Sir, can you show us somewhere else?</font>

119
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,410
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

120
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,940
<font color="yellow">Wait, I have to put my shoes on.</font>

121
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,610
<font color="yellow">No, not this place either.</font>

122
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,410
<font color="yellow">This is a really good deal for 50,000 dollars.</font>

123
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,610
<font color="yellow">If it's that good, you should live here. I'll pass.</font>

124
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,640
<font color="yellow">You're not living here. Where are you going?</font>

125
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,070
<font color="yellow">Just live with me.</font>

126
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,340
<font color="yellow">Go home and stop getting in my way.</font>

127
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,270
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

128
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,240
<font color="yellow">I can't show you any more! That's all I have!</font>

129
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,910
<font color="yellow">Goodness...</font>

130
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,840
<font color="yellow">This looks tasteful.</font>

131
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,740
<font color="yellow">I used to live in a place like this when I got married.</font>

132
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,610
<font color="yellow">But you're not a mole. A basement house?</font>

133
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,110
<font color="yellow">Will it be too dark?</font>

134
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,270
<font color="yellow">You need sunlight when you're old.</font>

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,410
<font color="yellow">You'll get osteoporosis and depression.</font>

136
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,540
<font color="yellow">That's true, I need some sun...</font>

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

138
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,140
<font color="yellow">Pollack soup. Put in a lot of pepper powder.</font>

139
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,370
<font color="yellow">Sir. Can you help me?</font>

140
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,240
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

141
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,940
<font color="yellow">Not this one. That small one.</font>

142
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,440
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

143
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
<font color="yellow">Toilet paper.</font>

144
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

145
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,110
<font color="yellow">Bricks for decoration.</font>

146
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,740
<font color="yellow">I hope you get hit by lightning.</font>

147
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,570
<font color="yellow">What did Seok Gyun say?</font>

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,010
<font color="yellow">He wants pollack soup.</font>

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,640
<font color="yellow">What's all this noise? Go away.</font>

150
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,170
<font color="yellow">I haven't been yelled at in a while.</font>

151
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,240
<font color="yellow">You had a peaceful life.</font>

152
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,370
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

153
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,470
<font color="yellow">To buy pollack.</font>

154
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,470
<font color="yellow">When are you going to get the divorce?</font>

155
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,140
<font color="yellow">After I get a place.</font>

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,510
<font color="yellow">Don't make him the soup or don't get a divorce.</font>

157
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,510
<font color="yellow">You're so strange.</font>

158
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,710
<font color="yellow">You should talk to him before moving out.</font>

159
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,780
<font color="yellow">You'll shock him if you do this so suddenly.</font>

160
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,310
<font color="yellow">Let him get a shock.</font>

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,070
<font color="yellow">It won't change anything even if I do. It'll just be noisy.</font>

162
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,410
<font color="yellow">Did you tell the kids? They'll get shocked, too.</font>

163
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,870
<font color="yellow">I liked the first house.</font>

164
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,940
<font color="yellow">You should go. I'm going to take a look at it again.</font>

165
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,010
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for you at the three-way with the pollack.</font>

166
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,940
<font color="yellow">I think you could see Han River.</font>

167
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,940
<font color="yellow">Mum, why did you try to kill me?</font>

168
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,140
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

169
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,510
<font color="yellow">Hey, Joo Yeong. Where's your aunt?</font>

170
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,280
<font color="yellow">Professor Yang, you're really making masterpieces these days.</font>

171
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,440
<font color="yellow">There are a million stories for each photograph.</font>

172
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:58,110
<font color="yellow">I would buy all of it if I had the money.</font>

173
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,870
<font color="yellow">Do you want to sell it to me for half the price?</font>

174
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,940
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Poverty is what made me who I am today.</font>

175
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,640
<font color="yellow">Poverty for an artist isn't a flaw.</font>

176
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,840
<font color="yellow">I agree. People don't have such a philosophy any more.</font>

177
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,240
<font color="yellow">All they care about is money.</font>

178
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,070
<font color="yellow">These pictures are really great.</font>

179
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,510
<font color="yellow">If I had bidders,</font>

180
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,710
<font color="yellow">I would have bought that vase from you.</font>

181
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,940
<font color="yellow">It's Nan Hee.</font>

182
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,840
<font color="yellow">If it isn't about life or death, tell her to call later.</font>

183
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,640
<font color="yellow">She says you should call back unless it's about life or death.</font>

184
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,370
<font color="yellow">Her young professor friends are over.</font>

185
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,670
<font color="yellow">I guess she's less interested in her old friends.</font>

186
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,670
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

187
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,810
<font color="yellow">It's not about life or death,</font>

188
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,440
<font color="yellow">but tell her that old friends are important, too.</font>

189
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
<font color="yellow">(Yeong Won)</font>

190
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,070
<font color="yellow">Hey, Nan Hee.</font>

191
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,870
<font color="yellow">Buy me a drink.</font>

192
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,770
<font color="yellow">I can't, I'm shooting.</font>

193
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,270
<font color="yellow">Can we drink tomorrow?</font>

194
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Over there...</font>

195
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,540
<font color="yellow">I'm not off every day. Go back to work then.</font>

196
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,870
<font color="yellow">Why is she doing laundry? She should go home.</font>

197
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,440
<font color="yellow">Yeon Ha was perfect.</font>

198
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,810
<font color="yellow">Where did she go? She said she would wait here.</font>

199
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,610
<font color="yellow">Did she buy the pollack or not?</font>

200
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,140
<font color="yellow">You look like garden cosmos.</font>

201
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,840
<font color="yellow">Where did you come from?</font>

202
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,270
<font color="yellow">Where is your mum?</font>

203
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,470
<font color="yellow">Come here, come here.</font>

204
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,170
<font color="yellow">Try and catch me.</font>

205
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,340
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

206
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,240
<font color="yellow">How are you going to wait for me here?</font>

207
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,970
<font color="yellow">I'll be shooting until late.</font>

208
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,540
<font color="yellow">Get up and wait in the car. Come on.</font>

209
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,310
<font color="yellow">No, it's too stuffy.</font>

210
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,640
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

211
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,540
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, we're shooting!</font>

212
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,310
<font color="yellow">Coming.</font>

213
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,640
<font color="yellow">Go to the car.</font>

214
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so stubborn.</font>

215
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,870
<font color="yellow">Don't you know it's annoying to be an old, stubborn person?</font>

216
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,610
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Yes.</font>

217
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,070
<font color="yellow">- Get her a chair and a drink, okay? - Okay.</font>

218
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

219
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,270
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

220
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,370
<font color="yellow">I'm off to see Mum.</font>

221
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,610
<font color="yellow">Why go there when you know I'm waiting for you?</font>

222
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,810
<font color="yellow">I go wherever I want to regardless of where you are.</font>

223
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,540
<font color="yellow">Do I need your permission to see my mum?</font>

224
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,510
<font color="yellow">Since when did you care about me?</font>

225
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae?</font>

226
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,140
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

227
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,270
<font color="yellow">Is Hee Ja out?</font>

228
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,710
<font color="yellow">No, but she won't let me in.</font>

229
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,740
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

230
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,910
<font color="yellow">She can't keep a visitor waiting.</font>

231
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,370
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - Why do you think?</font>

232
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,640
<font color="yellow">You said you'd buy frozen pollack and wait at the three-way.</font>

233
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

234
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,610
<font color="yellow">"Oh dear"? You let your mind wander.</font>

235
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,310
<font color="yellow">- Where's the fish? - I bought that.</font>

236
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

237
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,370
<font color="yellow">On the way back,</font>

238
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,470
<font color="yellow">I noticed some flowers by the road.</font>

239
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,340
<font color="yellow">Then I saw a lost little puppy.</font>

240
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,240
<font color="yellow">It was this big. I followed it and ended up at home.</font>

241
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,770
<font color="yellow">I couldn't remember why I'd bought the fish.</font>

242
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,770
<font color="yellow">Do you know how scary it is when someone disappears?</font>

243
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,740
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you answer your phone?</font>

244
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,270
<font color="yellow">Is the battery flat?</font>

245
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,510
<font color="yellow">Keep a spare battery and your mind on you.</font>

246
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
<font color="yellow">Who am I?</font>

247
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,010
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

248
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,510
<font color="yellow">You're fine now.</font>

249
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,340
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you let Seong Jae in?</font>

250
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,510
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

251
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,440
<font color="yellow">Bye, Seong Jae.</font>

252
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,610
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

253
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,710
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

254
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,970
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

255
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,640
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

256
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,540
<font color="yellow">Why film me?</font>

257
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,610
<font color="yellow">Point it at the door to see if a stranger comes in.</font>

258
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:29,910
<font color="yellow">Take these and put the rosaries in a bag.</font>

259
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,540
<font color="yellow">The priest sent me.</font>

260
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,270
<font color="yellow">I didn't feel comfortable coming here,</font>

261
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,440
<font color="yellow">but our priest told me to check on you...</font>

262
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,340
<font color="yellow">and collect the rosaries you made.</font>

263
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,670
<font color="yellow">Apparently, some old people sell them and keep the money.</font>

264
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,010
<font color="yellow">I have to bring them.</font>

265
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,870
<font color="yellow">Are there 100?</font>

266
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,340
<font color="yellow">- I'll count them. - Don't bother.</font>

267
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,910
<font color="yellow">You don't have to.</font>

268
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,910
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

269
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,070
<font color="yellow">Do you like...</font>

270
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,440
<font color="yellow">not smiling...</font>

271
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,370
<font color="yellow">and saying the bare minimum as if we're strangers?</font>

272
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,940
<font color="yellow">If I were to leave,</font>

273
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,010
<font color="yellow">would that make you feel better?</font>

274
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,340
<font color="yellow">I'd feel less uncomfortable.</font>

275
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,040
<font color="yellow">Did I ask you to move in?</font>

276
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,810
<font color="yellow">Let's have fun. Not as a date.</font>

277
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
<font color="yellow">As friends.</font>

278
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,770
<font color="yellow">Rather than stay indoors all day,</font>

279
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:40,410
<font color="yellow">wouldn't it be nice to join me for a drive?</font>

280
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,110
<font color="yellow">And enjoy the sun?</font>

281
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,810
<font color="yellow">Jeong A can drive, too.</font>

282
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,710
<font color="yellow">We go out for a drive sometimes.</font>

283
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,840
<font color="yellow">You always have the last word.</font>

284
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,740
<font color="yellow">I give up.</font>

285
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,510
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

286
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,240
<font color="yellow">Did I give Jeong A the fish?</font>

287
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,620
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

288
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,790
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

289
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,760
<font color="yellow">This old man...</font>

290
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,050
<font color="yellow">He's her friend.</font>

291
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,390
<font color="yellow">And Jeong A's there.</font>

292
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,760
<font color="yellow">It's for the better. Seeing her alone upset you.</font>

293
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,450
<font color="yellow">Now, you just have to worry when the door doesn't open...</font>

294
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
<font color="yellow">for a whole day.</font>

295
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,220
<font color="yellow">Who comes first?</font>

296
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,350
<font color="yellow">Me or your mum?</font>

297
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,490
<font color="yellow">You, then Mum.</font>

298
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,550
<font color="yellow">And when our baby's here?</font>

299
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,950
<font color="yellow">You, Mum and the baby.</font>

300
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,490
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you if you put the baby before me.</font>

301
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,320
<font color="yellow">That will only spoil the kid.</font>

302
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,420
<font color="yellow">My mum said so.</font>

303
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,290
<font color="yellow">You mentioned her again!</font>

304
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,450
<font color="yellow">- Won't you eat? - No.</font>

305
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,390
<font color="yellow">It's beef.</font>

306
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,420
<font color="yellow">Have some.</font>

307
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,390
<font color="yellow">It's sirloin. It's nice and tender.</font>

308
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

309
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,260
<font color="yellow">Where are his manners?</font>

310
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,590
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the market early!</font>

311
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,690
<font color="yellow">Eat and let me do the dishes.</font>

312
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,390
<font color="yellow">What a fool.</font>

313
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,720
<font color="yellow">Chew slowly and carefully.</font>

314
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,720
<font color="yellow">You don't want to choke.</font>

315
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,920
<font color="yellow">Cough harder.</font>

316
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,250
<font color="yellow">You have a working toilet at home.</font>

317
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,090
<font color="yellow">At least something still works.</font>

318
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,250
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm not man enough?</font>

319
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,150
<font color="yellow">It was a concern.</font>

320
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,920
<font color="yellow">You could ruin a woman's life.</font>

321
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,990
<font color="yellow">Not so long ago, you couldn't even move.</font>

322
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,620
<font color="yellow">You only started walking...</font>

323
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,390
<font color="yellow">2, 3 years ago after spending 7 years in bed.</font>

324
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,750
<font color="yellow">Jacqueline might not like you.</font>

325
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,850
<font color="yellow">What if you spend 20,000 on her and she runs away?</font>

326
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,020
<font color="yellow">Isn't that what happened to one of your neighbours?</font>

327
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
<font color="yellow">You can't buy a woman's love.</font>

328
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,090
<font color="yellow">Jacqueline likes me, too.</font>

329
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,820
<font color="yellow">I may be disabled, but I farm,</font>

330
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,650
<font color="yellow">chop wood and plow fields!</font>

331
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,890
<font color="yellow">What? Can't a disabled man fall in love?</font>

332
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,050
<font color="yellow">In Bong.</font>

333
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,390
<font color="yellow">He's disabled.</font>

334
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,250
<font color="yellow">You told me not to marry a disabled man.</font>

335
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,650
<font color="yellow">So we broke up.</font>

336
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,420
<font color="yellow">No, I pretty much threw him away.</font>

337
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,920
<font color="yellow">I'm that obedient.</font>

338
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,550
<font color="yellow">In Bong.</font>

339
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,690
<font color="yellow">You can't communicate with Jacqueline.</font>

340
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,250
<font color="yellow">Don't give me the money, then.</font>

341
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,720
<font color="yellow">Just stop saying stupid things.</font>

342
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,020
<font color="yellow">I make a fortune.</font>

343
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,750
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's about that?</font>

344
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,190
<font color="yellow">You'll have children to raise.</font>

345
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,550
<font color="yellow">Mum and I have a lot of concerns.</font>

346
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,650
<font color="yellow">You aren't well.</font>

347
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
<font color="yellow">In Bong!</font>

348
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,950
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

349
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,550
<font color="yellow">I'm a super star.</font>

350
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,650
<font color="yellow">If it's about 20,000 dollars, you should have just called.</font>

351
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,590
<font color="yellow">Why would you come all the way here?</font>

352
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,490
<font color="yellow">You must have transferred at least three times.</font>

353
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,850
<font color="yellow">Well, you have to use your money for cancer.</font>

354
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,220
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

355
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,050
<font color="yellow">I have enough.</font>

356
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,250
<font color="yellow">Also, why didn't you ask Nan Hee?</font>

357
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,090
<font color="yellow">She's a boss.</font>

358
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,290
<font color="yellow">Does she not give you money?</font>

359
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,590
<font color="yellow">She does, but I need more.</font>

360
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,320
<font color="yellow">When In Bong fell from that telegraph pole,</font>

361
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,550
<font color="yellow">she worked so hard to save him.</font>

362
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,050
<font color="yellow">He had 12 surgeries up to 2 years ago.</font>

363
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,990
<font color="yellow">She spent more than 100 grand.</font>

364
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:28,290
<font color="yellow">She even made herbal medicine for us every season.</font>

365
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,750
<font color="yellow">On top of that, her dad goes to the emergency every now and then.</font>

366
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,790
<font color="yellow">What's the point of being a boss?</font>

367
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,120
<font color="yellow">We're wasting her money away.</font>

368
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,090
<font color="yellow">And I can't seem to die.</font>

369
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,720
<font color="yellow">Why would you die?</font>

370
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,090
<font color="yellow">We're not her mum, dad or brother.</font>

371
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,550
<font color="yellow">We're ghosts who steal her money.</font>

372
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,750
<font color="yellow">When I die, cremate me.</font>

373
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,890
<font color="yellow">You can sell our burial grounds and keep the money.</font>

374
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,820
<font color="yellow">Lend me your money.</font>

375
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,150
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Nan Hee.</font>

376
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,750
<font color="yellow">Once she gets nephews or nieces,</font>

377
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,850
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee will be responsible for them, too.</font>

378
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,450
<font color="yellow">That crazy fool.</font>

379
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,590
<font color="yellow">All he can think about is that girl.</font>

380
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,890
<font color="yellow">He's crazy.</font>

381
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,420
<font color="yellow">Oh, Mum.</font>

382
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,020
<font color="yellow">Why am I...</font>

383
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,290
<font color="yellow">worried about money all my life?</font>

384
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,190
<font color="yellow">Mum, take my car.</font>

385
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,590
<font color="yellow">I have a driver.</font>

386
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,320
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

387
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,720
<font color="yellow">Drive her home.</font>

388
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,920
<font color="yellow">Where's the eye?</font>

389
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,150
<font color="yellow">Good. The eye is the best part.</font>

390
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,250
<font color="yellow">Sure. It's the best.</font>

391
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,290
<font color="yellow">Why are you so nice?</font>

392
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,150
<font color="yellow">I nagged at you to clean the fridge...</font>

393
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,420
<font color="yellow">and now, you finally did.</font>

394
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,720
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to be nice.</font>

395
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,190
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

396
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,150
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time left.</font>

397
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,450
<font color="yellow">You're finally getting mature.</font>

398
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,990
<font color="yellow">Good thinking.</font>

399
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,920
<font color="yellow">We won't live that long.</font>

400
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,690
<font color="yellow">Let's be nice to each other.</font>

401
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,320
<font color="yellow">That's the best for a couple.</font>

402
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,850
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?</font>

403
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,650
<font color="yellow">To save you money.</font>

404
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,190
<font color="yellow">Great. You can lose weight, too.</font>

405
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,920
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

406
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,220
<font color="yellow">Yes, I called.</font>

407
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,990
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

408
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,150
<font color="yellow">Have this after you're done.</font>

409
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,390
<font color="yellow">It's good for you.</font>

410
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,850
<font color="yellow">I guess I'll live another 30 years.</font>

411
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,820
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me whom I'm with?</font>

412
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,390
<font color="yellow">I'm with the professors, of course. Why do you ask?</font>

413
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,920
<font color="yellow">What do you think I'm doing? We're having wine.</font>

414
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,320
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

415
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,820
<font color="yellow">You're having wine with young men.</font>

416
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,350
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja is making rosaries alone at home.</font>

417
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,790
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja has you.</font>

418
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,950
<font color="yellow">Do you still have feelings for Seong Jae?</font>

419
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,090
<font color="yellow">What if I do?</font>

420
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,520
<font color="yellow">You need to end it.</font>

421
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,220
<font color="yellow">They like each other. It makes sense for you to give up.</font>

422
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,920
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

423
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,250
<font color="yellow">Let Hee Ja hang out with Seong Jae.</font>

424
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,190
<font color="yellow">I go out while taking care of my kids' places.</font>

425
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,020
<font color="yellow">You also have your nephews while working at the cafe.</font>

426
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,150
<font color="yellow">You even have friends to drink wine with.</font>

427
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:01,750
<font color="yellow">But all Hee Ja does is watch television at home.</font>

428
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,690
<font color="yellow">She talks to herself so that she doesn't lose it.</font>

429
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,820
<font color="yellow">She must have been so bored...</font>

430
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,420
<font color="yellow">to make 100 rosaries in four days. Even young people can't do that.</font>

431
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,390
<font color="yellow">She has talent.</font>

432
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,150
<font color="yellow">Won't you let her have him?</font>

433
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,790
<font color="yellow">Are you upset because I'm asking you this?</font>

434
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,020
<font color="yellow">You should meet Seong Jae...</font>

435
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,090
<font color="yellow">in your next life.</font>

436
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,720
<font color="yellow">He'll see her again in my next life.</font>

437
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,450
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You should worry about your divorce.</font>

438
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,820
<font color="yellow">Romance</font>

439
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,290
<font color="yellow">For romance</font>

440
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,550
<font color="yellow">- Welcome back. - Are you here?</font>

441
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,090
<font color="yellow">Accounting book.</font>

442
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,250
<font color="yellow">You have all the receipts.</font>

443
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,990
<font color="yellow">This is for the burgers I had with Hee Ja last week.</font>

444
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

445
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,390
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

446
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,090
<font color="yellow">Thank you for buying my work.</font>

447
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,320
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it'll be worth a lot in time.</font>

448
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,050
<font color="yellow">At the ceramics competition last month...</font>

449
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,850
<font color="yellow">I know it won grand prize, but it's not that great.</font>

450
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,190
<font color="yellow">I prefer the one you gave me as a gift last time.</font>

451
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,690
<font color="yellow">You don't know how happy I am to have you as a friend.</font>

452
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,220
<font color="yellow">A friend?</font>

453
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,590
<font color="yellow">Be careful whom you call a friend.</font>

454
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,350
<font color="yellow">For me, a friend...</font>

455
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,990
<font color="yellow">is someone I can give up my lover to.</font>

456
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,550
<font color="yellow">A lover?</font>

457
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,590
<font color="yellow">I would've put up a fight had I been young.</font>

458
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,450
<font color="yellow">I decided to give him to her, who's older than me.</font>

459
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,090
<font color="yellow">Wow. If she's older than you, how old is she?</font>

460
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,350
<font color="yellow">Can she even walk?</font>

461
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,920
<font color="yellow">I'll pay for the taxi.</font>

462
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:13,950
<font color="yellow">Bye, now.</font>

463
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,420
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

464
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,450
<font color="yellow">Your young friend, Choong Nam.</font>

465
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,590
<font color="yellow">You cleaned the place spotless,</font>

466
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,090
<font color="yellow">but your place is always dirty.</font>

467
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,390
<font color="yellow">What's the occasion? You never do this.</font>

468
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:16,820
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I used to do this when I was young.</font>

469
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

470
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,720
<font color="yellow">I used to clean my room and do the dishes since I was six.</font>

471
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,250
<font color="yellow">I would even pick flowers so that you would smile.</font>

472
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,290
<font color="yellow">I used to do anything that would please you.</font>

473
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,450
<font color="yellow">It was after I grew up...</font>

474
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,550
<font color="yellow">that I stopped doing it.</font>

475
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,450
<font color="yellow">I miss those days.</font>

476
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,220
<font color="yellow">How can you miss that?</font>

477
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,520
<font color="yellow">I was so nervous all the time.</font>

478
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,620
<font color="yellow">I was scared you'd leave me...</font>

479
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,050
<font color="yellow">or try to give me drugs again.</font>

480
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,920
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep talking nonsense since yesterday?</font>

481
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,720
<font color="yellow">Leave. I don't want to see you. Also, Dong Jin...</font>

482
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,750
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

483
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,790
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved in my life again.</font>

484
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,950
<font color="yellow">What if I do? What are you going to do?</font>

485
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,020
<font color="yellow">What will you do if I do get involved?</font>

486
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,190
<font color="yellow">How can you look at me like that...</font>

487
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,790
<font color="yellow">for telling you to stop seeing Dong Jin?</font>

488
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,920
<font color="yellow">Is it that important?</font>

489
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,090
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I saw him?</font>

490
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,050
<font color="yellow">Is that my fault, too?</font>

491
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,420
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's your fault.</font>

492
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,490
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be reckless.</font>

493
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,690
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I broke up with Yeon Ha after living with him?</font>

494
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,920
<font color="yellow">You lived with him?</font>

495
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,420
<font color="yellow">I'm yours, so I can't do anything you won't allow me to do.</font>

496
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,390
<font color="yellow">You don't like the disabled, right?</font>

497
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,950
<font color="yellow">That's why I left him there when he got injured.</font>

498
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,290
<font color="yellow">You had a stroke then, so I had a good excuse.</font>

499
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:58,550
<font color="yellow">When I was six, in the field by Grandma's house,</font>

500
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,990
<font color="yellow">when you poisoned me.</font>

501
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,590
<font color="yellow">That's when I knew it.</font>

502
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,850
<font color="yellow">I belong to Mum.</font>

503
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

504
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,450
<font color="yellow">even though I'm scared, if she tells me to drink,</font>

505
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,850
<font color="yellow">I must drink it.</font>

506
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,950
<font color="yellow">It's your fault that I left Yeon Ha.</font>

507
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,020
<font color="yellow">I loved him more than anything,</font>

508
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,660
<font color="yellow">and once I left him, my inner voice said,</font>

509
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,990
<font color="yellow">"You cruel witch."</font>

510
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,320
<font color="yellow">"Live however you want."</font>

511
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,050
<font color="yellow">"Forget about your conscience."</font>

512
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,390
<font color="yellow">"Waste your life away."</font>

513
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,820
<font color="yellow">Say you're sorry.</font>

514
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,720
<font color="yellow">Say you're sorry!</font>

515
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

516
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,490
<font color="yellow">Am I yours? Just because you had me,</font>

517
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,450
<font color="yellow">does it mean you can kill me?</font>

518
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,950
<font color="yellow">Why did you do it?</font>

519
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,550
<font color="yellow">Why am I yours? Tell me.</font>

520
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,020
<font color="yellow">Tell me why you did it.</font>

521
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,520
<font color="yellow">Why am I yours? Why am I yours?</font>

522
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,520
<font color="yellow">Tell me! Why am I yours?</font>

523
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,320
<font color="yellow">Tell me.</font>

524
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,160
<font color="yellow">Of course, you are mine.</font>

525
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,490
<font color="yellow">Let go. Let me go! Let go of me!</font>

526
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,890
<font color="yellow">I hate it! I hate you so much!</font>

527
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,690
<font color="yellow">I wanted to die and couldn't leave you behind.</font>

528
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,690
<font color="yellow">How could I?</font>

529
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,750
<font color="yellow">- Stop it! - Die! Die!</font>

530
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,490
<font color="yellow">Die. Die!</font>

531
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,190
<font color="yellow">Die! Just die!</font>

532
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,720
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. I hate you!</font>

533
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,120
<font color="yellow">Please stop it. You can hate me.</font>

534
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,020
<font color="yellow">Now, I know everything.</font>

535
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,850
<font color="yellow">You can hate me. I don't mind.</font>

536
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,990
<font color="yellow">- Just don't do this. - Let go. Let me go.</font>

537
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,990
<font color="yellow">Please don't do this, Wan.</font>

538
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,890
<font color="yellow">Let me go!</font>

539
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,720
<font color="yellow">Wan, please...</font>

540
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,390
<font color="yellow">Wan! Wan!</font>

541
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,720
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

542
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,390
<font color="yellow">You're a coward, Wan.</font>

543
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,660
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring up a 30-year-old story...</font>

544
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,690
<font color="yellow">only to speak of it like a lunatic?</font>

545
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:00,950
<font color="yellow">You understood your mum then as you do now.</font>

546
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,020
<font color="yellow">So why do you blame her so much?</font>

547
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,820
<font color="yellow">You're the reason...</font>

548
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,660
<font color="yellow">I'm like this and broke up with Yeon Ha.</font>

549
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,890
<font color="yellow">I'm like this because of you!</font>

550
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,890
<font color="yellow">You're bleeding. Stop it, please.</font>

551
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,290
<font color="yellow">I knew it then.</font>

552
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of this.</font>

553
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,790
<font color="yellow">I couldn't forgive myself for leaving Yeon Ha.</font>

554
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,890
<font color="yellow">I wanted an excuse so that I didn't have to say I left him...</font>

555
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,590
<font color="yellow">purely out of my own selfishness.</font>

556
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,020
<font color="yellow">It was too hard to shoulder the blame.</font>

557
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,050
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to blame another.</font>

558
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,790
<font color="yellow">And the easiest and closest victim was my mum.</font>

559
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,750
<font color="yellow">Stop doing this.</font>

560
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,750
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

561
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,890
<font color="yellow">Wan, stop.</font>

562
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:57,050
<font color="yellow">I missed Yeon Ha so much.</font>

563
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,250
<font color="yellow">Japchae with noodles?</font>

564
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,620
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense.</font>

565
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,660
<font color="yellow">Just have a bite.</font>

566
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,090
<font color="yellow">You made way too much.</font>

567
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,550
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

568
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,320
<font color="yellow">I can't eat any more.</font>

569
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,050
<font color="yellow">Give it to your son.</font>

570
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,490
<font color="yellow">I don't do that.</font>

571
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,390
<font color="yellow">It's best for everyone if we see less of each other.</font>

572
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,120
<font color="yellow">They don't like me bringing food.</font>

573
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
<font color="yellow">Then freeze it and send it.</font>

574
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,820
<font color="yellow">I heard they don't like unwanted parcels.</font>

575
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

576
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,950
<font color="yellow">In case their parents are inside it.</font>

577
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,490
<font color="yellow">Did you make that up?</font>

578
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,990
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

579
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,720
<font color="yellow">Life for people their age is so tough.</font>

580
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,490
<font color="yellow">It gives them headaches.</font>

581
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,220
<font color="yellow">They regret it after their parents die.</font>

582
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,920
<font color="yellow">And use guilt to call it even.</font>

583
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,420
<font color="yellow">They're so cunning.</font>

584
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,020
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae.</font>

585
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,520
<font color="yellow">Bring your car over to Hee Ja's and take her somewhere.</font>

586
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,720
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

587
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,820
<font color="yellow">- What? - Didn't you hear me?</font>

588
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,490
<font color="yellow">Then forget it.</font>

589
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,160
<font color="yellow">What was that about?</font>

590
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,750
<font color="yellow">I'm letting you have him.</font>

591
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,950
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Choong Nam.</font>

592
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,320
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

593
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,220
<font color="yellow">You were going to go travelling. Were you flirting?</font>

594
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,490
<font color="yellow">That was just a split-second...</font>

595
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,820
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

596
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,620
<font color="yellow">I'm too old for that.</font>

597
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,890
<font color="yellow">It's weird if people our age go on a date.</font>

598
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,290
<font color="yellow">At our age, it's very possible...</font>

599
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,020
<font color="yellow">that one of us could keel over and die mid-meal.</font>

600
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,720
<font color="yellow">People our age can go travelling if they want to.</font>

601
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,590
<font color="yellow">We could die of something at any moment.</font>

602
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,920
<font color="yellow">What's so strange about going on a date?</font>

603
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,720
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with a trip?</font>

604
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:15,290
<font color="yellow">Burn the last of your embers before you fade away.</font>

605
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,120
<font color="yellow">It's totally understandable.</font>

606
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
<font color="yellow">Is it?</font>

607
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,690
<font color="yellow">But you said you like him.</font>

608
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,720
<font color="yellow">Not any more. He said he likes you.</font>

609
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,220
<font color="yellow">I fell out of love for him that instant.</font>

610
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,550
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

611
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,590
<font color="yellow">You need to pack for your trip.</font>

612
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,660
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

613
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,920
<font color="yellow">Take these.</font>

614
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,620
<font color="yellow">They're facial masks.</font>

615
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,350
<font color="yellow">Do you want to join us?</font>

616
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,750
<font color="yellow">That would be even weirder than if...</font>

617
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,550
<font color="yellow">the both of us ended up drowning in a saucer full of water.</font>

618
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,160
<font color="yellow">Are you eloping?</font>

619
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,450
<font color="yellow">In case of low blood sugar.</font>

620
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,520
<font color="yellow">Take half this much.</font>

621
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,350
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

622
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,550
<font color="yellow">I'm incontinent.</font>

623
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,950
<font color="yellow">- Adult diapers? - Move on.</font>

624
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,790
<font color="yellow">We wore these as babies...</font>

625
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,450
<font color="yellow">and again as old people.</font>

626
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,790
<font color="yellow">Life really blows.</font>

627
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,020
<font color="yellow">I need those.</font>

628
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,490
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Tell Seong Jae that you need to pee every hour.</font>

629
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,250
<font color="yellow">Tell him that's what girls do.</font>

630
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,690
<font color="yellow">If he refuses to stop the car every hour,</font>

631
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,350
<font color="yellow">call it quits and come home.</font>

632
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,890
<font color="yellow">I still think I'll need those.</font>

633
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,690
<font color="yellow">Even the gentlemanly Seong Jae will laugh at you.</font>

634
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,550
<font color="yellow">"Hee Ja, I'll carry that for you."</font>

635
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,990
<font color="yellow">Then he'll wonder why the bag is so light.</font>

636
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:03,020
<font color="yellow">When you aren't around, he will open it up.</font>

637
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:07,690
<font color="yellow">He'll be shocked if he saw half a bag full of diapers.</font>

638
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,950
<font color="yellow">This is why I don't want to go anywhere.</font>

639
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:13,420
<font color="yellow">Even for a short trip, I have to pack so much.</font>

640
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,890
<font color="yellow">It's such a bother.</font>

641
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,420
<font color="yellow">At least you can still walk. Think positively.</font>

642
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,920
<font color="yellow">Do you always sleep out here?</font>

643
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,520
<font color="yellow">I'm scared to sleep in my room.</font>

644
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,050
<font color="yellow">Aren't you scared of sleeping alone?</font>

645
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,090
<font color="yellow">I don't mind sleeping alone.</font>

646
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,520
<font color="yellow">I'm just scared I'll die in my sleep.</font>

647
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,250
<font color="yellow">The sooner the body's taken care of, the better.</font>

648
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,350
<font color="yellow">A corpse smells.</font>

649
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,420
<font color="yellow">It would be nice to have someone on standby at all times.</font>

650
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,290
<font color="yellow">You silly thing.</font>

651
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:54,190
<font color="yellow">You used to be so pretty.</font>

652
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,790
<font color="yellow">You were so smart.</font>

653
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
<font color="yellow">Sleep now.</font>

654
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,320
<font color="yellow">Wasn't I pretty?</font>

655
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,290
<font color="yellow">You still are. For a woman in her 70s,</font>

656
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,660
<font color="yellow">you're the best-looking.</font>

657
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,250
<font color="yellow">It's freezing. Goodness.</font>

658
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,390
<font color="yellow">It's still freezing. What's wrong?</font>

659
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:28,350
<font color="yellow">It's a beautiful day</font>

660
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,520
<font color="yellow">I think that's too dark.</font>

661
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,950
<font color="yellow">Liven it up a bit.</font>

662
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,690
<font color="yellow">You need to hide the wrinkles on your neck.</font>

663
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,450
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it feel nice to go on a trip with him?</font>

664
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,090
<font color="yellow">It's nice to waste...</font>

665
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,750
<font color="yellow">a day away.</font>

666
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:06,490
<font color="yellow">With the scent of platanus beyond its shadows</font>

667
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,650
<font color="yellow">I'm running with the dream of my youthful days</font>

668
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,920
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae, close the roof.</font>

669
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,390
<font color="yellow">Why? I like the breeze.</font>

670
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,650
<font color="yellow">I don't like it. Close it.</font>

671
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,690
<font color="yellow">Get some air.</font>

672
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,790
<font color="yellow">Spring breeze is like a scent.</font>

673
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,920
<font color="yellow">Just close it! Your hair-thickening powder is in my face!</font>

674
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,050
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's all over the place.</font>

675
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,420
<font color="yellow">Really? You're right.</font>

676
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,220
<font color="yellow">I asked you to close it nicely.</font>

677
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,490
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be like this either. I don't want to look senile.</font>

678
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,950
<font color="yellow">But the hair-thickening powder started to fly away...</font>

679
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,550
<font color="yellow">like flower petals.</font>

680
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,950
<font color="yellow">Why is the powder flying away?</font>

681
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,790
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

682
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,390
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

683
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,520
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

684
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:00,020
<font color="yellow">We'll go where Ms Park tells us to.</font>

685
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,020
<font color="yellow">Please drive slowly.</font>

686
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,850
<font color="yellow">She's telling me to slow down.</font>

687
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,990
<font color="yellow">Is there a curve up ahead?</font>

688
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,250
<font color="yellow">Ms Park is so nice.</font>

689
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,990
<font color="yellow">She has such a nice voice, too.</font>

690
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
<font color="yellow">For the rest of my life</font>

691
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,550
<font color="yellow">Underneath the grape vines</font>

692
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,450
<font color="yellow">A beautiful lady</font>

693
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,020
<font color="yellow">Wants to walk hand in hand</font>

694
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,190
<font color="yellow">Filled with the fragrance of grapes</font>

695
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,220
<font color="yellow">Food will be ready in five minutes.</font>

696
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,750
<font color="yellow">I have to go work on something urgent.</font>

697
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,090
<font color="yellow">The rice is ready. Eat before you go.</font>

698
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
<font color="yellow">Wan.</font>

699
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:21,620
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

700
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,890
<font color="yellow">Mum. Give me my computer.</font>

701
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:25,990
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

702
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,350
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

703
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,720
<font color="yellow">I was afraid you might not be able to make it.</font>

704
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,720
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's next Monday.</font>

705
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,920
<font color="yellow">You have to come for the memorial service.</font>

706
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,850
<font color="yellow">Even my dad's cousin is coming.</font>

707
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:53,390
<font color="yellow">You punk!</font>

708
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,290
<font color="yellow">You don't have to fish every day!</font>

709
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,350
<font color="yellow">You won't die if you miss a day!</font>

710
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,650
<font color="yellow">Do you know why your life is so rough?</font>

711
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:02,350
<font color="yellow">It's because you don't pay respects!</font>

712
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,120
<font color="yellow">Why should I take it back?</font>

713
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,750
<font color="yellow">Why should I? You punk!</font>

714
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:12,450
<font color="yellow">I won't live that long anyway.</font>

715
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,350
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do a huge ceremony...</font>

716
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,120
<font color="yellow">for my mum, assuming it's my last one for her.</font>

717
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,250
<font color="yellow">Last year was nothing.</font>

718
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,820
<font color="yellow">That's not even a memorial service.</font>

719
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,450
<font color="yellow">I was sick then.</font>

720
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,590
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do it properly this year.</font>

721
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,750
<font color="yellow">It's going to be huge.</font>

722
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:32,920
<font color="yellow">Yes, bring your wife.</font>

723
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,320
<font color="yellow">Bring your brother with you.</font>

724
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,990
<font color="yellow">The more the merrier.</font>

725
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,890
<font color="yellow">Why is he inviting so many people?</font>

726
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:40,890
<font color="yellow">See you then.</font>

727
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,750
<font color="yellow">He yells at me even if I get a little snack.</font>

728
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,220
<font color="yellow">Why does her memorial service get more food than me?</font>

729
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,350
<font color="yellow">She must be happy in her grave.</font>

730
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,590
<font color="yellow">Yes. That would be good. You have to come!</font>

731
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:53,590
<font color="yellow">Yes, Choong Nam.</font>

732
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,150
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

733
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:57,190
<font color="yellow">- That's good. - All right.</font>

734
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,390
<font color="yellow">- You're so nice. - Bye, now.</font>

735
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,490
<font color="yellow">What should I do for you?</font>

736
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:02,820
<font color="yellow">I'll do anything you ask.</font>

737
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,820
<font color="yellow">Just don't die before me.</font>

738
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,520
<font color="yellow">You have arrived at your destination.</font>

739
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,650
<font color="yellow">Your GPS will now shut down.</font>

740
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:50,390
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the washroom. Why are we everywhere?</font>

741
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,690
<font color="yellow">Where are we now?</font>

742
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,120
<font color="yellow">I only came to where...</font>

743
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,350
<font color="yellow">Ms Park told me to.</font>

744
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,420
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't trust her any more.</font>

745
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,990
<font color="yellow">She would tell me to go this way then that way,</font>

746
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,520
<font color="yellow">but she's making fun of me.</font>

747
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,490
<font color="yellow">What a fox. She only has a good voice.</font>

748
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:10,820
<font color="yellow">They say old people end up fighting with anyone...</font>

749
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,850
<font color="yellow">including ghosts.</font>

750
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,490
<font color="yellow">You're a lawyer. Why would you fight with a machine?</font>

751
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,050
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, can you hold it? Is it an emergency?</font>

752
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,050
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Let me turn the car around.</font>

753
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:23,950
<font color="yellow">Just go somewhere and do your business.</font>

754
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,650
<font color="yellow">Go and look.</font>

755
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,390
<font color="yellow">- Go away. - Okay.</font>

756
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,490
<font color="yellow">I should have never left home.</font>

757
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,190
<font color="yellow">I only have myself to blame.</font>

758
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,450
<font color="yellow">I got it! Hee Ja! We came the right way!</font>

759
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,520
<font color="yellow">We're not lost!</font>

760
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:03,650
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

761
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,530
<font color="yellow">There are a lot more grass than there used to be.</font>

762
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,990
<font color="yellow">Good. Ms Park was right.</font>

763
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,160
<font color="yellow">She couldn't possibly lie with that voice.</font>

764
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:23,590
<font color="yellow">I thought they would have built a bridge here by now.</font>

765
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,530
<font color="yellow">It's still the same rock steps.</font>

766
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:29,030
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, we came here before.</font>

767
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,290
<font color="yellow">We lied that we were going to church to our parents.</font>

768
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,360
<font color="yellow">We kissed here for the first time.</font>

769
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,160
<font color="yellow">We crossed over here.</font>

770
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:41,690
<font color="yellow">After that, we followed the road and went to a little hut.</font>

771
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,330
<font color="yellow">We should check it out. Let's go.</font>

772
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,760
<font color="yellow">What time will it be when we go home after that?</font>

773
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,960
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

774
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,790
<font color="yellow">Take your shoes off.</font>

775
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,790
<font color="yellow">It's slippery than it looks.</font>

776
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,060
<font color="yellow">We'll go home, right?</font>

777
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,960
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Should I piggyback you...</font>

778
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,330
<font color="yellow">like the old days?</font>

779
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,030
<font color="yellow">Get on me.</font>

780
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,660
<font color="yellow">Take care of yourself.</font>

781
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,790
<font color="yellow">Then give me this.</font>

782
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,630
<font color="yellow">It's slippery.</font>

783
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,990
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

784
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,030
<font color="yellow">The moment you slip,</font>

785
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,730
<font color="yellow">you'll be long gone.</font>

786
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,830
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

787
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,490
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me and worry about yourself.</font>

788
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:19,860
<font color="yellow">Watch what you say.</font>

789
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,830
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't you worry about me.</font>

790
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:28,360
<font color="yellow">My lower body is really strong.</font>

791
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:31,060
<font color="yellow">I could run over with my eyes closed.</font>

792
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,430
<font color="yellow">I'll piggyback you like back then.</font>

793
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,460
<font color="yellow">You're like feather,</font>

794
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,730
<font color="yellow">so it wouldn't change much for me.</font>

795
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,930
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't even know you're on my back.</font>

796
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,290
<font color="yellow">You're so chatty like an old lady.</font>

797
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,260
<font color="yellow">I should tap dance while I cross.</font>

798
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,890
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tap dance.</font>

799
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,560
<font color="yellow">That's refreshing.</font>

800
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,360
<font color="yellow">You should come on your own.</font>

801
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,060
<font color="yellow">I can't help you.</font>

802
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,860
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You'll slip.</font>

803
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,690
<font color="yellow">Hey, come over here.</font>

804
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,660
<font color="yellow">Let's take a picture here.</font>

805
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,160
<font color="yellow">- Hold on, let me take a breath. - All right.</font>

806
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,360
<font color="yellow">- You'll take it, right? - I'm dizzy.</font>

807
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,860
<font color="yellow">We need...</font>

808
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,590
<font color="yellow">to leave an evidence.</font>

809
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,090
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

810
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,890
<font color="yellow">- I'm dizzy. - Look. Look at the camera.</font>

811
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,290
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

812
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,390
<font color="yellow">One here.</font>

813
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:29,330
<font color="yellow">You have to keep turning.</font>

814
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:31,360
<font color="yellow">That's the point of taking selfies.</font>

815
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,960
<font color="yellow">- I'm so dizzy! - No, take it.</font>

816
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,330
<font color="yellow">You'll regret it later.</font>

817
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,360
<font color="yellow">I said, stop it.</font>

818
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,260
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

819
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,490
<font color="yellow">- Look here. - Stop it.</font>

820
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

821
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,730
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

822
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,630
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

823
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,760
<font color="yellow">No problem.</font>

824
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,260
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

825
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,490
<font color="yellow">Have a nice time with your wife.</font>

826
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,390
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

827
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,260
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, then. - Bye.</font>

828
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,960
<font color="yellow">The owner's dead, but the house is the same.</font>

829
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,890
<font color="yellow">Why are you chopping wood?</font>

830
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,630
<font color="yellow">It'll get cold.</font>

831
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:16,860
<font color="yellow">Did the owner tell you to?</font>

832
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,530
<font color="yellow">Are we leaving after dinner?</font>

833
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,930
<font color="yellow">We can't.</font>

834
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,590
<font color="yellow">I drove for five hours just to get here.</font>

835
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,230
<font color="yellow">I could cause an accident.</font>

836
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,090
<font color="yellow">People our age shouldn't drive for too long at a time.</font>

837
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,290
<font color="yellow">Hire a driver. That will do.</font>

838
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,960
<font color="yellow">Who would come all the way here to get us?</font>

839
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,890
<font color="yellow">Give me that.</font>

840
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,790
<font color="yellow">Who's this?</font>

841
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,530
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won, I'm in Jeongseon.</font>

842
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,530
<font color="yellow">Can you come and get me?</font>

843
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:54,060
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae brought me here and he won't drive me back.</font>

844
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,290
<font color="yellow">He says he's too old to drive.</font>

845
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,660
<font color="yellow">- Does that make sense? - It does.</font>

846
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,630
<font color="yellow">Old people shouldn't drive for too long.</font>

847
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,190
<font color="yellow">Spend the night with him.</font>

848
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:04,730
<font color="yellow">It was all planned like that time years ago.</font>

849
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:09,360
<font color="yellow">A man should plan ahead.</font>

850
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,530
<font color="yellow">People who live without a plan,</font>

851
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,990
<font color="yellow">that's just "que sera sera".</font>

852
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,230
<font color="yellow">Warm this room first. I'll sleep in there.</font>

853
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,190
<font color="yellow">There isn't enough firewood.</font>

854
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,760
<font color="yellow">Do we sleep together?</font>

855
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,530
<font color="yellow">The owner thinks we're married.</font>

856
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:28,030
<font color="yellow">He only brought one set of bedding.</font>

857
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,330
<font color="yellow">You should've said no.</font>

858
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:30,660
<font color="yellow">It would look bad.</font>

859
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:32,990
<font color="yellow">If we aren't married but travelling together,</font>

860
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:34,630
<font color="yellow">we'll look like cheaters.</font>

861
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,860
<font color="yellow">I won't sleep with you.</font>

862
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,990
<font color="yellow">It's raining hard tonight</font>

863
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:46,190
<font color="yellow">I'm sitting at a pier alone</font>

864
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:49,330
<font color="yellow">No one will come for</font>

865
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,930
<font color="yellow">It's raining, too?</font>

866
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,530
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

867
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:05,530
<font color="yellow">It is raining</font>

868
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,290
<font color="yellow">In my glass</font>

869
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:13,760
<font color="yellow">Tears fall with the falling raindrops</font>

870
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,630
<font color="yellow">Your beautiful smile</font>

871
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:31,260
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, look at the rain.</font>

872
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,590
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

873
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,690
<font color="yellow">That room is warm.</font>

874
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:41,290
<font color="yellow">Go and sleep.</font>

875
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,060
<font color="yellow">Look at the rain.</font>

876
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,030
<font color="yellow">Why won't you answer?</font>

877
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,790
<font color="yellow">You left the hospital after your accident,</font>

878
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,830
<font color="yellow">and I flew over to see my mum.</font>

879
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,630
<font color="yellow">But I'm still here, years later.</font>

880
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,630
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you say anything for three years?</font>

881
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:05,230
<font color="yellow">My mum had recovered,</font>

882
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,730
<font color="yellow">and yet I didn't return.</font>

883
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,830
<font color="yellow">I knew it all.</font>

884
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:18,860
<font color="yellow">What did you know?</font>

885
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:23,190
<font color="yellow">That...</font>

886
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:25,590
<font color="yellow">you had left me.</font>

887
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,360
<font color="yellow">Be honest.</font>

888
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,290
<font color="yellow">I abandoned you.</font>

889
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:57,860
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Very sorry.</font>

890
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,530
<font color="yellow">Today, I finally found the courage to apologise.</font>

891
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,590
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

892
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,330
<font color="yellow">Don't be.</font>

893
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,830
<font color="yellow">I miss you...</font>

894
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:33,530
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

895
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,530
<font color="yellow">Keep your place this clean.</font>

896
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,060
<font color="yellow">You don't have tea. Do you want some?</font>

897
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:13,490
<font color="yellow">I'll be going.</font>

898
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,360
<font color="yellow">Tea sounds nice.</font>

899
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,130
<font color="yellow">Herb tea?</font>

900
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:20,190
<font color="yellow">Herb tea.</font>

901
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:38,860
<font color="yellow">I'm glad the Dong Jin incident was a misunderstanding.</font>

902
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,390
<font color="yellow">You should just say you're sorry.</font>

903
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,990
<font color="yellow">- About Yeon Ha... - It wasn't your fault.</font>

904
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,460
<font color="yellow">I was selfish.</font>

905
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,990
<font color="yellow">I was scared.</font>

906
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,860
<font color="yellow">I saw you and Grandma suffer when it happened to In Bong.</font>

907
01:01:58,030 --> 01:01:59,190
<font color="yellow">I was scared.</font>

908
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,530
<font color="yellow">Your uncle wants to get married.</font>

909
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,060
<font color="yellow">He likes a girl.</font>

910
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:10,890
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

911
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:22,760
<font color="yellow">What happened with Yeon Ha...</font>

912
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,060
<font color="yellow">wasn't because of you.</font>

913
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,590
<font color="yellow">It wouldn't make sense.</font>

914
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,390
<font color="yellow">I would never listen to you that well.</font>

915
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,460
<font color="yellow">I lived with him without telling you.</font>

916
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,030
<font color="yellow">I was just making an excuse. Don't take it to heart.</font>

917
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,390
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

918
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:55,360
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for not telling you.</font>

919
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,260
<font color="yellow">It's better...</font>

920
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,660
<font color="yellow">than having a virgin daughter your age.</font>

921
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,660
<font color="yellow">I'm sure all mothers feel the same.</font>

922
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,790
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

923
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,130
<font color="yellow">Wan. You...</font>

924
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,090
<font color="yellow">Why are you being awkward? We fight all the time.</font>

925
01:04:07,490 --> 01:04:08,490
<font color="yellow">Just go.</font>

926
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:13,490
<font color="yellow">You should eat the crab while it's still fresh.</font>

927
01:04:14,330 --> 01:04:15,360
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

928
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:28,290
<font color="yellow">Right, Jeong A is getting a divorce.</font>

929
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,790
<font color="yellow">Isn't that funny?</font>

930
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,690
<font color="yellow">If I miss him,</font>

931
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,860
<font color="yellow">I should just go see him.</font>

932
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,590
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

933
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:21,790
<font color="yellow">Hey, when is my deadline again?</font>

934
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,660
<font color="yellow">The cover's delayed?</font>

935
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,530
<font color="yellow">Could you extend my deadline for five days?</font>

936
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,830
<font color="yellow">Taxi!</font>

937

940
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,430
<font color="yellow">(Dear My Friends)</font>

941
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:49,990
<font color="yellow">Hey, should I start seeing someone?</font>

942
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,690
<font color="yellow">Are you married?</font>

943
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,860
<font color="yellow">This was how we ended up kissing.</font>

944
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,460
<font color="yellow">She finally started her revenge.</font>

945
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,790
<font color="yellow">It's probably only the start of Jeong A's revenge.</font>

946
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:05,730
<font color="yellow">Soon Young! Jeong A!</font>

947

<font color="yellow">What if he faints when he sees me?</font>

948
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,390
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

949
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,290
<font color="yellow">You'd probably just leave like before.</font>
