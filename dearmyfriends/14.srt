102
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,540

104
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,740

130
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,570
<font color="yellow">I was thinking. She's always been a bit weird.</font>

131

<font color="yellow">You said she's normal,</font>

132
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,150

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

142
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,050

145
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,190

148
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,660

<font color="yellow">When I checked with the police station,</font>

151
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,240
<font color="yellow">they told me that there aren't any reports yet.</font>

152
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,190

<font color="yellow">She doesn't match the requirements.</font>

154
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,840
<font color="yellow">I reported her as a missing person with dementia.</font>

155
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,340
<font color="yellow">What do we do now?</font>

156
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,710
<font color="yellow">Everyone should just stay here.</font>

157
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,170
<font color="yellow">I'm going to visit the church.</font>

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,440
<font color="yellow">Sit back down.</font>

160
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,850
<font color="yellow">He's already got it under control.</font>

161
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,170
<font color="yellow">Let's just wait here.</font>

162
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,670
<font color="yellow">Go to the market and the grocery store.</font>

163
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,340
<font color="yellow">Your mum never goes to the market.</font>

164
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,140
<font color="yellow">"The nursing home is your second home."</font>

165
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,770
<font color="yellow">"If you must go, smile as you leave."</font>

166
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,970
<font color="yellow">"If I get dementia,"</font>

167
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,140
<font color="yellow">"always listen to Min Ho, Jeong A,"</font>

168
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,900
<font color="yellow">"Choong Nam, Yeong Won..."</font>

169
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,240
<font color="yellow">"and Nan Hee."</font>

170
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,300
<font color="yellow">"Read it three times a day..."</font>

171
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,800
<font color="yellow">"and memorise it."</font>

172
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,900
<font color="yellow">Unless it's with you, Hee Ja would...</font>

173
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,340
<font color="yellow">never go to the market.</font>

174
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
<font color="yellow">She gets things delivered.</font>

175
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,040
<font color="yellow">What's the point of staring at each other in the face?</font>

176
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,300
<font color="yellow">We'll only be annoyed.</font>

177
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,000
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

178
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,740
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset that Hee Ja's head...</font>

179
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,970
<font color="yellow">is so messy like this.</font>

180
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,830
<font color="yellow">Don't talk.</font>

181
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,140
<font color="yellow">Just clean.</font>

182
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ha Neul.</font>

183
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,450
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Her friends and her boyfriend is here.</font>

184
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,470
<font color="yellow">The lawyer guy.</font>

185
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's running around to sort it out.</font>

186
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,800
<font color="yellow">Of course, I'm fine.</font>

187
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,970
<font color="yellow">Ha Neul,</font>

188
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,670
<font color="yellow">don't stress yourself. You should be careful.</font>

189
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,570
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

190
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,240
<font color="yellow">That's what you should do for Mum, okay?</font>

191
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,350
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

192
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,370
<font color="yellow">Good girl.</font>

193
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,870
<font color="yellow">Don't tell your mum. She'll be so shocked.</font>

194
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,140
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

195
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm all right.</font>

196
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,400
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to check if she went to the market.</font>

197
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,740
<font color="yellow">I'll let you know if she comes back.</font>

198
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,610
<font color="yellow">She's not here either?</font>

199
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,640
<font color="yellow">Let's trying going on the route...</font>

200
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,630
<font color="yellow">from Nan Hee's restaurant to Hee Ja's place.</font>

201
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,000
<font color="yellow">What difference will that...</font>

202
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,770
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

203
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,770
<font color="yellow">do you think you'll find her like this?</font>

204
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,570
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

205
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,270
<font color="yellow">Officer Kim.</font>

206
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,900
<font color="yellow">I have a question.</font>

207
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,470
<font color="yellow">Are you still working at the city's road traffic department?</font>

208
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,770
<font color="yellow">One more bottle, please.</font>

209
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,110
<font color="yellow">Okay. One more soju.</font>

210
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,470
<font color="yellow">I should have never met you again.</font>

211
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,740
<font color="yellow">I caught the cancer from you. You're evil.</font>

212
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,670
<font color="yellow">When I was young,</font>

213
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,340
<font color="yellow">I wanted to drink at wonderful bars...</font>

214
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,500
<font color="yellow">like this while enjoying it.</font>

215
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
<font color="yellow">It's all ruined.</font>

216
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,300
<font color="yellow">It's messed up.</font>

217
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,300
<font color="yellow">Where's my drink?</font>

218
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,940
<font color="yellow">Doctor Cho called me.</font>

219
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,970
<font color="yellow">He says he'll schedule your surgery two weeks faster.</font>

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
<font color="yellow">He wants you...</font>

221
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,590
<font color="yellow">to have the surgery in a week.</font>

222
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,610
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

223
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,300
<font color="yellow">Did someone die in the meanwhile?</font>

224
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,900
<font color="yellow">You have cancer.</font>

225
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,670
<font color="yellow">You're the one who shouldn't drink.</font>

226
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,370
<font color="yellow">I have at most 4 months if I don't get surgery.</font>

227
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,670
<font color="yellow">Even if I get it, my chance of getting better is 20 percent.</font>

228
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,400
<font color="yellow">I might die while they're opening me up.</font>

229
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

230
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,770
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

231
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,940
<font color="yellow">- Here.
-  Are you done?</font>

232
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,770
<font color="yellow">She's an actress. She's my friend.</font>

233
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,140
<font color="yellow">- You know her, right?
-  Yes.</font>

234
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,240
<font color="yellow">Hey, give him your autograph.</font>

235
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,200
<font color="yellow">Be generous.</font>

236
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,140
<font color="yellow">Could I get your autograph?</font>

237
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,670
<font color="yellow">- What's your name?
-  Yoo Jae Sang.</font>

238
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,130
<font color="yellow">Tell your manager to go home. Let's go somewhere...</font>

239
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,240
<font color="yellow">for another drink.</font>

240
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,540
<font color="yellow">Let's sit here for a bit and then go home.</font>

241
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,170
<font color="yellow">I can't drive.</font>

242
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,500
<font color="yellow">You had one shot.</font>

243
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,070
<font color="yellow">Are you scared of dying?</font>

244
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,940
<font color="yellow">I think I'm struggling to live.</font>

245
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,770
<font color="yellow">That's the same thing.</font>

246
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,500
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to tell Wan?</font>

247
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,070
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to tell her?</font>

248
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,670
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.</font>

249
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,500
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter who tells her.</font>

250
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,870
<font color="yellow">It's the same thing.</font>

251
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,540
<font color="yellow">I'll do it then.</font>

252
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,870
<font color="yellow">Your hands are still so beautiful.</font>

253
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,540
<font color="yellow">It's not just my hands. My body is pretty hot.</font>

254
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,970
<font color="yellow">Who cares?</font>

255
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,000
<font color="yellow">No one is there to touch it.</font>

256
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,700
<font color="yellow">We both have it bad.</font>

257
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,740
<font color="yellow">It's really ruined.</font>

258
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
<font color="yellow">My life's ruined.</font>

259
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,600
<font color="yellow">I tried to live nobly as a good wife, a good mother...</font>

260
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,140
<font color="yellow">and a good daughter.</font>

261
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,770
<font color="yellow">I acted like I was strong.</font>

262
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,970
<font color="yellow">This is such a shame.</font>

263
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,390
<font color="yellow">If I knew this would happen...</font>

264
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,270
<font color="yellow">We should have just slept with any and every guy.</font>

265
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,700
<font color="yellow">Should we tell all the guys to line up? That we'll give ourselves?</font>

266
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,340
<font color="yellow">Watch your mouth.</font>

267
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,930
<font color="yellow">Even if we tell them,</font>

268
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,670
<font color="yellow">no one would line up.</font>

269
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,140
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

270
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,270
<font color="yellow">We're ruined.</font>

271
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,270
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won.</font>

272
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,440
<font color="yellow">When you got your first surgery...</font>

273
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

274
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,200
<font color="yellow">When you first heard the news,</font>

275
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
<font color="yellow">how did you feel?</font>

276
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,370
<font color="yellow">It was horrible.</font>

277
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,050
<font color="yellow">Then was the second time horrific?</font>

278
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,340
<font color="yellow">The third time was horrendous.</font>

279
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,300
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

280
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,070
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

281
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,300
<font color="yellow">You little piece of...</font>

282
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
<font color="yellow">Wan.</font>

283
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,600
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

284
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,230
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking down?</font>

285
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,960
<font color="yellow">Because I'm that frustrated.</font>

286
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,860
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't have jumped.</font>

287
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,260
<font color="yellow">She has that much sense in her.</font>

288
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,490
<font color="yellow">Dementia...</font>

289
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,090
<font color="yellow">doesn't come suddenly.</font>

290
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,360
<font color="yellow">It progresses slowly.</font>

291
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,730
<font color="yellow">My mother had dementia, remember?</font>

292
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,890
<font color="yellow">Didn't your mother have it, too?</font>

293
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,760
<font color="yellow">My mum died on the street.</font>

294
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,290
<font color="yellow">There was no medication for it back then.</font>

295
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,160
<font color="yellow">That's the first time you said something sensible.</font>

296
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,630
<font color="yellow">Where are your manners?</font>

297
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,860
<font color="yellow">Are you memorising the ten rules of a good husband?</font>

298
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,030
<font color="yellow">What's the first one?</font>

299
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,590
<font color="yellow">"A husband..."</font>

300
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,060
<font color="yellow">"should not vent his frustration or anger from work..."</font>

301
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,660
<font color="yellow">"on his family at home."</font>

302
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,990
<font color="yellow">You're doing well.</font>

303
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,190
<font color="yellow">Be good to Jeong A.</font>

304
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,860
<font color="yellow">Look at Hee Ja.</font>

305
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,560
<font color="yellow">One by one,</font>

306
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,330
<font color="yellow">we'll all die.</font>

307
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,660
<font color="yellow">Get in. Let's try another bridge.</font>

308
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,990
<font color="yellow">Come on. Eat up.</font>

309
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,390
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

310
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,400
<font color="yellow">It's cooked.</font>

311
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,830
<font color="yellow">Don't waste food.</font>

312
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,590
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

313
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,430
<font color="yellow">tell your brothers?</font>

314
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,830
<font color="yellow">Sort of.</font>

315
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,260
<font color="yellow">So they wouldn't worry.</font>

316
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,690
<font color="yellow">A sister-in-law has thyroid cancer.</font>

317
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,030
<font color="yellow">I said I'd call back.</font>

318
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,940
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

319
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,580
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. You have some.</font>

320
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,030
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have to drive.</font>

321
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

322
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,660
<font color="yellow">Your mother...</font>

323
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,160
<font color="yellow">will be fine. I guarantee you.</font>

324
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,030
<font color="yellow">If something terrible had happened,</font>

325
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,760
<font color="yellow">we'd have gotten a call.</font>

326
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,260
<font color="yellow">That's what happens.</font>

327
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,190
<font color="yellow">We haven't heard from anyone, so nothing bad has happened.</font>

328
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,910
<font color="yellow">I like and care for your mother very much,</font>

329
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,910
<font color="yellow">but we'll take time to eat.</font>

330
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,190
<font color="yellow">We need the strength to protect her.</font>

331
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,760
<font color="yellow">Does my liking your mother...</font>

332
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,860
<font color="yellow">bother you that much?</font>

333
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,590
<font color="yellow">Even if it does, it can't be helped.</font>

334
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,590
<font color="yellow">I like your mother...</font>

335
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,990
<font color="yellow">a lot, you know?</font>

336
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,160
<font color="yellow">But even so,</font>

337
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,390
<font color="yellow">we're just friends.</font>

338
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,060
<font color="yellow">Best friends.</font>

339
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,130
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

340
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,690
<font color="yellow">Now, talk less and eat more.</font>

341
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,330
<font color="yellow">Eat up. A man should be confident and strong.</font>

342
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,390
<font color="yellow">Eat up and cheer up.</font>

343
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,390
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
-  Okay.</font>

344
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,760
<font color="yellow">Hello? Yes, hi.</font>

345
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,430
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

346
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,960
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

347
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,000
<font color="yellow">I was killing time...</font>

348
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,210
<font color="yellow">at a nearby police station.</font>

349
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,960
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be right there.</font>

350
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,380
<font color="yellow">Stop eating. We have to go.</font>

351
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,120
<font color="yellow">- They found your mum.
-  What?</font>

352
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,000
<font color="yellow">Can we pay quickly?</font>

353
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,130
<font color="yellow">Pack this up. We'll come back for it.</font>

354
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,690
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

355
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,560
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Lee.</font>

356
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,160
<font color="yellow">Did you find my friend?</font>

357
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,990
<font color="yellow">Yes. Have a look at this.</font>

358
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,260
<font color="yellow">I traced the person you sent a photo of.</font>

359
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,330
<font color="yellow">That's her.</font>

360
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,960
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Hangang Bridge?</font>

361
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,660
<font color="yellow">What is she carrying on her back?</font>

362
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,760
<font color="yellow">That's it.</font>

363
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,960
<font color="yellow">We got too close today.</font>

364
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,860
<font color="yellow">How's the novel coming along?</font>

365
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,080
<font color="yellow">It's the first draft, but I'm 70 percent done.</font>

366
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me? You should be working.</font>

367
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,230
<font color="yellow">You're just delaying your departure date.</font>

368
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,030
<font color="yellow">You sound like an evil boyfriend...</font>

369
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,190
<font color="yellow">who abuses his lover.</font>

370
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,480
<font color="yellow">I need breaks, too. I'm not a machine.</font>

371
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,490
<font color="yellow">Here's your prize.</font>

372
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,190
<font color="yellow">Have this.</font>

373
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,630
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to die?
-  I'll eat it then.</font>

374
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,260
<font color="yellow">Here's your real prize.</font>

375
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,190
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

376
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,560
<font color="yellow">I'm holding myself up with my arms.</font>

377
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,860
<font color="yellow">I can't use my legs yet.</font>

378
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,760
<font color="yellow">But it's important to try.</font>

379
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,490
<font color="yellow">I'm always scared of falling.</font>

380
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,630
<font color="yellow">I hadn't tried this, but I started recently.</font>

381
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
<font color="yellow">For you.</font>

382
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,190
<font color="yellow">Get back to work.</font>

383
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,590
<font color="yellow">I can leave on this day.</font>

384
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,130
<font color="yellow">I'm waiting.</font>

385
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,190
<font color="yellow">(Off to see Yeon Ha!)</font>

386
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,690
<font color="yellow">My arms hurt.</font>

387
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,330
<font color="yellow">Let's hang up.</font>

388
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,090
<font color="yellow">Hang up.</font>

389
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,230
<font color="yellow">What? Yeong Won?</font>

390
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,860
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won, what brings you here?</font>

391
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,830
<font color="yellow">Why did you visit me?</font>

392
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,190
<font color="yellow">The doctor that Mum saw...</font>

393
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,790
<font color="yellow">Can I see him right now?</font>

394
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,290
<font color="yellow">Dr Cho. I'm really sorry,</font>

395
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,330
<font color="yellow">but could you meet with me right now?</font>

396
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,230
<font color="yellow">You're available?</font>

397
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,190
<font color="yellow">Okay, where should I go?</font>

398
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,290
<font color="yellow">Okay. There?</font>

399
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,290
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

400
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,260
<font color="yellow">Your mum already knows.</font>

401
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,560
<font color="yellow">She should know since it's her body.</font>

402
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,130
<font color="yellow">You said earlier that...</font>

403
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,760
<font color="yellow">60 to 70 percent of these people don't get surgery,</font>

404
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:48,000
<font color="yellow">and the recovery rate with surgery is less than 20 percent...</font>

405
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,780
<font color="yellow">Personally, I believe that they should get surgery...</font>

406
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,360
<font color="yellow">if there's even a slightest chance.</font>

407
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,130
<font color="yellow">20 percent is still a possibility.</font>

408
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,060
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to hear. It's possible.</font>

409
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,660
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Doctor.</font>

410
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,930
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go.</font>

411
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,960
<font color="yellow">Wan, I'll tell your grandmother.</font>

412
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
<font color="yellow">Yes, Choong Nam.</font>

413
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:39,230
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you pick up?</font>

414
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,730
<font color="yellow">I know you are annoyed with us,</font>

415
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,600
<font color="yellow">but we called because we can't get through to your mum.</font>

416
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
<font color="yellow">Wan.</font>

417

<font color="yellow">Hee Ja has dementia...</font>

418
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,330
<font color="yellow">and she disappeared.</font>

419
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,230
<font color="yellow">So tell your mum...</font>

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:01,930
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

421
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,360
<font color="yellow">I can't tell my mum that right now.</font>

422
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,490
<font color="yellow">So don't try calling her either.</font>

423
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,730
<font color="yellow">She has cancer.</font>

424
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,690
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

425
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,530
<font color="yellow">What did Wan say?</font>

426
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,960
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me right now.</font>

427
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,730
<font color="yellow">I'm dizzy.</font>

428
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,690
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

429
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,360
<font color="yellow">(Jeju Vegetable Store)</font>

00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,130
<font color="yellow">Sorry to call you so late.</font>

432
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,390
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can...</font>

433
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,130
<font color="yellow">go to your store for a while.</font>

434
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,730
<font color="yellow">I need your onions.</font>

00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,690
<font color="yellow">Can you prepare them for my restaurant and...</font>

436
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,060
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

437
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,360
<font color="yellow">My mum needs to get surgery.</font>

438
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,060
<font color="yellow">I need you to look after the restaurant for a while.</font>

439
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,390
<font color="yellow">I know it's busy. Hire someone.</font>

440
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,820
<font color="yellow">Can you also call the chefs today...</font>

441
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,730
<font color="yellow">and tell them that Mum's going to the hospital...</font>

442
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,570
<font color="yellow">No, don't hire anyone.</font>

443
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,030
<font color="yellow">Jeju Vegetable Store will have ingredients ready for you.</font>

444
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,160
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business what I have.</font>

445
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,730
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is listen to me.</font>

446
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,690
<font color="yellow">It's not because of money that I don't want to hire.</font>

447
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,030
<font color="yellow">If it was about the money, I wouldn't use expensive ingredients.</font>

448
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,730
<font color="yellow">I'd tell you to prepare the onions yourself.</font>

449
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,260
<font color="yellow">What will we do if the new person hurts themselves?</font>

450
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,960
<font color="yellow">Then what? Are you going to be responsible?</font>

451
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,760
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember what happened last time?</font>

452
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,260
<font color="yellow">Just do as I say.</font>

453
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,230
<font color="yellow">I know the inspection is next week.</font>

454
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,230
<font color="yellow">But I can't do it next week due to personal reasons.</font>

455
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,760
<font color="yellow">Could you come tomorrow to do it?</font>

456
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,630
<font color="yellow">There's too much frost in the freezer...</font>

457
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,260
<font color="yellow">and it freezes the stuff in the fridge.</font>

458
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,890
<font color="yellow">How can I cook with that?</font>

459
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,930
<font color="yellow">You'll come tomorrow, right?</font>

460
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

461
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,990
<font color="yellow">You should have agreed earlier. Goodnight.</font>

462
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,060
<font color="yellow">Stop with the phone calls.</font>

463
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,200
<font color="yellow">You made over 10 calls.</font>

464
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,300
<font color="yellow">Who will take care of the restaurant if not me?</font>

465
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,630
<font color="yellow">Pal Dal and Sang Sook will.</font>

466
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,490
<font color="yellow">What do they know? They only serve tables.</font>

467
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,930
<font color="yellow">Do you think running a business is easy?</font>

468
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,230
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Sang Sook picking up?</font>

469
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,860
<font color="yellow">She must be sleeping. It's 1am.</font>

470
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,360
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why does time go by so fast?</font>

471
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,190
<font color="yellow">Bring me my clothes.</font>

472
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,220
<font color="yellow">I'm already on it.</font>

473
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,660
<font color="yellow">You should've gotten it for me before I asked.</font>

474
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,400
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what I need?</font>

475
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,390
<font color="yellow">You never pay attention to what I do.</font>

476
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,230
<font color="yellow">I don't like it. I really don't. I don't like anything about her.</font>

477
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,080
<font color="yellow">What will you do when I'm dead?</font>

478
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,560
<font color="yellow">You'll cry at my grave and regret what you've done.</font>

479
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,760
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare do that.</font>

480
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,290
<font color="yellow">On top of that, you're old.</font>

481
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,530
<font color="yellow">Other kids your age have two babies already.</font>

482
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,860
<font color="yellow">They take care of their parents and also their husband.</font>

483
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,760
<font color="yellow">Where are my clothes?</font>

484
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,630
<font color="yellow">Do you need all day to pick out clothes?</font>

485
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,830
<font color="yellow">You could just give me this. This one.</font>

486
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,600
<font color="yellow">I really don't like it.</font>

491
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,260

492
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,230
<font color="yellow">I'll write down the numbers of my insurance representatives.</font>

493
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,930
<font color="yellow">Make sure you get the most out of them if something happens.</font>

494
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,390
<font color="yellow">Don't let them take advantage of you.</font>

-  It's just in case.</font>

496
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,260
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if it doesn't happen, though.</font>

497
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,860
<font color="yellow">I heard you already knew when you went to the hospital last week.</font>

498
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,430
<font color="yellow">We talked every other day on the phone.</font>

499
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,440
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

500
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,290
<font color="yellow">Would it have changed anything?</font>

501
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,290
<font color="yellow">What were you going to do alone without telling me?</font>

502
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,290
<font color="yellow">I was always alone! When was I ever with someone?</font>

503
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,290
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you yelling at me?</font>

504
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:28,190
<font color="yellow">Why are you acting nice? Is it because I have cancer?</font>

505
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,330
<font color="yellow">You always screamed when I screamed.</font>

506
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,730
<font color="yellow">What if I told you?</font>

507
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,860
<font color="yellow">And told Grandma? How would that help?</font>

508
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,190
<font color="yellow">I'm straddled with you forever.</font>

509
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,060
<font color="yellow">Will you suffer for me...</font>

510
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,950
<font color="yellow">or be operated on for me?</font>

511
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,960
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

512
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,330
<font color="yellow">I'm burdened with you all forever!</font>

513
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,450
<font color="yellow">I have a daughter,</font>

514
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:52,430
<font color="yellow">both parents and a brother.</font>

515
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,130
<font color="yellow">But I have to care for every one of them.</font>

516
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:58,590
<font color="yellow">Even if I were to die tomorrow,</font>

517
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,130
<font color="yellow">I have no one to rely on.</font>

518
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,860
<font color="yellow">Even now, when I have a date set for my surgery,</font>

519
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,130
<font color="yellow">I worry about leaving you.</font>

520
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,330
<font color="yellow">What about my parents...</font>

521
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,930
<font color="yellow">and your uncle?</font>

522
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:11,030
<font color="yellow">I can't stop worrying.</font>

523
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,830
<font color="yellow">Who said it's all on you?</font>

524
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,430
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

525
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,130
<font color="yellow">Who's your burden?</font>

526
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,590
<font color="yellow">Why am I a burden?</font>

527
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,390
<font color="yellow">I lived just fine.</font>

528
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,960
<font color="yellow">I'm in my late-30s...</font>

529
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,890
<font color="yellow">and you made me sound like a useless pack of luggage.</font>

530
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:39,930
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

531
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,090
<font color="yellow">Who said we're your burdens?</font>

532
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,430
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

533
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,990
<font color="yellow">I cared for them.</font>

534
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,660
<font color="yellow">Your grandparents and uncle.</font>

535
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,190
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who kept them alive.</font>

536
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,790
<font color="yellow">You're wrong.</font>

537
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,850
<font color="yellow">They lived this long...</font>

538
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,690
<font color="yellow">because that was their fate.</font>

539
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,890
<font color="yellow">It wasn't about you.</font>

540
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,630
<font color="yellow">If they weren't destined to live,</font>

541
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,430
<font color="yellow">they'd have died even if you prayed for them not to.</font>

542
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:21,190
<font color="yellow">Do you have to do this?</font>

543
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,830
<font color="yellow">Must you...</font>

544
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,230
<font color="yellow">make your only daughter...</font>

545
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,560
<font color="yellow">feel like a miserable piece of nothing?</font>

546
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,130
<font color="yellow">Do you feel better now?</font>

547
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,590
<font color="yellow">Wan.</font>

548
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,090
<font color="yellow">I try hard not to.</font>

549
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,960
<font color="yellow">Have the operation and chemotherapy.</font>

550
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
<font color="yellow">You'll be fine.</font>

551
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,130
<font color="yellow">Your doctor...</font>

552
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,490
<font color="yellow">He's the best in the world.</font>

553
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,630
<font color="yellow">The drugs are great, too.</font>

554
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,830
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared.</font>

555
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,030
<font color="yellow">It's so unfair...</font>

556
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:19,730
<font color="yellow">and I want to live so badly.</font>

557
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,130
<font color="yellow">I'm so scared.</font>

558
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,230
<font color="yellow">That evening,</font>

559
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,190
<font color="yellow">my mother, my refuge, fell.</font>

560
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,690
<font color="yellow">My mother, as powerful as the sea,</font>

561
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,390
<font color="yellow">failed to hang on.</font>

562
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,650
<font color="yellow">She cried like a child in front of...</font>

563
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:41,360
<font color="yellow">her daughter whom she didn't trust.</font>

564
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,460
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

565
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,390
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

566
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,360
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

567
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,230
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

568
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,240
<font color="yellow">You look like you're about to cry.</font>

569
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,670
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

570
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,930
<font color="yellow">You didn't say a word all night.</font>

571
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,960
<font color="yellow">Even after you woke up.</font>

572
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,630
<font color="yellow">It's not a serious operation.</font>

573
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,990
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

574
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,490
<font color="yellow">They're cutting her open.</font>

575
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,930
<font color="yellow">She's very sick.</font>

576
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,760
<font color="yellow">I know that much.</font>

577
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,330
<font color="yellow">Why else would she let herself be cut open?</font>

578
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

579
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,190
<font color="yellow">Did you tell her?</font>

580
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,330
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

581
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,570
<font color="yellow">Don't. She'll find out.</font>

582
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,890
<font color="yellow">What if she can't handle the shock?</font>

583
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,130
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

584
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,190
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

585
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,420
<font color="yellow">You have such grand handwriting.</font>

586
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,430
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

587
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,190
<font color="yellow">I heard about Nan Hee.</font>

588
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,090
<font color="yellow">Poor you.</font>

589
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:44,560
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja has dementia.</font>

590
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,330
<font color="yellow">Poor us.</font>

591
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,990
<font color="yellow">Come and eat.</font>

592
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,330
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, have some nurungji.</font>

593
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,960
<font color="yellow">No thanks.</font>

594
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:28,190
<font color="yellow">It's just the beginning.</font>

595
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,620
<font color="yellow">Old people have to eat.</font>

596
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,260
<font color="yellow">Have you given up on life?</font>

597
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,690
<font color="yellow">Do you all want to die together?</font>

598
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:38,660
<font color="yellow">Don't give in.</font>

599
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,460
<font color="yellow">I can't handle it alone.</font>

600
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
<font color="yellow">Nan Hee...</font>

601
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:44,760
<font color="yellow">Take some soy sauce.</font>

602
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,460
<font color="yellow">You should eat.</font>

603
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,030
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

604
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,630
<font color="yellow">I'm not afraid...</font>

605
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,390
<font color="yellow">of dying at all.</font>

606
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:08,690
<font color="yellow">I'll get to see...</font>

607
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,630
<font color="yellow">my husband, my eldest and the people I've missed.</font>

608
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,440
<font color="yellow">This is the last...</font>

609
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,160
<font color="yellow">we saw of her, on the outskirts of Seoul.</font>

610
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,860
<font color="yellow">She's headed towards Misari.</font>

611
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,290
<font color="yellow">Where could she be going?</font>

612
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,500
<font color="yellow">We will...</font>

613
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,260
<font color="yellow">call the Gyeonggi-do Police,</font>

614
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,130
<font color="yellow">but it'll take some time to locate her.</font>

615
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,390
<font color="yellow">Min Ho.</font>

616
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,660
<font color="yellow">He needs some air.</font>

617
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,630
<font color="yellow">When were you...</font>

618
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,960
<font color="yellow">the happiest?</font>

619
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,230
<font color="yellow">When I had my eldest son.</font>

620
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,560
<font color="yellow">Then when were you the saddest?</font>

621
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,560
<font color="yellow">When my eldest died.</font>

622
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,690
<font color="yellow">It was just a fever.</font>

623
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,160
<font color="yellow">We were living near my husband's home town.</font>

624
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,760
<font color="yellow">He was on a business trip,</font>

625
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:26,160
<font color="yellow">so I carried our son to the hospital.</font>

626
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,990
<font color="yellow">What is she carrying on her back?</font>

627
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,730
<font color="yellow">I carried our son all the way to the hospital,</font>

628
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,130
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

629
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,230
<font color="yellow">he was dead.</font>

630
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,960
<font color="yellow">I carried my dead son...</font>

631
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,730
<font color="yellow">along a road lined with trees.</font>

632
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,760
<font color="yellow">I walked...</font>

633
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,460
<font color="yellow">and walked...</font>

634
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,530
<font color="yellow">and walked.</font>

635
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,860
<font color="yellow">She walked and walked.</font>

636
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,330
<font color="yellow">Along a road lined with trees.</font>

637
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,290
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja's husband's home town...</font>

638
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,560
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, where was Hee Ja's husband from?</font>

639
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,360
<font color="yellow">North Korea.</font>

640
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:16,490
<font color="yellow">Was it Hamgyeong-do?</font>

641
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:22,190
<font color="yellow">51 Yangoh-ri, Yangri-myeon, Gyeonggi-do.</font>

642
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,430
<font color="yellow">North Korea is where...</font>

643
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,670
<font color="yellow">her in-laws were from.</font>

644
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,460
<font color="yellow">My first factory job was there.</font>

645
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:32,760
<font color="yellow">My factory...</font>

646
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:35,970
<font color="yellow">Was near the mountain at Yangri-myeon.</font>

647
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:40,090
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja lived with her parents there for 2 to 3 years.</font>

648
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:44,730
<font color="yellow">That's when Jeong A took my parents to Seoul...</font>

649
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,690
<font color="yellow">and lived here.</font>

650
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,660
<font color="yellow">I stayed at the factory's residency...</font>

651
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,030
<font color="yellow">for about three months. Do you remember that?</font>

652
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:54,510
<font color="yellow">I told you that I went to visit Hee Ja's a few times.</font>

653
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,290
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun, let's go.</font>

654
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,530
<font color="yellow">Let's try going there.</font>

655
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:00,730
<font color="yellow">I have a good feeling about this.</font>

656
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,460
<font color="yellow">- What is it?
-  What are you thinking?</font>

657
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,680
<font color="yellow">I have great memory.</font>

658
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,680
<font color="yellow">I know the place like the back of my hand...</font>

659
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,290
<font color="yellow">because they worked me like a dog.</font>

660
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,990
<font color="yellow">Min Ho, you should stay home.</font>

661
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,890
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere and stay here.</font>

662
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:23,660
<font color="yellow">Make sure to hold onto her if she comes back.</font>

663
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,390
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae must have an idea.</font>

664
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,680
<font color="yellow">- I'll call you.
-  Can I come...</font>

665
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
<font color="yellow">Ha Neul might give birth any day now.</font>

666
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,560
<font color="yellow">You should stay just in case.</font>

667
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,190
<font color="yellow">Wake up and focus.</font>

668
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:40,590
<font color="yellow">- Call me.
-  Okay.</font>

669
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,830
<font color="yellow">Don't forget.</font>

670
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,030
<font color="yellow">It's past Misari.</font>

671
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,310
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Buim Intersection is?</font>

672
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:55,790
<font color="yellow">You have to turn left there.</font>

673
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:58,430
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll turn left there.</font>

674
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,560
<font color="yellow">You should turn right.</font>

675
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,670
<font color="yellow">We'll go in a circle to go around.</font>

676
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,690
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

677
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,250
<font color="yellow">The neighbourhood is split between the high and low areas.</font>

678
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,260
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

679
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,430
<font color="yellow">The neighbourhood is split...</font>

680
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,710
<font color="yellow">What is she saying?</font>

681
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,230
<font color="yellow">You take the higher region.</font>

682
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,790
<font color="yellow">Let's just turn right.</font>

683
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,730
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying that now? I'm old, too.</font>

684
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,630
<font color="yellow">You should have said that before I tired myself out.</font>

685
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,850
<font color="yellow">It doesn't hurt.</font>

686
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:33,950
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

687
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,550
<font color="yellow">How can I eat when I'm sick?</font>

688
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,550
<font color="yellow">I'm glad.</font>

689
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,980
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's not cancer.</font>

690
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,210
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

691
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,210
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

692
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,850
<font color="yellow">It doesn't feel like cancer.</font>

693
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,410
<font color="yellow">Let's go on a trip.</font>

694
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,280
<font color="yellow">A trip at this point?</font>

695
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,080
<font color="yellow">What else would you do?</font>

696
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,110
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work?</font>

697
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:01,280
<font color="yellow">Can't you talk nicely?</font>

698
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,050
<font color="yellow">That's how Jang Nan Hee's daughter, Park Wan, talks.</font>

699
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,830
<font color="yellow">I'll just laugh it off. Where should we go?</font>

700
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,180
<font color="yellow">Wherever our feet take us.</font>

701
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,550
<font color="yellow">All right, let's do it.</font>

702
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,610
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can smile at my customers.</font>

703
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,730
<font color="yellow">Should we cash out? All of it.</font>

704
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,980
<font color="yellow">We can stay at an expensive hotel. Just you and me.</font>

705
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,210
<font color="yellow">A cheap hotel will do.</font>

706
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:34,710
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

707
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,780
<font color="yellow">even like your mum?</font>

708
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:43,680
<font color="yellow">Other kids cry when they hear about their sick mum.</font>

709
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,410
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sad when I have cancer?</font>

710
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,550
<font color="yellow">I look heartless, right?</font>

711
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,210
<font color="yellow">Just eat your food.</font>

712
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

713
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,290
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking?</font>

714
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,020
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering what you're thinking.</font>

715
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,920
<font color="yellow">I'm wondering what you're thinking.</font>

716
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,590
<font color="yellow">That's the first time we ever thought the same thing.</font>

717
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,360
<font color="yellow">Think of something that makes you feel good.</font>

718
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,260
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to.</font>

719
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,200
<font color="yellow">You said you're seeing a man, right?</font>

720
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,160
<font color="yellow">Think of him. Maybe it'll make you feel better.</font>

721
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,160
<font color="yellow">Shut your mouth.</font>

722
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,060
<font color="yellow">Everything you say is useless.</font>

723
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,320
<font color="yellow">I'm between life and death right now.</font>

724
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,810
<font color="yellow">If I think of a man right now, I must be out of my mind.</font>

725
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,160
<font color="yellow">You're crazy.</font>

726
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:11,420
<font color="yellow">Mum. Let's be friends instead of being a mum and a daughter.</font>

727
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:14,960
<font color="yellow">How do we do that?</font>

728
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:19,590
<font color="yellow">We can just talk about anything.</font>

729
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,980
<font color="yellow">Do you like me or him?</font>

730
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,020
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

731
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,890
<font color="yellow">- Did you sleep with him?
-  What?</font>

732
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,820
<font color="yellow">I guess you didn't.</font>

733
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:33,790
<font color="yellow">Since you slept with me and not him,</font>

734
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,420
<font color="yellow">I'll assume that you like me more. Am I right?</font>

735
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,120
<font color="yellow">Pull over.</font>

736
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,480
<font color="yellow">I'm going to rip off that mouth of yours.</font>

737
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,790
<font color="yellow">Stop the car.</font>

738
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,520
<font color="yellow">My sweet Nan Hee is so beautiful when she's mad.</font>

739
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,420
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Just drive! You'll get into an accident.</font>

740
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:56,180
<font color="yellow">How can a daughter ask her mum if she has slept with a man?</font>

741
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,620
<font color="yellow">I can't believe I have a daughter like you.</font>

742
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,820
<font color="yellow">I'm not your daughter. I'm your friend.</font>

743
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,520
<font color="yellow">Don't you talk about this with Yeong Won and Choong Nam?</font>

744
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,390
<font color="yellow">- I know you do.
-  Stop it.</font>

745
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,890
<font color="yellow">You leave me speechless.</font>

746
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,160
<font color="yellow">How can a daughter ask her mum if she has slept with a man?</font>

747
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,720
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

748
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,360
<font color="yellow">Don't act so innocent.</font>

749
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,260
<font color="yellow">I think it's around here.</font>

750
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,620
<font color="yellow">I think it was nearby these trees.</font>

751
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,420
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja told me to come over when she lived here.</font>

752
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,300
<font color="yellow">I never did.</font>

753
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:53,760
<font color="yellow">We have a car now, but we didn't back then.</font>

754
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,220
<font color="yellow">When I was here,</font>

755
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,110
<font color="yellow">you and I couldn't see each other for three months.</font>

756
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,290
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to see Hee Ja for two years then.</font>

757
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,120
<font color="yellow">It's a beautiful road.</font>

758
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,590
<font color="yellow">It sure is. It's nice.</font>

759
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,490
<font color="yellow">I don't think I came through this way.</font>

760
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,360
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

761
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,390
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

762
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,820
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

763
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:47,720
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae, I'll go.</font>

764
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,220
<font color="yellow">You should call Min Ho.</font>

765
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:03,920
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

766
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,220
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here?
-  Hee Ja.</font>

767
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,660
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

768
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:19,620
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja. Hee Ja.</font>

769
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,260
<font color="yellow">- Hee Ja.
-  Why are you here?</font>

770
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,020
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

771
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,020
<font color="yellow">I hate you. How dare you come here?</font>

772
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,560
<font color="yellow">- How dare you?
-  Hee Ja.</font>

773
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,420
<font color="yellow">- It's me, Jeong A.
-  Hee Ja.</font>

774
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,520
<font color="yellow">- It's me, Jeong A.
-  Stop.</font>

775
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,860
<font color="yellow">I hope you die!</font>

776
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,760
<font color="yellow">- Hee Ja. Hee Ja.
-  What's wrong?</font>

777
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,990
<font color="yellow">You wretch.</font>

778
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:43,220
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

779
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:47,020
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, wake up.</font>

780
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
<font color="yellow">I called you.</font>

781
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:57,560
<font color="yellow">I asked you to help me with my sick son.</font>

782
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,120
<font color="yellow">I told you his fever won't go down even with the medication.</font>

783
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,560
<font color="yellow">I asked you to help. I was scared.</font>

784
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:08,570
<font color="yellow">Why is everything always so hard for you?</font>

785
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:12,990
<font color="yellow">You're never there when I need you the most.</font>

786
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,320
<font color="yellow">I couldn't reach my husband.</font>

787
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,800
<font color="yellow">Do you know how scared I was all night?</font>

788
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,760
<font color="yellow">When I finally called you, you said,</font>

789
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:28,460
<font color="yellow">"It's hard for me as it is! Stop whining!"</font>

790
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,020
<font color="yellow">And then you hung up.</font>

791
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,590
<font color="yellow">You were all I had.</font>

792
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,990
<font color="yellow">Why were you always having a hard time?</font>

793
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,610
<font color="yellow">You're always struggling.</font>

794
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:48,820
<font color="yellow">I could never call and tell you how I was doing.</font>

795
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,860
<font color="yellow">Bring my son back. Bring him back, you witch.</font>

796
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:58,390
<font color="yellow">You're a witch. You aren't even a friend!</font>

797
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,820
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

798
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:02,990
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

799
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:05,160
<font color="yellow">We all wronged you.</font>

800
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,110
<font color="yellow">We're sorry.</font>

801
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,490
<font color="yellow">I hate you all.</font>

802
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,290
<font color="yellow">My son...</font>

803
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,060
<font color="yellow">died on my back.</font>

804
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,820
<font color="yellow">My son died on my back...</font>

805
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,860
<font color="yellow">Please stop, Hee Ja.</font>

806
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,690
<font color="yellow">My baby...</font>

807
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:53,960
<font color="yellow">My baby...</font>

808
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,590
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to bury me somewhere.</font>

809
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,720
<font color="yellow">Wait here.</font>

810
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,530
<font color="yellow">What lovely service.</font>

811
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,390
<font color="yellow">This is just the beginning.</font>

812
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,420
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

813
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,500
<font color="yellow">- Give me that.
-  No.</font>

814
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,060
<font color="yellow">I'm not in pain. You can carry things for me when I'm weak.</font>

815
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,760
<font color="yellow">What do we do now to kill time?</font>

816
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:20,060
<font color="yellow">We look at each other.</font>

817
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,660
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

818
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,420
<font color="yellow">Sing a song.</font>

819
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,070
<font color="yellow">You used to sing a lot when you were little.</font>

820
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:28,120
<font color="yellow">I'm sober.</font>

821
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,520
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

822
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,910
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

823
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,570
<font color="yellow">I brought it from home.</font>

824
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,390
<font color="yellow">It's all for you.</font>

825
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:43,440
<font color="yellow">I see. You aren't allowed to drink,</font>

826
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,860
<font color="yellow">so you'll feed me?</font>

827
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:47,260
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

828
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,560
<font color="yellow">Will you look at that go down?</font>

829
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,400
<font color="yellow">What shall we sing?</font>

830
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,490
<font color="yellow">That song.</font>

831
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,860
<font color="yellow">This one.</font>

832
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,590
<font color="yellow">Oh, your favourite?</font>

833
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:12,260
<font color="yellow">(The Name tag of Love)</font>

834
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,460
<font color="yellow">Stick a name tag on my heart</font>

835
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:22,560
<font color="yellow">Seal it with your love</font>

836
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:26,590
<font color="yellow">Tell me you'll love me until the end of the world</font>

837
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:29,990
<font color="yellow">Stake your claim on me</font>

838
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,130
<font color="yellow">Love is like a glass ball that easily breaks</font>

839
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:38,620
<font color="yellow">Love hurts</font>

840
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,890
<font color="yellow">I gave you my affection, my heart and my love</font>

841
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,220
<font color="yellow">We can no longer live like strangers</font>

842
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,260
<font color="yellow">I love only you</font>

843
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:55,390
<font color="yellow">So put your name tag on me</font>

844
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:00,990
<font color="yellow">Stick a name tag on my heart</font>

845
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:05,260
<font color="yellow">Seal it with your love</font>

846
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:09,290
<font color="yellow">Tell me you'll love me until the end of the world</font>

847
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,620
<font color="yellow">Stake your claim on me</font>

848
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,190
<font color="yellow">Don't regret losing me once I'm gone</font>

849
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:21,390
<font color="yellow">Love hurts</font>

850
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:44,160
<font color="yellow">Wait here. Don't go anywhere.</font>

851
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,420
<font color="yellow">You got your senses back.</font>

852
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:02,190
<font color="yellow">I'll come by tomorrow.</font>

853
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,190
<font color="yellow">She's fine. She's just embarrassed.</font>

854
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,410
<font color="yellow">Go home. Come back tomorrow.</font>

855
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:17,720
<font color="yellow">Stay with us.</font>

856
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,360
<font color="yellow">You're old, too.</font>

857
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,160
<font color="yellow">You don't have the energy to go all the way home and back.</font>

858
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,460
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

859
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:28,060
<font color="yellow">Seong Jae, I'll spend the night at Jeong A's.</font>

860
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,090
<font color="yellow">You didn't even smile at me.</font>

861
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,260
<font color="yellow">Where's your wife?</font>

862
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,290
<font color="yellow">Eating chicken with her mum, I guess.</font>

863
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:32,120
<font color="yellow">I will get help.</font>

864
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:34,590
<font color="yellow">So go home.</font>

865
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,590
<font color="yellow">I'm going to live here.</font>

866
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,490
<font color="yellow">No. Why would you live with me?</font>

867
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:42,690
<font color="yellow">You're married. Live with your wife.</font>

868
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:48,090
<font color="yellow">The doctor said that...</font>

869
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:50,690
<font color="yellow">delusional disorder isn't dementia.</font>

870
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,030
<font color="yellow">I just need to take my pills.</font>

871
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,620
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

872
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,620
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to do that now.</font>

873
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:09,060
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

874
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,860
<font color="yellow">I'll get dementia if I don't take my pills.</font>

875
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:20,390
<font color="yellow">I forget to take it sometimes, that's why.</font>

876
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,460
<font color="yellow">I'll see a doctor tomorrow.</font>

877
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,720
<font color="yellow">You can go home.</font>

878
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,890
<font color="yellow">Let's live separately like we do now.</font>

879
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:36,490
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

880
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,720
<font color="yellow">Shall we watch a movie?</font>

881
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:41,690
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy.</font>

882
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:46,790
<font color="yellow">Let's sleep, then.</font>

883
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,030
<font color="yellow">I'm sleepy, too.</font>

884
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:37,800
<font color="yellow">Mum. Mum.</font>

885
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,090
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
-  Mum.</font>

886
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,220
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong with you?
-  Mum.</font>

887
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,220
<font color="yellow">You only had one bottle. Why are you drunk?</font>

888
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,590
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn this?</font>

889
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:48,860
<font color="yellow">From a guy.</font>

890
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,630
<font color="yellow">Go and pee.</font>

891
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:53,220
<font color="yellow">I don't have to go any more.</font>

892
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,220
<font color="yellow">Kiss me.</font>

893
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,840
<font color="yellow">Go and throw up to get sober.</font>

894
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,320
<font color="yellow">Are you scared that I'll be a bad drunk?</font>

895
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:01,790
<font color="yellow">Stand up straight.</font>

896
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,390
<font color="yellow">I'm not drunk.</font>

897
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,920
<font color="yellow">Can you clean up the table? I'll go pee.</font>

898
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:19,360
<font color="yellow">She's stupid and crazy.</font>

899
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,120
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

900
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:37,860
<font color="yellow">What was what?</font>

901
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,620
<font color="yellow">I didn't hear anything.</font>

902
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:43,590
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

903
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:47,890
<font color="yellow">Can you sing me that song?</font>

904
01:13:49,790 --> 01:13:50,940
<font color="yellow">"Old Poet's Song".</font>

905
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:53,790
<font color="yellow">Are you asking me to sing while you pee?</font>

906
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:56,490
<font color="yellow">You're my daughter, but you're so weird.</font>

907
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:58,360
<font color="yellow">I have cancer, come on.</font>

908
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,030
<font color="yellow">Sing it for me.</font>

909
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,620
<font color="yellow">A small leaf</font>

910
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,030
<font color="yellow">Falls from</font>

911
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,420
<font color="yellow">A dry branch</font>

912
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:35,390
<font color="yellow">Even if you were</font>

913
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:37,810
<font color="yellow">A tree</font>

914
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,890
<font color="yellow">When I heard about Mum's cancer from Yeong Won,</font>

915
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,820
<font color="yellow">I finally saw how selfish I am.</font>

916
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,920
<font color="yellow">Instead of worrying about her,</font>

917
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,290
<font color="yellow">I worried about myself...</font>

918
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:50,890
<font color="yellow">and what I should do...</font>

919
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,490
<font color="yellow">with Yeon Ha.</font>

920
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:58,090
<font color="yellow">If you don't come,</font>

921
01:14:59,490 --> 01:15:00,690
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you.</font>

922
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,660
<font color="yellow">All I worried about was myself.</font>

923
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:15,820
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is,</font>

924
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,160
<font color="yellow">Jang Nan Hee's daughter, Park Wan...</font>

925
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:23,530
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

926
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,030
<font color="yellow">Every child in this world...</font>

927
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:30,720
<font color="yellow">doesn't have the right to shed a tear.</font>

928
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,760
<font color="yellow">We're all shamelessly selfish.</font>
