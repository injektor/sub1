<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

159
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,820
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she ran away from home?</font>

160
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,020
<font color="yellow">Here's your pillow.</font>

161
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,790
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

162
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,090
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight.</font>

163
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,590
<font color="yellow">(Ho Young)</font>

164
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,050
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.</font>

165
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,950
<font color="yellow">How much?</font>

166
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,530
<font color="yellow">I'm really sorry.</font>

167
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,290
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you'd be sick.</font>

168
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,140
<font color="yellow">We really won't go to karaoke any more.</font>

169
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,690
<font color="yellow">You can go.</font>

170
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,650
<font color="yellow">But you have to pick up your phone.</font>

171
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,020
<font color="yellow">An old person can get sick at any moment.</font>

172
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,090
<font color="yellow">I won't give you the cafe. Get lost.</font>

173
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,260
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

174
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,590
<font color="yellow">- Aunt...
- Let go.</font>

175
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,420
<font color="yellow">You jerks.</font>

176
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,550
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you all.</font>

177
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,190
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun.</font>

178
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,020
<font color="yellow">Will you lay out the spoons and chopsticks?</font>

179
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,850
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

181
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,190
<font color="yellow">Get your rice.</font>

182
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,390
<font color="yellow">How does this work?</font>

183
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,120
<font color="yellow">Oh, I got it.</font>

184
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,920
<font color="yellow">Do you eat red rice?</font>

185
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,620
<font color="yellow">We do, too.</font>

186
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,120
<font color="yellow">Eat a lot of it. It's good for you.</font>

187
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,090
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun.</font>

188
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,160
<font color="yellow">Go and beg for forgiveness.</font>

189
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,080
<font color="yellow">Ask her to come home.</font>

190
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,090
<font color="yellow">What for?</font>

191
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,690
<font color="yellow">She'll be back in three days.</font>

192
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,720
<font color="yellow">She'll come back by the time I finish all the soup and rice.</font>

193
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,210
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam is right.</font>

194
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,320
<font color="yellow">If she really did want to leave me,</font>

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,620
<font color="yellow">why would she have cooked me food?</font>

196
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,250
<font color="yellow">It's because that's what she's like.</font>

197
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,780
<font color="yellow">- What?
- She's a good person.</font>

198
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,340
<font color="yellow">It's your last feast.</font>

199
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
<font color="yellow">"Eat the rice and soup,"</font>

200
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,850
<font color="yellow">"and stay away for the rest of my life."</font>

201
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,420
<font color="yellow">That's what she means.</font>

202
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,280
<font color="yellow">She's that sweet.</font>

203
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,490
<font color="yellow">Where are the divorce papers then?</font>

204
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,720
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right? I got you there.</font>

205
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,990
<font color="yellow">My wife will never,</font>

206
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,140
<font color="yellow">ever divorce me.</font>

207
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,700
<font color="yellow">We were married for half a century.</font>

208
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,320
<font color="yellow">You may think that...</font>

209
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,130
<font color="yellow">I'm a jerk, but I'm not.</font>

210
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,550
<font color="yellow">I'm a great husband. I support us...</font>

211
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,690
<font color="yellow">and never had an affair.</font>

212
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,290
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

213
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,790
<font color="yellow">Jeong A...</font>

214
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
<font color="yellow">rented a house.</font>

215
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,180
<font color="yellow">That's for show.</font>

216
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,720
<font color="yellow">She wanted me to take her around the world,</font>

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,800
<font color="yellow">so this is her complaining.</font>

218
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,150
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
<font color="yellow">Humans now...</font>

220
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,070
<font color="yellow">can live for 100 years.</font>

221
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,880
<font color="yellow">Let's say we blow our savings on a round-the-world trip.</font>

222
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,170
<font color="yellow">What will we do for the rest of our lives?</font>

223
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,490
<font color="yellow">Should we become a homeless couple at our age?</font>

224
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,610
<font color="yellow">You're a lawyer...</font>

225
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,790
<font color="yellow">and your parents were rich.</font>

226
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,820
<font color="yellow">Do you have 10 million dollars?</font>

227
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,720
<font color="yellow">You act like it's an easy sum to come by.</font>

228
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,940
<font color="yellow">My parents spent all their savings...</font>

229
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,500
<font color="yellow">on their medical bills before they died.</font>

230
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,190
<font color="yellow">I'm no fraud. I'm a lawyer.</font>

231
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,620
<font color="yellow">No one can earn that much...</font>

232
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,390
<font color="yellow">working an average job.</font>

233
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,850
<font color="yellow">You're useless then.</font>

234
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,720
<font color="yellow">I'd have earned that much...</font>

235
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,900
<font color="yellow">if I'd gone to college.</font>

236
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,650
<font color="yellow">I bet I could've earned 20 million, even.</font>

237
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,690
<font color="yellow">You're a good cook.</font>

238
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,390
<font color="yellow">You're better than Jeong A.</font>

239
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
<font color="yellow">Shall I move in?</font>

240
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,090
<font color="yellow">Are you impressed?</font>

241
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:51,090
<font color="yellow">No, no. Wash your hands now.</font>

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,350
<font color="yellow">Wash your hands.</font>

243
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,590
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

244
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

245
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,990
<font color="yellow">Smell them.</font>

246
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
<font color="yellow">Let's drink.</font>

247
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,590
<font color="yellow">You have liquor.</font>

248
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,590
<font color="yellow">You can unearth some new talents there.</font>

249
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,490
<font color="yellow">The staff here are quite capable.</font>

250
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
<font color="yellow">Was Yeon Ha...</font>

251
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,890
<font color="yellow">pleased to see you?</font>

252
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,950
<font color="yellow">I thought he would be.</font>

253
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,290
<font color="yellow">- But he played hard to get.
- What?</font>

254
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,120
<font color="yellow">He said he's fine.</font>

255
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,950
<font color="yellow">His life is perfect,</font>

256
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,090
<font color="yellow">so he doesn't care.</font>

257
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,890
<font color="yellow">He's always so cool.</font>

258
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
<font color="yellow">And your mum?</font>

259
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,750
<font color="yellow">She'll be fine.</font>

260
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,720
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard on her, but she'll manage...</font>

261
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,190
<font color="yellow">if you're happy.</font>

262
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,750
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

263
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,920
<font color="yellow">Did she punch you...</font>

264
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,080
<font color="yellow">into realising what she's capable of?</font>

265
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,840
<font color="yellow">She's incredibly strong.</font>

266
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,850
<font color="yellow">I almost...</font>

267
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:14,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about what she did to you. I apologise.</font>

268
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,620
<font color="yellow">Make it up to me.</font>

269
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,520
<font color="yellow">One apology isn't enough.</font>

270
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,190
<font color="yellow">I'll make it up to you with the sales of my book.</font>

271
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,550
<font color="yellow">Go on, then.</font>

272
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,990
<font color="yellow">Let's have a farewell drink.</font>

273
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,420
<font color="yellow">This is just... It's not a proper goodbye.</font>

274
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,020
<font color="yellow">My wife's on the way.</font>

275
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,050
<font color="yellow">Let's keep our farewell...</font>

276
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,490
<font color="yellow">a little bit awkward.</font>

277
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,620
<font color="yellow">It's imperfect, just like our first meeting.</font>

278
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,520
<font color="yellow">That suits us.</font>

279
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,550
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

280
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,720
<font color="yellow">Anything more is too much. Right?</font>

281
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,450
<font color="yellow">This is just right.</font>

282
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,790
<font color="yellow">Be happy.</font>

283
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,090
<font color="yellow">Why would you get a divorce if nothing's wrong?</font>

284
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,910
<font color="yellow">Mum, if something's wrong, talk it out with him.</font>

285
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,240
<font color="yellow">What are you even doing here?</font>

286
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,990
<font color="yellow">This is no time to wipe the floor!</font>

287
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,810
<font color="yellow">Dad can't cook or clean.</font>

288
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,820
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won.</font>

289
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,300
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

290
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,900
<font color="yellow">Talk some sense into my mum. Please?</font>

291
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,320
<font color="yellow">You aren't in the right.</font>

292
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,730
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

293
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,010
<font color="yellow">Don't say what you can't take back.</font>

294
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,690
<font color="yellow">Soo Young, you're just about to go too far.</font>

295
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,280
<font color="yellow">She's just as responsible.</font>

296
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,590
<font color="yellow">She's the reason our dad is like this.</font>

297
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,270
<font color="yellow">Tell them what we told you...</font>

298
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,930
<font color="yellow">before we got married.</font>

299
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,720
<font color="yellow">We told you to keep Dad in line.</font>

300
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,120
<font color="yellow">But you cursed us out for being ungrateful brats.</font>

301
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,420
<font color="yellow">Why do this now when you're responsible?</font>

302
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,850
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

303
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,620
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

304
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,890
<font color="yellow">What should I tell my husband?</font>

305
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,490
<font color="yellow">What should I tell my in-laws?</font>

306
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,250
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with all the women...</font>

307
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,890
<font color="yellow">in my family?</font>

308
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,120
<font color="yellow">All three of you are divorced!</font>

309
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,560
<font color="yellow">It's such an embarrassment!</font>

310
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,580
<font color="yellow">Will you wash rags forever?</font>

311
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,320
<font color="yellow">Say something.</font>

312
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,190
<font color="yellow">Your girls might lose their voices.</font>

313
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,190
<font color="yellow">Mum!</font>

314
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,320
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

315
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,920
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you didn't say anything earlier.</font>

316
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,720
<font color="yellow">If you did,</font>

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,750
<font color="yellow">it would've only made things worse.</font>

318
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,210
<font color="yellow">This is when I feel lucky.</font>

319
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,490
<font color="yellow">I have no parents,</font>

320
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,780
<font color="yellow">no husband and no kids.</font>

321
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,020
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

322
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,850
<font color="yellow">I envy you and Choong Nam a lot.</font>

323
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,690
<font color="yellow">But I have cancer instead.</font>

324
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,220
<font color="yellow">That's why we feel sorry for you, too.</font>

325
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,390
<font color="yellow">I think Choong Nam has the best life.</font>

327
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,640
<font color="yellow">who leech off of her, remember?</font>

328
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,150
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see them?</font>

329
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,850
<font color="yellow">I forgot about that.</font>

330
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,850
<font color="yellow">Life is tough for everyone, isn't it?</font>

331
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,960
<font color="yellow">Are you done with chemo?</font>

332
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,750
<font color="yellow">For now.</font>

333
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,490
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

334
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,050

337
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,520
<font color="yellow">She's really scary.</font>

338
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,550
<font color="yellow">Don't tell her that I said that.</font>

339
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,250
<font color="yellow">You said that to her yourself.</font>

340
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,780
<font color="yellow">Why do I sometimes do that?</font>

341
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,250
<font color="yellow">You do it often, not just sometimes.</font>

342
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,590
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,600
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

470
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,300
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop her. I told her not to do it.</font>

471
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,770
<font color="yellow">I told her to keep serving you until the end...</font>

472
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,870
<font color="yellow">since that's what she's done all her life.</font>

473
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,660
<font color="yellow">Are you on my side then?</font>

474
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,740
<font color="yellow">But I change my mind.</font>

475
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,440
<font color="yellow">I was too cruel to her.</font>

476
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,790
<font color="yellow">If you're being like this to me, she must have had it worse.</font>

477
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,900
<font color="yellow">She should live the way she wants for whatever she has left.</font>

478
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,440
<font color="yellow">I'm glad this happened.</font>

479
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,900
<font color="yellow">Also, if you need someone to do your housework,</font>

480
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,720
<font color="yellow">call your siblings.</font>

481
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,260
<font color="yellow">Call the ones you gave away all your money to...</font>

482
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,170
<font color="yellow">and tell them to work for you.</font>

483
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,440
<font color="yellow">They're all men.</font>

484
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,500
<font color="yellow">I'm a woman! So what?</font>

485
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,840
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

486
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,940
<font color="yellow">If you're loud, I'll leave.</font>

487
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,470
<font color="yellow">I won't do the dishes.</font>

488
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,110
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you this.</font>

489
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,290
<font color="yellow">Going to the same elementary school...</font>

490
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,100
<font color="yellow">doesn't mean we have legal ties, okay?</font>

491
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,550
<font color="yellow">We are legal strangers.</font>

492
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,070
<font color="yellow">I'm going to get her. She called.</font>

493
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,670
<font color="yellow">She told me to come over.</font>

494
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,800
<font color="yellow">It's her final farewell, you idiot.</font>

495
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,100
<font color="yellow">Clean the room and the basin!</font>

496
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,270
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be doing any housework.</font>

497
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,470
<font color="yellow">I'm repaying the debt for when he beat up...</font>

498
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,200
<font color="yellow">the kids who bullied me in school.</font>

499
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,970
<font color="yellow">I hate myself for remembering all that.</font>

500
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,040
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won. Right.</font>

501
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,400
<font color="yellow">Help me get revenge.</font>

502
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,400
<font color="yellow">Who's the target?</font>

503
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
<font color="yellow">The professors who left me out.</font>

504
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,370
<font color="yellow">Let's do it. We're in a foul mood, so let's do something about it.</font>

505
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,300
<font color="yellow">Do you have a plan?</font>

506
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,400
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking of one.</font>

507
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,300
<font color="yellow">Where are you?</font>

508
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,350
<font color="yellow">I passed the green gate. Where do you live?</font>

509
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,540
<font color="yellow">Look up.</font>

510
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,200
<font color="yellow">I cared for my parents.</font>

511
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,140
<font color="yellow">What's wrong about that?</font>

512
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,840
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong about me giving money to my siblings?</font>

513
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,200
<font color="yellow">Tell me. Go on.</font>

514
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,770
<font color="yellow">Nothing's wrong.</font>

515
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,770
<font color="yellow">Just divorce me. Why move out?</font>

516
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,470
<font color="yellow">What? Are you too scared to get divorced?</font>

517
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,770
<font color="yellow">If this is what you want, let's get a divorce.</font>

518
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,340
<font color="yellow">I signed the divorce papers. Sign it and hand it in.</font>

519
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,270
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

520
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,140
<font color="yellow">Let's get divorced.</font>

521
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,320
<font color="yellow">But this house is mine.</font>

522
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,000
<font color="yellow">It's in your name, but it's mine.</font>

523
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,470
<font color="yellow">Do you want a lawsuit?</font>

524
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,500
<font color="yellow">Are you scared?</font>

525
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,100
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

526
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,700
<font color="yellow">Let's go to court.</font>

527
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,540
<font color="yellow">What did I do that's so wrong?</font>

528
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,980
<font color="yellow">My parents told me to look after my siblings...</font>

529
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,040
<font color="yellow">because it's my duty as the eldest.</font>

530
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,740
<font color="yellow">All I did was obey their last words.</font>

531
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,030
<font color="yellow">Is it terribly wrong for a son to do as he was told?</font>

532
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:17,660
<font color="yellow">When my parents scorned you for not having a son,</font>

533
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,400
<font color="yellow">I left home instead of siding with them!</font>

534
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,600
<font color="yellow">I abandoned them like an old shoe for your sake!</font>

535
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,360
<font color="yellow">You did not abandon them. You moved next door...</font>

536
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,680
<font color="yellow">and I had to go over at dawn to cook and clean for them.</font>

537
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,460
<font color="yellow">They pulled out my hair whenever they had the chance.</font>

538
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,180
<font color="yellow">Honey. You did not abandon them.</font>

539
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,570
<font color="yellow">Get your facts straight. You just moved out.</font>

540
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,190
<font color="yellow">Don't call me honey if you want a divorce.</font>

541
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,110
<font color="yellow">You're right. What should I call you then?</font>

542
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,640
<font color="yellow">Should I call you by your name like Hee Ja does?</font>

543
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,340
<font color="yellow">See you in court.</font>

544
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,000
<font color="yellow">It's a long walk down. Take care.</font>

545
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,350
<font color="yellow">What did I do that's so wrong?</font>

546
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,700
<font color="yellow">Not take you around the world?</font>

547
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:08,040
<font color="yellow">Is it so wrong that I want to save money?</font>

548
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,540
<font color="yellow">Don't make me repeat myself. You did nothing wrong.</font>

549
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,040
<font color="yellow">My whole life, parents were my first priority...</font>

550
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,740
<font color="yellow">and my siblings came second. Is that so wrong?</font>

551
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,240
<font color="yellow">If your siblings come after your parents,</font>

552
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,600
<font color="yellow">then go live with them.</font>

553
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,530
<font color="yellow">Before my mum died, she told me to live a comfortable life.</font>

554
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,270
<font color="yellow">That's why I moved out.</font>

555
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,580
<font color="yellow">I could barely handle my own life, so I sent her to a care home.</font>

556
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,800
<font color="yellow">And I ended up taking her to the beach where she died.</font>

557
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,640
<font color="yellow">But I will obey my mum's dying wish.</font>

558
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,570
<font color="yellow">I can be just a good a child, too!</font>

559
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,870
<font color="yellow">You weren't that great a wife!</font>

560
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,780
<font color="yellow">I will do it.</font>

561
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,440
<font color="yellow">Stay in your seat.</font>

562
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,200
<font color="yellow">You're good at this.</font>

563
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,900
<font color="yellow">My wife taught me well.</font>

564
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,170
<font color="yellow">She was very strict...</font>

565
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,850
<font color="yellow">for the last three years of her life.</font>

566
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,020
<font color="yellow">She did that so you could survive on your own without her.</font>

567
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:35,740
<font color="yellow">That's all done.</font>

568
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,880
<font color="yellow">Now, I need some vinegar.</font>

569
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,940
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

570
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,600
<font color="yellow">Who made this mess?</font>

571
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,900
<font color="yellow">Use salt instead.</font>

572
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,870
<font color="yellow">- Salt?
- Salt.</font>

573
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,300
<font color="yellow">Yes. That will work, too.</font>

574
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,940
<font color="yellow">(Secret Garden)</font>

575
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,370
<font color="yellow">Didn't I do well?</font>

576
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,940
<font color="yellow">It's lovely.</font>

577
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,700
<font color="yellow">Good for you.</font>

578
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,520
<font color="yellow">It's a great way to kill time.</font>

579
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,440
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's a problem for people our age.</font>

580
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,360
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh. You did so very well.</font>

581
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,740
<font color="yellow">I did more.</font>

582
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,340
<font color="yellow">You're having fun.</font>

583
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,510
<font color="yellow">How did you get in?</font>

584
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,940
<font color="yellow">I walked in. I'm too old to scale the wall.</font>

585
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,970
<font color="yellow">Where's Yeong Won?</font>

586
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,150
<font color="yellow">Parking the car.</font>

587
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,400
<font color="yellow">I'll bring some tea.</font>

588
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

589
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,440
<font color="yellow">I meant to visit you,</font>

590
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,030
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't because I crashed the car. Sorry.</font>

591
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,040
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Be nice to her instead.</font>

592
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,770
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you if you aren't.</font>

593
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,320
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Does your shoulder hurt?</font>

594
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. I guess I clung to the walking frame too hard.</font>

595
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,940
<font color="yellow">Let me massage your shoulders.</font>

596
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,140
<font color="yellow">I'll borrow him for a bit.</font>

597
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,870
<font color="yellow">Keep him.</font>

598
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
<font color="yellow">Can I keep you?</font>

599
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,680
<font color="yellow">How does it feel?</font>

600
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,370
<font color="yellow">It hurts. Don't be so rough.</font>

601
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,610
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Gi Ja?</font>

602
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,240
<font color="yellow">Why are you writing about me?</font>

603
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,010
<font color="yellow">It's for a novel.</font>

604
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,540
<font color="yellow">I'm busy, so listen to my story first.</font>

605
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,040
<font color="yellow">Let the eldest go first.</font>

606
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,540
<font color="yellow">- We're all busy people, come on.
- She's right.</font>

607
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,370
<font color="yellow">Will you all be quiet?</font>

608
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,840
<font color="yellow">Wan's too confused to write.</font>

609
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,200
<font color="yellow">Why would she be confused? She understands us just fine.</font>

610
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,140
<font color="yellow">What will you write? I have to know.</font>

611
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,370
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- What is it?</font>

612
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,870
<font color="yellow">Wan, I'm very busy.</font>

613
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,540
<font color="yellow">Let me go first.</font>

614
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,670
<font color="yellow">The more you interrupt, the longer she needs. Let her talk.</font>

615
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,540
<font color="yellow">Hey. I mean, ladies.</font>

616
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,070
<font color="yellow">I'm interviewing you to write a book.</font>

617
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:54,640
<font color="yellow">I won't be writing about your sad lives.</font>

618
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
<font color="yellow">It's just a novel.</font>

619
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,340
<font color="yellow">- The concept is...
- What's a concept?</font>

620
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,270
<font color="yellow">- What's that?
- It doesn't matter.</font>

621
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,540
<font color="yellow">Why would she mention it then?</font>

622
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,100
<font color="yellow">- Go on.
- Talk.</font>

623
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,140
<font color="yellow">We're listening.</font>

624
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,740
<font color="yellow">My book will target the younger generations.</font>

625
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,150
<font color="yellow">Will it not be about us, then?</font>

626
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,770
<font color="yellow">Young people aren't interested in old people...</font>

627
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,440
<font color="yellow">whining about...</font>

628
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,540
<font color="yellow">how tough their lives were or how sad they felt.</font>

629
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,300
<font color="yellow">We get it. They don't care.</font>

630
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,270
<font color="yellow">You want us to answer your questions and not add anything else...</font>

631
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,240
<font color="yellow">because there's no time for that, right?</font>

632
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
<font color="yellow">Bingo.</font>

633
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,040
<font color="yellow">But don't you want to know about your mum's love life?</font>

634
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,970
<font color="yellow">She's wouldn't know. She's not a mum.</font>

635
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,770
<font color="yellow">What? I'm a virgin.</font>

636
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,740
<font color="yellow">Let the childless be silent.</font>

637
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,640
<font color="yellow">So you are saying that you came up with...</font>

638
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,430
<font color="yellow">a theme or keyword for each of us.</font>

639
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,930
<font color="yellow">I'm the actress who is the symbol of love.</font>

640
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,320
<font color="yellow">I'm the friendly mum. I like that.</font>

641
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,390
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to mention our fights.</font>

642
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,300
<font color="yellow">Don't be hesitant to write in detail.</font>

643
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,600
<font color="yellow">- You even threw a vase.
- A vase?</font>

644
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,940
<font color="yellow">In front of her mum?</font>

645
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,670
<font color="yellow">I'll mention that you pulled my hair out.</font>

646
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,870
<font color="yellow">Can you add some romance for my character?</font>

647
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:15,070
<font color="yellow">Or how about we just go all out and mention intercourse?</font>

648
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,400
<font color="yellow">Do you want to discuss that with your daughter?</font>

649
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,650
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

650
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,950
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be the nice and generous mum.</font>

651
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,860
<font color="yellow">That means I have to be generous until I die.</font>

652
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,300
<font color="yellow">Wan, I don't want to represent the mum who sacrifices.</font>

653
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,520
<font color="yellow">Write something else.</font>

654
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,600
<font color="yellow">Don't mention my daughters' divorce or abuse, either.</font>

655
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,300
<font color="yellow">Focus on me.</font>

656
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

657
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,340
<font color="yellow">What's there to write about you if not about your daughters?</font>

658
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,560
<font color="yellow">You just have to write what I tell you.</font>

659
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,740
<font color="yellow">Don't make anything up. Write whatever I say.</font>

660
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,180
<font color="yellow">If I don't like even one syllable, scratch it out.</font>

661
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,870
<font color="yellow">- Start with my crazy aunt...
- Come on, not again.</font>

662
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:54,050
<font color="yellow">- She's at it again.
- Not again.</font>

663
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:58,310
<font color="yellow">Because of her, my mum lost her mind and then died.</font>

664
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,170
<font color="yellow">Then there's my brother whom I don't even remember.</font>

665
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,270
<font color="yellow">During the Korean War, my mother fled while dragging my father...</font>

666
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,070
<font color="yellow">who was shot in the heart. It's such a heartbreaking...</font>

667
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,300
<font color="yellow">It sounds like...</font>

668
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,300
<font color="yellow">it was during the Third Battle of Seoul.</font>

669
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,040
<font color="yellow">That was during spring.</font>

670
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,440
<font color="yellow">Cherry blossoms were in full bloom along the streets...</font>

671
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,240
<font color="yellow">How is the Third Battle of Seoul in spring? It was winter.</font>

672
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
<font color="yellow">- That's true.
- Don't lie.</font>

673
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,330
<font color="yellow">I'm not lying!</font>

674
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,560
<font color="yellow">That's what my mum said. She saw cherry blossoms.</font>

675
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,870
<font color="yellow">- No way.
- It wasn't that battle then.</font>

676
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,010
<font color="yellow">- Wan, where are you going?
- Hey!</font>

677
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,010
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

678
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

679
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,830
<font color="yellow">- It's because of you.
- It's your fault.</font>

680
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you all blaming me?</font>

681
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,600
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Go follow her.</font>

682
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,180
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

683
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,200
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

684
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,010
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Can't you talk more softly?</font>

685
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,470
<font color="yellow">Why are you all so loud?</font>

686
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing making us wait? Come back out.</font>

687
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,370
<font color="yellow">Wait outside.</font>

688
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,840
<font color="yellow">Give me five seconds.</font>

689
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,570
<font color="yellow">I feel nauseous.</font>

690
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,900
<font color="yellow">What a temper. Gosh.</font>

691
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
<font color="yellow">Wan is upset.</font>

692
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,840
<font color="yellow">If you want the book to be made, you have to listen to her.</font>

693
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,090
<font color="yellow">Wan has a bit of a bad personality.</font>

694
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,160
<font color="yellow">"A bit"? She's pretty mean.</font>

695
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,660
<font color="yellow">She takes it after me.</font>

696
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,180
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Take her side.</font>

697
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,640
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You won't write?</font>

698
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,760
<font color="yellow">You won't write it?</font>

699
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,770
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

700
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,360
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense. Why did you bring us here?</font>

701
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,520
<font color="yellow">She's right.</font>

702
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's wrong?</font>

703
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,460
<font color="yellow">If it doesn't make sense that I'm not writing,</font>

704
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,460
<font color="yellow">does anything you say make sense?</font>

705
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,800
<font color="yellow">You want me to record your 24 hours?</font>

706
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,560
<font color="yellow">What good will that do?</font>

707
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,540
<font color="yellow">Do you want your kids to know how bored you are?</font>

708
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,990
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to package you to sound more beautiful.</font>

709
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,130
<font color="yellow">It would be good. The book would sell.</font>

710
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,640
<font color="yellow">It would be good for your kids to read it, too.</font>

711
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,490
<font color="yellow">For 365 days a year,</font>

712
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,740
<font color="yellow">the mother thinks of her kids.</font>

713
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,660
<font color="yellow">However, she doesn't call them...</font>

714
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,030
<font color="yellow">in order to be considerate.</font>

715
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,270
<font color="yellow">Even so, she's still happy.</font>

716
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,270
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

717
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,800
<font color="yellow">That's a lie.</font>

718
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,170
<font color="yellow">I'm disgusted by my kids.</font>

719
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,990
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to write about me being lonely...</font>

720
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,670
<font color="yellow">for 24 hours a day,</font>

721
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,300
<font color="yellow">take me out of it.</font>

722
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,200
<font color="yellow">- Hee Ja.
- What I do all day...</font>

723
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,900
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

724
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,330
<font color="yellow">- I...
- She was so bored...</font>

725
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:33,160
<font color="yellow">that she made 100 rosaries...</font>

726
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,930
<font color="yellow">in 3 or 4 days.</font>

727
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,350
<font color="yellow">Make sure her kids find out.</font>

728
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,790
<font color="yellow">If you don't, I'll kill you.</font>

729
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:43,440
<font color="yellow">I'm small, but I raised four men including my husband.</font>

730
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,960
<font color="yellow">They wore me out when they needed me.</font>

731
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,160
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm old, they trapped me in here.</font>

732
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
<font color="yellow">They didn't trap you in here.</font>

733
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,530
<font color="yellow">You told them you didn't want to live with them.</font>

734
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:57,530
<font color="yellow">Wan isn't trying to write about a mum taking revenge on her kids.</font>

735
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,530
<font color="yellow">She's trying to write a beautiful story...</font>

736
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:02,510
<font color="yellow">about sacrificing mothers and their lives.</font>

737
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,970
<font color="yellow">Life is not beautiful!</font>

738
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,790
<font color="yellow">Life is a war between kids and parents!</font>

739
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,360
<font color="yellow">It's a war between the young and old.</font>

740
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,370
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

741
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,030
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's war.</font>

742
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,490
<font color="yellow">Is this "Love and War"?</font>

743
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,330
<font color="yellow">So in my opinion,</font>

744
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,730
<font color="yellow">old people like us should just live together.</font>

745
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,760
<font color="yellow">We made that promise 50 years ago.</font>

746
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,460
<font color="yellow">We said we would live together some day.</font>

747
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,630
<font color="yellow">50 years ago?</font>

748
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,540
<font color="yellow">Everything is 40 to 50 years ago.</font>

749
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,460
<font color="yellow">- I'd like that.
- All of us?</font>

750
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,330
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to.
- When?</font>

751
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,340
<font color="yellow">When should we start?</font>

752
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,900
<font color="yellow">If you start on a topic,</font>

753
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,190
<font color="yellow">I want you to finish it before going to another one.</font>

754
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:43,220
<font color="yellow">Going back, I lost my dad during the Third Battle of Seoul.</font>

755
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,590
<font color="yellow">My mum brought 10 of us...</font>

756
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,640
<font color="yellow">It's three.</font>

757
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,940
<font color="yellow">Including our cousins, there were 10 of us.</font>

758
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,030
<font color="yellow">Whenever I hear that story,</font>

759
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,470
<font color="yellow">it breaks my heart.</font>

760
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:57,680
<font color="yellow">"Mum, I'm so sorry!"</font>

761
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,570
<font color="yellow">I came here to tell you this.</font>

762
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,700
<font color="yellow">My poor mother!</font>

763
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,040
<font color="yellow">- I came here although I'm busy.
- Listen carefully.</font>

764
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,770
<font color="yellow">That's because I wanted...</font>

765
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,360
<font color="yellow">to tell my mother's story, not mine.</font>

766
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,300
<font color="yellow">I came here with a fluttering heart.</font>

767
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,310
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Did I tell you about my horrible mother-in-law?</font>

768
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,100
<font color="yellow">Mum, did I tell you?</font>

769
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,670
<font color="yellow">I died because of you.</font>

770
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
<font color="yellow">I was playing a game.</font>

771
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,940
<font color="yellow">All right. If I might add,</font>

772
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,750
<font color="yellow">the kids I worked so hard to raise...</font>

773
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,940
<font color="yellow">are sending me their kids to look after them.</font>

774
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,540
<font color="yellow">My life is so sad.</font>

775
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,950
<font color="yellow">I want my kids to feel bad when they read it.</font>

776
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,700
<font color="yellow">Make the book break their hearts.</font>

777
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:44,940
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

778
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,210
<font color="yellow">my mother-in-law would snatch my bowl when I ate...</font>

779
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,940
<font color="yellow">to throw to the stray dogs.</font>

780
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,300
<font color="yellow">Make sure you include this.</font>

781
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:56,740
<font color="yellow">That's a soap opera. It's ridiculous.</font>

782
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,230
<font color="yellow">All your stories are for a soap opera!</font>

783
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,370
<font color="yellow">- Life is a soap opera.
- Life is a soap opera.</font>

784
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,370
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

785
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:07,710
<font color="yellow">"When I turned around after letting go of my mother,"</font>

786
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,970
<font color="yellow">"the owl cried and so did I."</font>

787
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,540
<font color="yellow">"At the mountain's peak, dead leaves rolled..."</font>

788
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,640
<font color="yellow">"in a gust."</font>

789
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,760
<font color="yellow">I want the elderly characters in my book to be beautiful.</font>

790
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,070
<font color="yellow">The kids will read it and be happy.</font>

791
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,670
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't that be better?</font>

792
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,390
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to talk about all these stories?</font>

793
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:27,240
<font color="yellow">It's all about your misfortunes.</font>

794
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,060
<font color="yellow">It's a cruel fairy tale.</font>

795
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,840
<font color="yellow">It's sad and miserable.</font>

796
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,140
<font color="yellow">It hurts to hear just a minute of it.</font>

797
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,540
<font color="yellow">You can't bear it. It's not fun to read at all!</font>

798
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,240
<font color="yellow">Because that's the truth.</font>

799
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,140
<font color="yellow">That is the reality of our lives.</font>

800
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,500
<font color="yellow">That's reality.</font>

801
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,570
<font color="yellow">This is why you haven't been able to write until now.</font>

802
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,530
<font color="yellow">Soap operas are the best.</font>

803
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,970
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't it make sense for me to run away from home...</font>

804
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:58,500
<font color="yellow">because I wanted to drink beer?</font>

805
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,700
<font color="yellow">I think it'll make a good story.</font>

806
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,170
<font color="yellow">I want the novel to be beautiful...</font>

807
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:10,780
<font color="yellow">Revenges are lousy.</font>

808
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,900
<font color="yellow">What revenge?</font>

809
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,870
<font color="yellow">I only came out to live freely.</font>

810
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,990
<font color="yellow">I don't intend on taking revenge.</font>

811
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:19,070
<font color="yellow">Really, Wan.</font>

812
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,460
<font color="yellow">Mum, why don't you tell her about your husband?</font>

813
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,360
<font color="yellow">You should make it into a revenge story.</font>

814
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,670
<font color="yellow">I should.</font>

815
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,240
<font color="yellow">I don't care if it's lousy. It's about revenge for me.</font>

816
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,260
<font color="yellow">Fine! I'm lousy.</font>

817
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,730
<font color="yellow">Are you better than me?</font>

818
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,130
<font color="yellow">- Are you?
- Gi Ja, come here.</font>

819
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,390
<font color="yellow">- Come with me.
- I am Gi Ja the Lousy!</font>

820
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,790
<font color="yellow">That's my life!</font>

821
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:45,000
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- So what? What?</font>

822
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,700
<font color="yellow">Grandma. Mum.</font>

823
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:48,130
<font color="yellow">Everyone.</font>

824
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:49,830
<font color="yellow">Something popped up...</font>

825
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,380
<font color="yellow">and I need to write it down before I forget it.</font>

826
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,140
<font color="yellow">You did great today.</font>

827
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,700
<font color="yellow">- Good, good, good.
- Hey. We just started.</font>

828
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,660
<font color="yellow">- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?</font>

829
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,140
<font color="yellow">- Good job, all.
- We just started. Are you leaving?</font>

830
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,620
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

831
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,590
<font color="yellow">She left because of you.</font>

832
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,120
<font color="yellow">Me? Really?</font>

833
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,870
<font color="yellow">You should reflect on it.</font>

834
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:10,740
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

835
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hye Min. Where are you?</font>

836
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
<font color="yellow">You're at the office?</font>

837
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,510
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll come over right now.</font>

838
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,930
<font color="yellow">Life is a war between kids and parents!</font>

839
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,170
<font color="yellow">It's a war between the young and old.</font>

840
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,510
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

841
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,860
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

842
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,570
<font color="yellow">My mother-in-law would snatch my bowl...</font>

843
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,030
<font color="yellow">Isn't it pretty good?</font>

844
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,590
<font color="yellow">Instead of the sad and beautiful...</font>

845
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,340
<font color="yellow">story about the elderly you were planning...</font>

846
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,970
<font color="yellow">It is a horribly, cruel fairy tale...</font>

847
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:53,060
<font color="yellow">from the elderly to the young.</font>

848
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,160
<font color="yellow">We'll start with how Gi Ja's mother-in-law liked pig heads...</font>

849
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,430
<font color="yellow">and also how she threw Gi Ja's food to the dogs.</font>

850
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:03,060
<font color="yellow">Then there's Jeong A who made all that food then ran away.</font>

851
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,670
<font color="yellow">The bullying professors.</font>

852
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,160
<font color="yellow">Then comes Grandma Sook Hyun and her cruel revenge.</font>

853
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,170
<font color="yellow">She's Choong Nam's mother.</font>

854
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,990
<font color="yellow">Is it really in the ten thousands?</font>

855
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,000
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

856
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:17,390
<font color="yellow">My grandma is pretty bad, too.</font>

857
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:20,650
<font color="yellow">Is she really keeping this up just to take revenge on her husband?</font>

858
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,820
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

859
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,740
<font color="yellow">Don't we need at least a page of romance?</font>

860
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,490
<font color="yellow">We have it. We have just that.</font>

861
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,940
<font color="yellow">The lawyer Seong Jae and the odd Hee Ja.</font>

862
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,300
<font color="yellow">No. Yeong Won is better suited for romance.</font>

863
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,460
<font color="yellow">Oh, you mean the actress?</font>

864
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,470
<font color="yellow">She's the actress, right?</font>

865
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,830
<font color="yellow">- This is amazing.
- It's so good.</font>

866
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,220
<font color="yellow">I told you it's amazing.</font>

867
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,670
<font color="yellow">It's so cool.</font>

868
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:50,870
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

869
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,910
<font color="yellow">Come on, dance with him once.</font>

870
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:56,090
<font color="yellow">He's been doing this for three days.</font>

871
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,940
<font color="yellow">Be generous, please?</font>

872
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,540
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- I don't want to.</font>

873
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,030
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're going to be blessed.</font>

874
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,100
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

875
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:10,270
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

876
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,140
<font color="yellow">Rice?</font>

877
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:13,740
<font color="yellow">It's in the cooker.</font>

878
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,210
<font color="yellow">Money?</font>

879
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,270
<font color="yellow">I don't have any!</font>

880
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,360
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, what do you think...</font>

881
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,070
<font color="yellow">I decided to write the stories of the elders...</font>

882
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:30,700
<font color="yellow">as they are without sugar-coating them.</font>

883
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,370
<font color="yellow">If this tiring...</font>

884
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,400
<font color="yellow">and lousy life...</font>

885
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,970
<font color="yellow">is really what life is like,</font>

886
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,300
<font color="yellow">then there's nothing I can do.</font>

887
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,240
<font color="yellow">I decided to only write what's true.</font>

888
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,270
<font color="yellow">They're the protagonists of their lives.</font>

889
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,670
<font color="yellow">So they have the right to choose.</font>

890
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,240
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

891
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,640
<font color="yellow">It's so hot.</font>

892
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,740
<font color="yellow">Wan. Are you asleep?</font>

893
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

894
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,980
<font color="yellow">I made up my mind.</font>

895
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,140
<font color="yellow">Can't you still change it?</font>

896
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,080
<font color="yellow">I make rosaries every evening and I'm afraid that will...</font>

897
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,440
<font color="yellow">upset the kids and make them worry.</font>

898
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,670
<font color="yellow">Can't you say I'm doing it...</font>

899
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,740
<font color="yellow">for the community and not out of loneliness?</font>

900
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,670
<font color="yellow">I'm a mother...</font>

901
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:04,830
<font color="yellow">so I shouldn't do anything to cause them concern.</font>

902
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:05,840
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

903
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,480
<font color="yellow">Your life is already all about caring for others.</font>

904
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,170
<font color="yellow">You did enough. They have to know...</font>

905
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,500
<font color="yellow">about your long, lonely nights.</font>

906
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,700
<font color="yellow">Hang up and go to bed.</font>

907
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,140
<font color="yellow">Be strong.</font>

908
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,600
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

909
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,280
<font color="yellow">What I said earlier today?</font>

910
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,370
<font color="yellow">I didn't move out to get revenge.</font>

911
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,940
<font color="yellow">You said that's what it looks like.</font>

912
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,200
<font color="yellow">I'm having some dark beer and now I feel...</font>

913
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,770
<font color="yellow">all sad and bitter.</font>

914
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:50,400
<font color="yellow">I want to leave my girls out because it'll cause pain...</font>

915
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,840
<font color="yellow">for them, not for me.</font>

916
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,100
<font color="yellow">Why else would I move out...</font>

917
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
<font color="yellow">if it's not for revenge?</font>

918
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,100
<font color="yellow">It really isn't about getting revenge at all.</font>

919
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,000
<font color="yellow">It's just...</font>

920
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:09,470
<font color="yellow">I just want to be able to have a beer whenever I want to.</font>

921
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

922
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,190
<font color="yellow">You didn't move out to get revenge.</font>

923
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,000

924

964
