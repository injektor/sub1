1
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,050
<font color="yellow">Mum, where are you?</font>

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,150
<font color="yellow">The hospital?</font>

3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,510
<font color="yellow">You'll get checked up too while you're there, right?</font>

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,060
<font color="yellow">How can I not when your grandma's here?</font>

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,320
<font color="yellow">I registered, too.</font>

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,620
<font color="yellow">Oh Ssang Boon and Jang Nan Hee.</font>

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,820
<font color="yellow">We have to go in now. Bye.</font>

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,350
<font color="yellow">It'll be fine, Mum.</font>

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,480
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

11
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,350
<font color="yellow">Please come this way.</font>

12
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,150
<font color="yellow">Who is Jang Nan Hee?</font>

13
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,150
<font color="yellow">Me.</font>

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,750
<font color="yellow">How are you for time, today?</font>

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,540
<font color="yellow">What did he say?</font>

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,650
<font color="yellow">We have time. What is it?</font>

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,990
<font color="yellow">You should get CT scans while you're here.</font>

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,910
<font color="yellow">Nurse Kim.</font>

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,850
<font color="yellow">Can you prepare CT scans for Ms Oh and Ms Jang?</font>

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,530
<font color="yellow">These big headed doctors won't let you ask questions.</font>

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,420
<font color="yellow">They just say what they want and then leave.</font>

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,410
<font color="yellow">If they try to leave, you can hold them back and ask.</font>

23
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,280
<font color="yellow">You act like you know everything.</font>

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,250
<font color="yellow">Why did you act so stupid?</font>

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,350
<font color="yellow">You must feel lucky to have a stupid mum.</font>

26
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,780
<font color="yellow">Ask them everything.</font>

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,380
<font color="yellow">Ask them how Grandma is,</font>

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,420
<font color="yellow">why you have to take a CT scan...</font>

29
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,750
<font color="yellow">and what they saw in the x-ray.</font>

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,250
<font color="yellow">Ask them how Grandma's diet should be if her stomach is bad.</font>

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,880
<font color="yellow">All right, All right.</font>

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,620
<font color="yellow">Ask them in detail.</font>

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,650
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,610
<font color="yellow">Record it on your phone.</font>

35
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,650
<font color="yellow">Record what the doctor says.</font>

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
<font color="yellow">Record it?</font>

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,620
<font color="yellow">How do I do that?</font>

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,180
<font color="yellow">How can you not know how when you know how to take pictures?</font>

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,850
<font color="yellow">I've never done it before.</font>

40
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,420
<font color="yellow">I'm not a spy. Why would I ever record anyone?</font>

41
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,250
<font color="yellow">I'm just worried about you and Grandma...</font>

42
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,820
<font color="yellow">If you're so worried, why didn't you come with us?</font>

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,250
<font color="yellow">When did she ever worry about me?</font>

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,450
<font color="yellow">How do I record it anyway?</font>

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,550
<font color="yellow">Ms Jang, it's time for your scan.</font>

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,180
<font color="yellow">Did my mum finish?</font>

47
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,420
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's done.</font>

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,420
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you go to the hospital?</font>

49
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,750
<font color="yellow">My mum's smart.</font>

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
<font color="yellow">She'll be fine.</font>

51
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,680
<font color="yellow">Grandma is turning 90 soon.</font>

52
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,950
<font color="yellow">My mum's really healthy.</font>

53
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,820
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see her beat up Dong Jin?</font>

54
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,840
<font color="yellow">Don't spray on me.</font>

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,920
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you. Swallow it.</font>

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,950
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh so hard.</font>

57
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

58
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,350
<font color="yellow">Did you read my manuscript yet?</font>

59
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,440
<font color="yellow">A hole?</font>

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's a hole.</font>

61
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,010
<font color="yellow">You have to take your pills.</font>

62
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,820
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, they have to open you up to fix the hole.</font>

63
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,150
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

64
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,920
<font color="yellow">Why would you open me up?</font>

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,180
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,780
<font color="yellow">If I had money for that, I'd die while eating it!</font>

67
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,450
<font color="yellow">- What a joke!
-  Goodness.</font>

68
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,350
<font color="yellow">One moment.</font>

69
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,820
<font color="yellow">Are you mad?</font>

70
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,380
<font color="yellow">I won't get a surgery.</font>

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die.</font>

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,580
<font color="yellow">Okay, we won't.</font>

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,480
<font color="yellow">Just take the pills the doctor gives you.</font>

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,580
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere...</font>

75
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,320
<font color="yellow">and play your game here.</font>

76
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,280
<font color="yellow">Stay here.</font>

77
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,650
<font color="yellow">The goblins will kidnap you if you leave.</font>

78
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,120
<font color="yellow">A bigger hospital?</font>

79
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,550
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

80
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,820
<font color="yellow">I'm completely fine.</font>

81
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,580
<font color="yellow">You need to get an MRI,</font>

82
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,750
<font color="yellow">but we don't have the equipment, so...</font>

83
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,750
<font color="yellow">What is there on my photo?</font>

84
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,550
<font color="yellow">There's a malignant tumour on your liver.</font>

85
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,780
<font color="yellow">On mine and not my mother's?</font>

86
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,150
<font color="yellow">A tumour? Malignant?</font>

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
<font color="yellow">Do I have cancer?</font>

88
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not 100 percent sure,</font>

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,550
<font color="yellow">- but in my opinion...
-  Why tell me if you aren't sure?</font>

90
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,780
<font color="yellow">I don't want to know your opinion.</font>

91
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,420
<font color="yellow">What do you see on the photo? What is there...</font>

92
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,720
<font color="yellow">that would make you say that to someone who's never been sick?</font>

93
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
<font color="yellow">That's why you need an MRI.</font>

94
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,380
<font color="yellow">We can't tell for sure with a CT.</font>

95
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,680
<font color="yellow">Why take a photo if you can't be sure?</font>

96
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,580
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,020
<font color="yellow">Explain slowly. What's on my liver?</font>

98
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,120
<font color="yellow">Where are the tumours?</font>

99
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,850
<font color="yellow">"A husband must protect..."</font>

100
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,460
<font color="yellow">"himself and his family,"</font>

101
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,020
<font color="yellow">"and not be a tyrant."</font>

102
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,950
<font color="yellow">"Eight."</font>

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,150
<font color="yellow">"A husband must not interfere in..."</font>

104
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,850
<font color="yellow">"or nag about the housework."</font>

105
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,740
<font color="yellow">"Nine."</font>

106
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,420
<font color="yellow">"A husband must not purchase furniture or clothes on his own,"</font>

107
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,480
<font color="yellow">"or make important decisions without discussing with his wife."</font>

108
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,280
<font color="yellow">Why are there so many don'ts?</font>

109
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,620
<font color="yellow">"Ten. A husband must always speak in a low voice,"</font>

110
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,120
<font color="yellow">"and be soft, kind and gentle."</font>

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,950
<font color="yellow">What a joke.</font>

112
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,920
<font color="yellow">What's the fun in life if we can't shout to our wives?</font>

113
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,450
<font color="yellow">Soft and kind?</font>

114
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,820
<font color="yellow">I have to act like a player then.</font>

115
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,880
<font color="yellow">What do I do next?</font>

116
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,320
<font color="yellow">I put food in the rice cooker.</font>

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
<font color="yellow">What do I do next?</font>

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,280
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,150
<font color="yellow">Is he crazy?</font>

120
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,550
<font color="yellow">Why would you put food in there? You put in rice.</font>

121
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,620
<font color="yellow">You have lost your mind.</font>

122
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,820
<font color="yellow">I know, I put rice in it.</font>

123
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,850
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

124
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,310
<font color="yellow">there are so many buttons on it.</font>

125
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,020
<font color="yellow">Press the one on the top right that says "plain rice".</font>

126
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,550
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

127
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,620
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

128
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,250
<font color="yellow">I pressed the one that says "plain rice".</font>

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,820
<font color="yellow">Will it cook?</font>

130
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,910
<font color="yellow">How do I know if it's done?</font>

131
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,220
<font color="yellow">You'll know when it's done. The cooker makes a noise.</font>

132
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,320
<font color="yellow">It'll tell you.</font>

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,950
<font color="yellow">He's actually cooking so he won't starve.</font>

134
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,330
<font color="yellow">I guess he won't starve then.</font>

135
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,360
<font color="yellow">He must really like you a lot.</font>

136
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,040
<font color="yellow">He keeps calling you.</font>

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,280
<font color="yellow">He just needs me.</font>

138
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,250
<font color="yellow">They took their clothes off. They're both naked.</font>

139
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,390
<font color="yellow">They're bare naked.</font>

140
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,680
<font color="yellow">I can't watch this alone.</font>

141
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,920
<font color="yellow">Look at that.</font>

142
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,750
<font color="yellow">They're naked from head to toe.</font>

143
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,850
<font color="yellow">Everything on them is so big.</font>

144
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,120
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, you need to watch this.</font>

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
<font color="yellow">Don't, it's gross.</font>

146
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,290
<font color="yellow">They're now...</font>

147
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,380
<font color="yellow">stuck to each other.</font>

148
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,150
<font color="yellow">Watch the movie with me. Why are you so strong?</font>

149
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,120
<font color="yellow">I really don't want to watch now.</font>

150
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,380
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

151
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,050
<font color="yellow">- Leave me alone.
-  Your face is so red.</font>

152
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,790
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to watch this movie then?</font>

153
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,650
<font color="yellow">Oh dear...</font>

154
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,480
<font color="yellow">How do I make doenjang jjigae?</font>

155
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,050
<font color="yellow">Is this all I need?</font>

156
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,480
<font color="yellow">Should they be squares?</font>

157
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,150
<font color="yellow">That's finally done.</font>

158
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,920
<font color="yellow">So based on this,</font>

159
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,050
<font color="yellow">she started going out at night...</font>

160
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,550
<font color="yellow">two months ago.</font>

161
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,650
<font color="yellow">The average time of her outings...</font>

162
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,480
<font color="yellow">is 90 minutes.</font>

163
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,180
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja lives two stops away from church,</font>

164
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,920
<font color="yellow">so that's about 1.5km.</font>

165
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,980
<font color="yellow">She makes the round trip in 90 minutes...</font>

166
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,950
<font color="yellow">and prays at church for about 15 minutes.</font>

167
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,780
<font color="yellow">That means she doesn't go anywhere else.</font>

168
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,980
<font color="yellow">I guess Jeong A isn't with her.</font>

169
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,850
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

170
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,450
<font color="yellow">Doctor Lee, hello.</font>

171
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,750
<font color="yellow">It's me, Seong Jae.</font>

172
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,750
<font color="yellow">I want to ask you something.</font>

173
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,820
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

174
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,620
<font color="yellow">It's about a friend of mine.</font>

175
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,980
<font color="yellow">I think she could have dementia.</font>

176
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,380
<font color="yellow">You lunatic. Are you living together already?</font>

177
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,850
<font color="yellow">Why are you eating with her at home?</font>

178
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,860
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

179
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,150
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

180
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,180
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

181
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,470
<font color="yellow">How's Dad?</font>

182
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,750
<font color="yellow">Mum told him to write something 100 times a day.</font>

183
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,920
<font color="yellow">I have to go.</font>

184
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,320
<font color="yellow">They're wasting so much money to keep these lights on.</font>

185
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,650
<font color="yellow">They're all crazy.</font>

186
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,250
<font color="yellow">They're spending their money, not yours.</font>

187
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,780
<font color="yellow">My money is their money.</font>

188
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,250
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get out to turn the lights off?</font>

189
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,350
<font color="yellow">I will if you'll let me. I can, you know?</font>

190
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,380
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

191
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,620
<font color="yellow">I took some important tests with you.</font>

192
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,250
<font color="yellow">Why won't you ask if I'm sick...</font>

193
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,880
<font color="yellow">or why I had to take the tests with you?</font>

194
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

195
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,520
<font color="yellow">She blamed her own hardships to ignore others' grievances.</font>

196
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,220
<font color="yellow">Now she uses her deafness.</font>

197
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

198
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,280
<font color="yellow">There's a malignant tumour in your liver.</font>

199
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
<font color="yellow">Give me your hand.</font>

200
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, come on.</font>

201
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,920
<font color="yellow">Not watching TV for one evening won't kill you.</font>

202
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,050
<font color="yellow">Put it over your hands.</font>

203
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,520
<font color="yellow">Put some on your face, not just on your hands.</font>

204
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,380
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

205
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,550
<font color="yellow">Let's see your feet.</font>

206
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,820
<font color="yellow">Right, the vitamins.</font>

207
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

208
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,830
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should have bought...</font>

209
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,380
<font color="yellow">some good supplements for myself too...</font>

210
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,180
<font color="yellow">instead of saving money.</font>

211
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,650
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

212
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

213
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,340
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep on yelling at me?</font>

214
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,920
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

215
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,150
<font color="yellow">Did you take your pills after dinner?</font>

216
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,180
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

217
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,050
<font color="yellow">You have better memory than me.</font>

218
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,920
<font color="yellow">Dad's going to have a hard time getting to sleep without you.</font>

219
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,660
<font color="yellow">He deserves it.</font>

220
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,820
<font color="yellow">You're always getting your revenge, aren't you?</font>

221
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,850
<font color="yellow">Are you mad because I made you use money?</font>

222
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,420
<font color="yellow">I should die,</font>

223
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,950
<font color="yellow">but I made you use money at the hospital.</font>

224
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

225
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,720
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm mad.</font>

226
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,050
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

227
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,770
<font color="yellow">Are you playing?</font>

228
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,770
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I'm working.</font>

229
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,150
<font color="yellow">I'm interviewing...</font>

230
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,040
<font color="yellow">Soo Young, Ho Young,</font>

231
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,450
<font color="yellow">Min Ho and Ha Neul.</font>

232
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,920
<font color="yellow">It feels like a watermelon is coming out of your nose.</font>

233
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,720
<font color="yellow">They all came over.</font>

234
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,520
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you, that's how it'll feel.</font>

235
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,420
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey, hey.</font>

236
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,440
<font color="yellow">Take these over yourselves.</font>

237
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,880
<font color="yellow">If you run out of food, get it from the fridge.</font>

238
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,750
<font color="yellow">How can you make me do all the work?</font>

239
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,780
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

240
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,880
<font color="yellow">I'm working.</font>

241
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,480
<font color="yellow">Hey, not the jerky. Those are mine.</font>

242
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,250
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
-  Yes.</font>

243
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,950
<font color="yellow">Talk on the phone or go chat. Just do one at a time.</font>

244
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,320
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey, hey!</font>

245
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,280
<font color="yellow">Don't drink so much.</font>

246
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,620
<font color="yellow">How can I interview you if you get drunk?</font>

247
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,650
<font color="yellow">You're not here to party.</font>

248
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,780
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

249
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,380
<font color="yellow">"What is it?"</font>

250
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,120
<font color="yellow">I went to the hospital, remember?</font>

251
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,650
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

252
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
<font color="yellow">What did they say?</font>

253
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,420
<font color="yellow">Grandma's stomach ulcer is bad.</font>

254
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,120
<font color="yellow">She'll have to take pills for a few months.</font>

255
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,000
<font color="yellow">It's because of the chilli.</font>

256
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,380
<font color="yellow">She always eats that spicy stuff every meal.</font>

257
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,250
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

258
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,350
<font color="yellow">I'm...</font>

259
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,520
<font color="yellow">fine, of course.</font>

260
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,420
<font color="yellow">You wasted money.</font>

261
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,620
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

262
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,720
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. You should be glad.</font>

263
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,380
<font color="yellow">I was worried.</font>

264
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,420
<font color="yellow">I feel good now.</font>

265
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,180
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, right?</font>

266
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,110
<font color="yellow">Did you listen to them properly?</font>

267
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,970
<font color="yellow">Can you finish up early...</font>

268
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,960
<font color="yellow">and come over? Grandma's here.</font>

269
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,810
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mum. I asked them over for my work.</font>

270
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,800
<font color="yellow">How can I go there now? That would be wrong.</font>

271
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,490
<font color="yellow">What's so wrong with it?</font>

272
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,910
<font color="yellow">Why are you being whiny again?</font>

273
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,050
<font color="yellow">You need to date someone instead.</font>

274
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,220
<font color="yellow">I'll get married soon,</font>

275
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
<font color="yellow">so you should find yourself a boyfriend...</font>

276
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
<font color="yellow">instead of being so attached to me.</font>

277
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,290
<font color="yellow">Whom are you marrying?</font>

278
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,680
<font color="yellow">A man.</font>

279
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,150
<font color="yellow">I love you, Nan Hee.</font>

280
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,950
<font color="yellow">Go to bed, Nan Hee.</font>

281
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

282
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,210
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey! I told you not to drink so much.</font>

283
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,350
<font color="yellow">Give me one, too.</font>

284
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,650
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you coming?</font>

285
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,350
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

286
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,720
<font color="yellow">I just had a strange feeling. You sound really down.</font>

287
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

288
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,990
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

289
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,450
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

290
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,040
<font color="yellow">No, nothing.</font>

291
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,020
<font color="yellow">Looking at how irritated you are, you must be fine.</font>

292
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,580
<font color="yellow">You're so full of energy, you might eat me up alive.</font>

293
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,120
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up. I'm sleepy.</font>

294
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,490
<font color="yellow">Goodnight.</font>

295
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,490
<font color="yellow">All right, put your glasses down.</font>

296
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,800
<font color="yellow">To pay back for all the food I gave you...</font>

297
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,220
<font color="yellow">This is my favourite snack for drinking.</font>

298
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,950
<font color="yellow">You'll have to answer honestly to the questions I ask. Okay?</font>

299
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,490
<font color="yellow">"I like my mum all the time."</font>

300
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,710
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you guys?</font>

301
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,330
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully to what I say.</font>

302
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,850
<font color="yellow">It's not, "Do you like your mum?"</font>

303
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,720
<font color="yellow">I asked you if you like her all the time.</font>

304
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,550
<font color="yellow">Then I'm out.</font>

305
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,150
<font color="yellow">You can take me out.</font>

306
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,150
<font color="yellow">I don't like her all the time.</font>

307
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,970
<font color="yellow">Good, now you're being honest.</font>

308
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,490
<font color="yellow">It's the same for me. I like her in the end,</font>

309
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,450
<font color="yellow">but the process is like torture.</font>

310
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,150
<font color="yellow">Let's...</font>

311
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,770
<font color="yellow">talk behind our mums' backs today.</font>

312
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,280
<font color="yellow">It'll make us feel better,</font>

313
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,040
<font color="yellow">and my writing will be more realistic.</font>

314
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,050
<font color="yellow">I'd appreciate it.</font>

315
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:19,720
<font color="yellow">Here's my second question.</font>

316
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,880
<font color="yellow">What do you like...</font>

317
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,350
<font color="yellow">the least about your mum?</font>

318
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,880
<font color="yellow">- Mum went through tough times.
-  She went through a lot.</font>

319
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,850
<font color="yellow">- But she looks...
-  Her appearance...</font>

320
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,720
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

321
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,350
<font color="yellow">Me? My mum?</font>

322
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,020
<font color="yellow">She loves me too much...</font>

323
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,720
<font color="yellow">So much that it's an obsession.</font>

324
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,820
<font color="yellow">- I don't like that.
-  That's horrible.</font>

325
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
<font color="yellow">Obsession?</font>

326
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,750
<font color="yellow">One time, I was sleeping with my boyfriend.</font>

327
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,780
<font color="yellow">Then I saw my mum's head sticking out from the ceiling...</font>

328
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,050
<font color="yellow">and looking at us.</font>

329
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

330
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,820
<font color="yellow">I got the chills then.</font>

331
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,490
<font color="yellow">I'm getting goosebumps.</font>

332
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,500
<font color="yellow">You're a mama's girl, though.</font>

333
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,380
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, mama's boy.</font>

334
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

335
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,720
<font color="yellow">All right, focus.</font>

336
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,850
<font color="yellow">What would you ask of your mum?</font>

337
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,380
<font color="yellow">Just one thing that you want.</font>

338
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,920
<font color="yellow">Ha Neul, you start.</font>

339
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,720
<font color="yellow">I want her to live long...</font>

340
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,550
<font color="yellow">even if she's sick.</font>

341
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,780
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

342
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,280
<font color="yellow">Let's all have a toast for our mums.</font>

343
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,850
<font color="yellow">- For Mum!
-  For Mum!</font>

344
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,120
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

345
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,920
<font color="yellow">The drinks are going down</font>

346
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,980
<font color="yellow">Gulp, gulp, gulp</font>

347
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
<font color="yellow">Do I have to get up?</font>

348
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,720
<font color="yellow">- Of course. It's a must.
-  Dance.</font>

349
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,370
<font color="yellow">- How long will you make me dance?
-  Good.</font>

350
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to dance forever.</font>

351
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,150
<font color="yellow">Dance to this music.</font>

352
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,520
<font color="yellow">No, not this song.</font>

353
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,780
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

354
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,300
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for the food.
-  Yes, please enjoy.</font>

355
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,650
<font color="yellow">- I already started.
-  Thank you for the food.</font>

356
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,240
<font color="yellow">Yes. Go ahead.</font>

357
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,770
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy the food.
-  Enjoy.</font>

358
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:29,860
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm sorry.</font>

359
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,870
<font color="yellow">I had a shoot today.</font>

360
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,510
<font color="yellow">We're out having dinner now.</font>

361
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,180
<font color="yellow">What? A university hospital? For what?</font>

362
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,010
<font color="yellow">I heard your mum was sick. Is it bad?</font>

363
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,140
<font color="yellow">No, it's stomach ulcer.</font>

364
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,380
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

365
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,480
<font color="yellow">do you know any doctors specializing in liver cancer?</font>

366
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
<font color="yellow">You do?</font>

367
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,640
<font color="yellow">You didn't date him too, did you?</font>

368
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,110
<font color="yellow">If I had two bodies, I would have.</font>

369
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,080
<font color="yellow">What do you need him for?</font>

370
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,410
<font color="yellow">Are you getting a test?</font>

371
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,240
<font color="yellow">Good idea.</font>

372
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,170
<font color="yellow">We're at an age to regularly check our bodies...</font>

373
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,110
<font color="yellow">even if it costs us.</font>

374
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,580
<font color="yellow">You've grown up.</font>

375
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,410
<font color="yellow">You're finally using money on yourself.</font>

376
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,850
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

377
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,640
<font color="yellow">I'll talk to the doctor.</font>

378
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,730
<font color="yellow">He's a really famous guy,</font>

379
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,840
<font color="yellow">so you might have to wait a few days. Is that okay?</font>

380
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:40,180
<font color="yellow">I have no choice. I'll wait if I have to.</font>

381
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,660
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

382
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,910
<font color="yellow">Dae Cheol?</font>

383
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,410
<font color="yellow">He's going to the United States.</font>

384
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,510
<font color="yellow">He wants to see me before he leaves.</font>

385
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,710
<font color="yellow">Should I see him or not?</font>

386
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,950
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about it.</font>

387
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,260
<font color="yellow">You're digging yourself into a hole again.</font>

388
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,500
<font color="yellow">You aren't just thinking about it.</font>

389
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,840
<font color="yellow">You're willing to take back a man who left you.</font>

<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

391
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,280
<font color="yellow">How do you know me so well?</font>

392
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,480
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I don't know about you.</font>

393
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,740
<font color="yellow">You don't know me.</font>

470
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,880
<font color="yellow">I'm not crazy.</font>

471
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,150

-  That's enough.</font>

473
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,170
<font color="yellow">The hospital told her that it was cancer, right?</font>

474
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:05,480
<font color="yellow">But it wasn't when they opened her up?</font>

475
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,680
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

476
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,180

479
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,810
<font color="yellow">The hospital is at fault. They made the wrong diagnosis.</font>

480
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,710
<font color="yellow">That's great. It's great news.</font>

481
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,310
<font color="yellow">Is it serious?</font>

482
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,980
<font color="yellow">It's hard to tell at this stage.</font>

483
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,940
<font color="yellow">Assuming that she's having a hard time differentiating night and day...</font>

484

<font color="yellow">Okay, assuming...</font>

485
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,840
<font color="yellow">It means her dementia is severe.</font>

486
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,150
<font color="yellow">Do you think you'll pass the exams?</font>

487
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,500
<font color="yellow">Of course. Do you think you'll fail?</font>

488

489
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,590
<font color="yellow">I really hope you pass this time.</font>

490
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,180
<font color="yellow">Are you going to take these classes forever?</font>

491
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,810

495
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,440

496
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,780
<font color="yellow">Let's get some tea.</font>

497
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,910
<font color="yellow">I can't. I have the mock exam today.</font>

498
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,680
<font color="yellow">I really have to pass my exams to go to university.</font>

499
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,710
<font color="yellow">I can't have tea right now. I'm sorry.</font>

500
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,050
<font color="yellow">Why are you here anyway?</font>

501
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,510
<font color="yellow">Did you fight with Hee Ja?</font>

502
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,610
<font color="yellow">I'll wait at a nearby café.</font>

503
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,980
<font color="yellow">Call me when you're done.</font>

504
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,380
<font color="yellow">Did you break up with her?</font>

505
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,980
<font color="yellow">What is it? You look so down.</font>

506
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,180
<font color="yellow">What's the problem? You can just date me.</font>

507
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,510
<font color="yellow">Just consider yourself lucky and get yourself a new girl.</font>

510
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,150
<font color="yellow">I'm praying to everything out there to help me pass.</font>

511
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,280
<font color="yellow">It won't help, they're on my side.</font>

512
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,880
<font color="yellow">And I have luck on my side.</font>

524
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work?</font>

525
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
<font color="yellow">I was fired.</font>

<font color="yellow">Be serious. I don't like that kind of humour.</font>

624
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,670
<font color="yellow">Don't laugh. I really don't like it when men...</font>

625
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,640
<font color="yellow">joke about such things.</font>

626
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:29,210
<font color="yellow">My late husband was witty...</font>

627
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,080
<font color="yellow">and he cheated on me.</font>

628
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,410
<font color="yellow">What do you see in our future?</font>

629
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,780
<font color="yellow">I'll go first.</font>

630
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,780
<font color="yellow">How long will I live?</font>

631
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,040
<font color="yellow">Until a ripe, old age?</font>

632
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
<font color="yellow">What a pity.</font>

633
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,580
<font color="yellow">We aren't meant to be.</font>

634
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,910
<font color="yellow">She's a terrible fortune teller.</font>

635
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:54,980
<font color="yellow">She's not.</font>

636
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,210
<font color="yellow">She was quite accurate.</font>

637
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:00,240
<font color="yellow">She said I'd live a long life.</font>

638
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,210
<font color="yellow">I guess that's what you wanted to hear.</font>

639
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you speaking so informally?</font>

640
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,380
<font color="yellow">Did I? I apologise.</font>

641
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,180
<font color="yellow">Let's get one thing straight.</font>

642
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,110
<font color="yellow">I'm older.</font>

643
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,280
<font color="yellow">I don't want you to call me anything corny,</font>

644
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,910
<font color="yellow">but be polite at least.</font>

645
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,480
<font color="yellow">Don't you do that again.</font>

646
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,780
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at so closely?</font>

647
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,840
<font color="yellow">Do you think they're married?</font>

648
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,710
<font color="yellow">They could be friends, like us, or married.</font>

649
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,480
<font color="yellow">As if. I bet they're having an affair.</font>

650
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:45,780
<font color="yellow">They're married or just friends.</font>

651
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:47,380
<font color="yellow">It's an affair.</font>

652
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,010
<font color="yellow">You're quite corrupt.</font>

653
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,740
<font color="yellow">I'd say you have an even dirtier mind.</font>

654
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:04,310
<font color="yellow">Hi, Wan.</font>

655
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,940
<font color="yellow">Don't bring any food.</font>

656
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,220
<font color="yellow">I have to work all night tonight.</font>

657
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,710
<font color="yellow">I'm calling so you won't interrupt.</font>

658
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,440
<font color="yellow">I'm finally getting somewhere now.</font>

659
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,740
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

660
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,310
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to come by anyway.</font>

661
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,840
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

662
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,910
<font color="yellow">I took your advice and am on a date.</font>

663
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,120
<font color="yellow">With whom?</font>

664
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,580
<font color="yellow">One of my customers.</font>

665
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,010
<font color="yellow">You are insane.</font>

666
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,090
<font color="yellow">You don't know what they're like.</font>

667
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,110
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

668
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,380
<font color="yellow">I'm going to have some fun from now on.</font>

669
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,110
<font color="yellow">You are serious.</font>

670
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,080
<font color="yellow">What does he do?</font>

671
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,420
<font color="yellow">He owns a convenience store...</font>

672
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:55,750
<font color="yellow">and has a son in college.</font>

673
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,210
<font color="yellow">He's a widower who plays the guitar...</font>

674
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,210
<font color="yellow">and he's handsome.</font>

675
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:03,310
<font color="yellow">And he's also way younger than I am.</font>

676
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,270
<font color="yellow">Why would such a man date you? You're lying.</font>

677
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:10,310
<font color="yellow">I am not.</font>

678
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,000
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won's calling. I have to go.</font>

679
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,870
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

680
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:17,910
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be out late at night.</font>

681
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,410
<font color="yellow">Hi, Yeong Won.</font>

682
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:29,910
<font color="yellow">Hanyoung University Hospital.</font>

683
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,810
<font color="yellow">Are they good?</font>

684
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,140
<font color="yellow">Do they take good care of patients?</font>

685
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,580
<font color="yellow">Tomorrow?</font>

686
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,540
<font color="yellow">It's a present.</font>

687
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

688
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,580
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I have to work.</font>

689
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,610
<font color="yellow">Just for five minutes.</font>

690
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:59,180
<font color="yellow">I'm very busy.</font>

691
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,070
<font color="yellow">I have to finish this novel by July.</font>

692
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,510
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to go to the beach?</font>

693
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,440
<font color="yellow">I'll wear a bikini.</font>

694
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,010
<font color="yellow">Will you...</font>

695
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,980
<font color="yellow">actually come?</font>

696
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,940
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

697
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,780
<font color="yellow">I'll be waiting.</font>

698
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:23,640
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

699
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,780
<font color="yellow">Don't fall for anyone else.</font>

700
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,380
<font color="yellow">Keep working.</font>

701
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,380
<font color="yellow">(Off to see Yeon Ha!)</font>

702
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,010
<font color="yellow">Seok Gyun.</font>

703
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,310
<font color="yellow">The next time you make doenjang jjigae,</font>

704
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,140
<font color="yellow">add anchovies and...</font>

705
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:06,910
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

706
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,810
<font color="yellow">Did you eat dinner?</font>

707
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,810
<font color="yellow">I'll come by with doenjang jjigae full of anchovies.</font>

708
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,810
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

709
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,610
<font color="yellow">Oh dear.</font>

710
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,380
<font color="yellow">With what?</font>

711
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,240
<font color="yellow">Something weirder than frog meat.</font>

712
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,610
<font color="yellow">Have you ever had doenjang water with blocks of tofu bobbing on top?</font>

713
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,080
<font color="yellow">I'm serious.</font>

714
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,310
<font color="yellow">Don't be too upset.</font>

715
00:51:57,310 --> 00:51:58,880
<font color="yellow">There are drugs these days...</font>

716
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,480
<font color="yellow">that help delay progression.</font>

717
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:06,580
<font color="yellow">Watch your tongue. Don't act like she was diagnosed.</font>

718
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,920
<font color="yellow">Going out and snacking at night...</font>

719
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,280
<font color="yellow">is fine if she's aware of it.</font>

720
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,640
<font color="yellow">You aren't the only one who's sad. I'm sad, too.</font>

721
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,900
<font color="yellow">We'll deal with our emotions later.</font>

722
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:23,200
<font color="yellow">First, we have to see if she knows...</font>

723
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,140
<font color="yellow">what's she's doing or not.</font>

724
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:39,040
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

725
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,810
<font color="yellow">You look so mopy.</font>

726
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:43,840
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

727
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,270
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

728
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,280
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I don't date men?</font>

729
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,780
<font color="yellow">Because men become so frail in old age.</font>

730
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,080
<font color="yellow">I can't stand it. Cheer up.</font>

731
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,380
<font color="yellow">It's me, Choong Nam.</font>

732
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,610
<font color="yellow">Why are you brushing your teeth so hard?</font>

733
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,270
<font color="yellow">You'll wear them away.</font>

734
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,310
<font color="yellow">If I don't brush them properly,</font>

735
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,810
<font color="yellow">I smell of old people.</font>

736
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:35,110
<font color="yellow">Now that we're old, even our breath smells worse.</font>

737
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,540
<font color="yellow">Make the beds. Let's go to bed.</font>

738
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,410
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

739
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:12,310
<font color="yellow">Why are they all sleeping at your place?</font>

740
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,480
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam.</font>

741
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,510
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go travel like them?</font>

742
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:23,540
<font color="yellow">We could get a car...</font>

743
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,840
<font color="yellow">and drive with Jeong A.</font>

744
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,310
<font color="yellow">With Yeong Won and Nan Hee, too.</font>

745
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,210
<font color="yellow">A car? At our age?</font>

746
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,210
<font color="yellow">If you want to buy something,</font>

747
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,440
<font color="yellow">buy your own casket instead.</font>

748
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,880
<font color="yellow">You're so smart and funny.</font>

749
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,240
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty, too.</font>

750
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,180
<font color="yellow">Why did all the men leave you alone?</font>

751
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:51,080
<font color="yellow">Of course they didn't leave me alone.</font>

752
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,380
<font color="yellow">They were all over me.</font>

753
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
<font color="yellow">It was me...</font>

754
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,620
<font color="yellow">who declined them.</font>

755
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,940
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

756
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,710
<font color="yellow">Why did you?</font>

757
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,840
<font color="yellow">You should've let them win you over.</font>

758
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,310
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja.</font>

759
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,010
<font color="yellow">Do you go outside at night?</font>

760
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,640
<font color="yellow">At night?</font>

761
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:18,210
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

762
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,540
<font color="yellow">You don't go to church or anything?</font>

763
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,140
<font color="yellow">I hear a lot of believers go pray at dawn.</font>

764
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,710
<font color="yellow">Don't you go to church?</font>

765
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:28,080
<font color="yellow">I don't like walking in the dark. I don't want to go.</font>

766
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,240
<font color="yellow">Why would you go at night? You can go during the day.</font>

767
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,090
<font color="yellow">How many meals do you have in a day?</font>

768
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,110
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

769
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,840
<font color="yellow">Two?</font>

770
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,310
<font color="yellow">Sometimes three.</font>

771
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,540
<font color="yellow">But I poop all the time.</font>

772
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,040
<font color="yellow">Does this happen to you?</font>

773
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:55,240
<font color="yellow">No, not me.</font>

774
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,010
<font color="yellow">Jeong A says she doesn't either.</font>

775
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,310
<font color="yellow">Yeong Won and Nan Hee doesn't go a lot, too.</font>

776
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,440
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja?</font>

777
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,810
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, come back.</font>

778
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:16,740
<font color="yellow">Come back to bed.</font>

779
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,510
<font color="yellow">I'm Choong Nam.</font>

780
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:21,810
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

781
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,740
<font color="yellow">It's Choong Nam.</font>

782
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,480
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

783
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,410
<font color="yellow">Let's go to sleep.</font>

784
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,280
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't go out at night.</font>

785
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,780
<font color="yellow">Come back here.</font>

786
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:44,240
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't go out.</font>

787
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,180
<font color="yellow">If you go, I'll be scared.</font>

788
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,310
<font color="yellow">I don't like being alone.</font>

789
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:04,240
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja, come here.</font>

790
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,710
<font color="yellow">Let's sleep.</font>

791
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,940
<font color="yellow">Where were you trying to go?</font>

792
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,740
<font color="yellow">The church.</font>

793
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,610
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

794
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:55,310
<font color="yellow">To repent.</font>

795
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,140
<font color="yellow">What's there for you to repent?</font>

796
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,640
<font color="yellow">You're a good person.</font>

797
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,780
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about it.</font>

798
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,040
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja...</font>

799
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,340
<font color="yellow">doesn't remember...</font>

800
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,340
<font color="yellow">what happened...</font>

801
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,560
<font color="yellow">last night?</font>

802
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,910
<font color="yellow">No. She says she slept well.</font>

803
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,740
<font color="yellow">She doesn't remember what we talked about either.</font>

804
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,770
<font color="yellow">We...</font>

805
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,210
<font color="yellow">We should tell her kids.</font>

806
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,770
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

807
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:06,130
<font color="yellow">Let's tell Jeong A first.</font>

808
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,040
<font color="yellow">I think it's better that she tells Min Ho.</font>

809
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,340
<font color="yellow">She's going to be so surprised.</font>

810
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,340
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

811
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,670
<font color="yellow">Call her.</font>

812
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go see Jeong A.</font>

813
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,340
<font color="yellow">Choong Nam, come eat breakfast.</font>

814
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,570
<font color="yellow">I need to make a call.</font>

815
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:43,570
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

816
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,940
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, it's me.</font>

817
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:56,570
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

818
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,140
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

819
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,310
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy?</font>

820
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,170
<font color="yellow">How can you talk nonsense after a meal?</font>

821
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,640
<font color="yellow">Hee Ja has always been strange.</font>

822
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:38,510
<font color="yellow">Even when she was young,</font>

823
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,140
<font color="yellow">she was always a little different.</font>

824
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,540
<font color="yellow">It's not dementia. That's just her.</font>

825
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:46,870
<font color="yellow">Jeong A.</font>

826
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,620
<font color="yellow">- Seong Jae says...
-  What does he know?</font>

827
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,470
<font color="yellow">I know Hee Ja the best. Me.</font>

828
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,170
<font color="yellow">How long did he see her for?</font>

829
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,400
<font color="yellow">Jeong A. He keeps looking at me every day.</font>

830
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,040
<font color="yellow">Close the curtains.</font>

831
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,470
<font color="yellow">Just don't open the curtains.</font>

832
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,570
<font color="yellow">You're so sensitive.</font>

833
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:12,440
<font color="yellow">Then what about the bulbs...</font>

834
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,510
<font color="yellow">that broke when he winked?</font>

835
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:16,240
<font color="yellow">Why did he knock on my door?</font>

836
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,270
<font color="yellow">Do you have dementia?</font>

837
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

838
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:23,240
<font color="yellow">You said you'd meet me at the three way with the pollack.</font>

839
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,840
<font color="yellow">- My goodness.
-  You forgot.</font>

840
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,270
<font color="yellow">You're so out of it.</font>

841
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,840
<font color="yellow">- Where's the pollack?
-  I was wondering why I had it.</font>

842
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,740
<font color="yellow">What a mess. What happened?</font>

843
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:37,570
<font color="yellow">What's the point of acting like you're organised?</font>

844
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,740
<font color="yellow">It's all messy where you can't see it.</font>

845
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,210
<font color="yellow">My stomach hurts so often.</font>

846
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:47,170
<font color="yellow">I don't eat much, but I poop 3 to 4 times a day.</font>

847
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:48,970
<font color="yellow">Why is that?</font>

848
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,110
<font color="yellow">Sleep over tonight.</font>

849
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,470
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

850
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:57,140
<font color="yellow">Jeong A, why are you here and not at your own home?</font>

851
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,870
<font color="yellow">Not again. Just go to sleep.</font>

852
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:14,720
<font color="yellow">I saw her yesterday and the day before.</font>

853
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,670
<font color="yellow">I see her every other day.</font>

854
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,670
<font color="yellow">If she has dementia, then I do, too.</font>

855
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,410
<font color="yellow">The doctor said...</font>

856
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,090
<font color="yellow">it's delusion, not dementia.</font>

857
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,110
<font color="yellow">The doctor said...</font>

858
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,770
<font color="yellow">it's dementia.</font>

859
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:40,410
<font color="yellow">What stupid doctor said that?</font>

860
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,570
<font color="yellow">She took medicine.</font>

861
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:45,410
<font color="yellow">I reminded her to take it whenever I was there,</font>

862
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,770
<font color="yellow">and she would take anything she found lying around.</font>

863
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:51,610
<font color="yellow">She's old. So what if she forgets that...</font>

864
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:52,970
<font color="yellow">we meant to meet up?</font>

865
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:57,510
<font color="yellow">So what if she can't clean her kitchen?</font>

866
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:59,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

867
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,970
<font color="yellow">What should I do, Mum?</font>

868
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:11,970
<font color="yellow">Poor Hee Ja.</font>

869
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,940
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

870
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,470
<font color="yellow">You're wearing what I bought you.</font>

871
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,670
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

872
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:20,770
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Why did you want to die?</font>

873
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,420
<font color="yellow">I can't even change a light bulb.</font>

874
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,270
<font color="yellow">The doctor said I'm delusional.</font>

875
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,210
<font color="yellow">If I end up with dementia,</font>

876
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,540
<font color="yellow">Min Ho will get angry with me.</font>

877
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:35,570
<font color="yellow">Then he'll get exhausted.</font>

878
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,940
<font color="yellow">That's why.</font>

879
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,710
<font color="yellow">You wanted to die with me.</font>

880
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,540
<font color="yellow">What about me, then?</font>

881
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,210
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

882
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,210
<font color="yellow">You're a terrible friend.</font>

883
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,610
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

884
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:50,510
<font color="yellow">I have you, don't I?</font>

885
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,980
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

886
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:24,010
<font color="yellow">Church?</font>

887
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,240
<font color="yellow">To give them the rosaries you made?</font>

888
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,570
<font color="yellow">What will you do after that?</font>

889
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,870
<font color="yellow">I want to see you, of course.</font>

890
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,070
<font color="yellow">Watch out for the cars and be careful.</font>

891
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:44,840
<font color="yellow">Go straight home instead of anywhere else.</font>

892
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,170
<font color="yellow">I'll bring some tteokbokki. You like tteokbokki.</font>

893
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,910
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later.</font>

894
01:07:04,410 --> 01:07:05,810
<font color="yellow">She's going to church.</font>

895
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:10,010
<font color="yellow">She goes there every Friday.</font>

896
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,670
<font color="yellow">It's the evening trips I'm worried about.</font>

897
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:17,240
<font color="yellow">She's fine during the day.</font>

898
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,070
<font color="yellow">Let's go and see Min Ho.</font>

899
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:24,440
<font color="yellow">Let's leave a bit later.</font>

900
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,340
<font color="yellow">I'll wait outside.</font>

901
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:59,840
<font color="yellow">(Hospital)</font>

902
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,480
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

903
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,410
<font color="yellow">when can I have surgery?</font>

904
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:14,110
<font color="yellow">You need it soon.</font>

905
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:16,910
<font color="yellow">But my schedule's...</font>

906
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,340
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

907
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,640
<font color="yellow">What? Why are the onions rotten?</font>

908
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:26,980
<font color="yellow">Throw them out.</font>

909
01:08:26,980 --> 01:08:29,270
<font color="yellow">Call the Jeju Brothers and ask them...</font>

910
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,910
<font color="yellow">to bring some urgently.</font>

911
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:35,010
<font color="yellow">Don't try to save anything. Throw everything out.</font>

912
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,410
<font color="yellow">You'll just waste time.</font>

913
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:39,670
<font color="yellow">I'm the boss, not you.</font>

914
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,840
<font color="yellow">Basically, you're in the worst place possible.</font>

915
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:47,980
<font color="yellow">It's not just the liver.</font>

916
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,340
<font color="yellow">It has spread all over.</font>

917

<font color="yellow">(Yeong Won)</font>

918
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,040
<font color="yellow">If it's so urgent,</font>

919
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,710
<font color="yellow">why must I wait three weeks?</font>

920
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:12,040
<font color="yellow">He just wants me to die, not live.</font>

921
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,070
<font color="yellow">But then again, I'm not his only patient.</font>

922

<font color="yellow">(Wan)</font>

923
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,740
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

924
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,770
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

925
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,740
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

926
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,770
<font color="yellow">"What?"</font>

927
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:38,910
<font color="yellow">"What?"</font>

928
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,980
<font color="yellow">Is that all you can say right now?</font>

929
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:45,170
<font color="yellow">I'll be there.</font>

930
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:48,670
<font color="yellow">You know how busy this place gets at lunchtime.</font>

931
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,770
<font color="yellow">I dropped by on my way to the publisher's.</font>

932
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:55,640
<font color="yellow">I can't leave when everyone's so busy.</font>

933
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,210
<font color="yellow">Where on earth are you?</font>

934
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,240
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

935
