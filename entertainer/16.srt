00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,380
Hello, I'm Jo Sung Hyun's friend, Shin Suk Ho.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,810
I leave this message because I really want to meet you.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,450
I understand why you couldn't sing your favourite song...

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,710
and lived in hiding for these many years.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,450
I'd like to meet you, just once.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,880
I'll wait until you come.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,980
Please. I beg of you.

8
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,650
How much is it?

9
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,610
I thought you couldn't make it.

10
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,110
I'm sure it was difficult.

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,250
Thank you for coming.

12
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,410
This year,

13
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,710
so many people are looking for me.

14
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,380
Is it time?

15
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,310
I'm afraid.

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,110
- Sir.
- I know what you want.

17
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,350
The longer you wait, the more you'll be disappointed.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
I can't do...

19
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,680
what you want. I came to tell you that.

20
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,180
Can you reconsider?

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,550
I know I have no right to say this.

22
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Didn't you...

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,720
retire and don't you live in hiding because it's too difficult for you?

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,450
I loved singing.

25
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,720
However,

26
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,280
that one wrong choice...

27
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,450
made it impossible for me to sing any more.

28
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,080
I thought about what would happen...

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,680
to my remaining years if I were to come clean now.

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,780
It would be even more pathetic.

31
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,550
Please. Please, I beg of you.

32
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,810
A long time ago, I made a promise.

33
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,750
I promised to have Ha Neul sing Sung Hyun's song on stage some day.

34
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,280
I said it like a joke,

35
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,880
but now, that promise...

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,450
has become my life.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,550
Please.

38
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,310
Please, I beg of you.

39
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,850
I don't want my family to know about my disgraceful act.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
This is...

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,080
all the royalties I've received for "Go Ahead, Cry".

42
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,750
I didn't use a dime.

43
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,380
It should be quite a bit.

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,180
Before I found out about Jo Ha Neul,

45
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,280
I saved it to donate it somewhere.

46
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,980
Please give it to Jo Ha Neul, Jo Sung Hyun's brother.

47
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,050
I came to give you this.

48
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,250
Goodbye, then.

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,480
You give it to him yourself.

50
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,050
He won't accept it from me.

51
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,210
And this is my number.

52
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,110
I'm sure you won't want to see me,

53
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,710
but I will look for you again.

54
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,480
Please reconsider and give me a call.

55
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,180
I'll be waiting.

56
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,550
I'm leaving tomorrow.

57
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,810
If he won't accept it, donate it somewhere.

58
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,520
Is it someone's birthday?

59
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
Ha Neul, is it your birthday?

60
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,750
It's the anniversary of Ha Neul's brother, Sung Hyun's passing.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,110
Stop doing this every year.

62
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,450
We went to see him in the columbarium today.

63
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,180
Your mum used to prepare much more when she was alive.

64
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,450
Half of these are store-bought. I couldn't cook it all.

65
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
Hey. I'm disappointed.

66
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,020
You should've brought us if you were going to your brother...

67
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,750
and introduced us.

68
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
He's right. I want to meet him.

69
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,780
Let's go in the morning.

70
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,110
I'm off tomorrow.

71
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,450
It's okay. Let's just rehearse.

72
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,580
Hey.

73
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,650
Aren't we family?

74
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,980
Do we need to have the same parents to be family?

75
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,450
Geu Rin.

76
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,180
Ha Neul is practising tomorrow, so take just us.

77
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,380
We want to meet Sung Hyun.

78
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,710
Imagine how good he'll feel if he meets me.

79
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,380
Let's go, Ha Neul.

80
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,880
The food's getting cold. Let's eat.

81
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,710
Thank you, Sung Hyun.

82
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,550
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

83
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,980
Yum.

84
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,150
This is so tasty.

85
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,610
That's store-bought.

86
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:11,810
The soup is salty.

87
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,180
I made that.

88
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,510
Yum.

89
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,910
Thanks.

90
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,910
This is nothing compared to what your mum made for my parents.

91
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,910
Ha Neul's entire family must have been nice.

92
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,650
I guess that's why you are, too.

93
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,810
It's Mr Shin.

94
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,750
Hello?

95
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,080
I just met Choi Joon Ha.

96
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,110
I begged,

97
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,150
but it's as we expected.

98
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,710
It'll be hard.

99
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,210
He's known to be a singer-songwriter.

100
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,280
Asking him to tell the world his song was written by someone else...

101
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,980
is like asking him to strip naked in front of the public.

102
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,180
If he says he can't do it himself,

103
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,380
what if we play dirty...

104
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:09,210
and have Ha Neul go public with Sung Hyun's original score?

105
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,650
Who would believe that?

106
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,180
There's no way to prove the date of creation.

107
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,350
There is.

108
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,980
What?

109
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,250
Suk Ho...

110
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,580
had me record Sung Hyun play the song.

111
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,050
Wait.

112
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,180
Did you record it?

113
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,450
You said you couldn't.

114
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,410
Joon Suk doesn't know I recorded it either.

115
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,710
I'm ashamed.

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,280
I should've told you everything,

117
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,550
but I couldn't.

118
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,010
I wasn't as brave as you.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
When I was your age,

120
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,210
why did I run away?

121
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,750
Are you saying the video has a time and date stamp?

122
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,780
It should have the date and time.

123
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,710
Then that settles it.

124
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,950
We have the sheet music and a video as proof.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,680
Suk Ho, you don't look like you want to do it.

126
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,480
Why not?

127
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,150
This is the only way to return Sung Hyun's song to him.

128
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,580
It's the only way Ha Neul can sing...

129
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,480
his song freely on "Legend Again".

130
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,210
- Let's not do that.
- Mr Shin.

131
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,980
Think it over.

132
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
We have a way. Why would we not do it?

133
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,120
If we do that,

134
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:57,710
it will destroy Choi Joon Ha's entire life, not just his career.

135
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,550
Let's not kill Choi Joon Ha just to save Sung Hyun's song.

136
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,010
Choi Joon Ha is leaving the country tomorrow.

137
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,710
We need to find another way.

138
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,310
We don't have time.

139
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,210
Didn't you gather us because you had an idea?

140
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,910
What is it? What should we do?

141
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,410
An opportunity. We need to find an opportunity.

142
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,080
We need to make him want to sing again.

143
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,650
I'm sure he's just hiding but still loves to sing.

144
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,580
How will we find that opportunity?

145
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,850
He's leaving tomorrow. We don't have much time.

146
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,480
That's why I gathered you all.

147
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,580
We need to check all night.

148
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,510
Check all the portals and find every interview,

149
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,250
TV show, every song he ever sang,

150
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,010
whatever it may be.

151
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,580
Find the way to bring out...

152
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,780
the entertainer spirit within him.

153
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,550
It's too hard.

154
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,880
We must find it.

155
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,280
How many laptops do we have? Tablets?

156
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,910
We don't have time, so let's split up the years.

157
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,380
Okay.

158
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,810
Geu Rin, come with me.

159
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,120
Are you disappointed?

160
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,980
Yes.

161
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,350
If you only look at the results,

162
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,250
we'll become just like Lee Joon Suk.

163
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,350
I really want to convince Choi Joon Ha.

164
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,810
Please help me.

165
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,150
What if...

166
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,180
What if we can't convince him and he leaves?

167
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,910
Can you promise to reconsider then?

168
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
We will.

169
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,880
Let's have faith.

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
And...

171
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
here.

172
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,310
Give it to Ha Neul.

173
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,950
Thanks.

174
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,310
(YEO MIN JOO)

175
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,710
The resolution is poor.

176
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,010
Sung Hyun's audio recording is in there, too.

177
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,710
Listen to it when you want.

178
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,950
Sung Hyun...

179
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,110
sang so well.

180
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,310
I'm sure...

181
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,180
you've suffered a lot, too.

182
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

183
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,310
I thought...

184
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,680
I'd always keep this to myself.

185
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,410
I have a feeling...

186
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,610
Sung Hyun helped me...

187
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,010
meet you again...

188
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,350
and meet Ha Neul.

189
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,980
Seoul Theatre of the Arts.

190
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,610
Seoul Theatre of the Arts.

191
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,080
What? What?

192
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,780
This was his first concert.

193
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,350
It snowed a lot, so traffic was paralysed.

194
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,910
Probably because it was Christmas Eve, too.

195
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,210
"I was very upset."

196
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,510
"The tickets were sold, but I wondered if the fans would come."

197
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,880
"The roads are jammed and the weather was terrible."

198
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,250
"I wondered if half would come. No, if even 10 would come."

199
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,310
"But I was truly moved."

200
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,210
"The seats were all filled."

201
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,450
"I started to tear up."

202
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,080
"It took me a while to calm my emotions and start the first song."

203
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,880
"It was a two-hour concert, but I think I sang for five."

204
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,650
"I was willing to stay up all night with my fans."

205
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,780
"That's how it went."

206
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,410
"I will never forget that day."

207
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,380
Min Joo, find out what time his flight is.

208
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,710
Geu Rin, wait with Ha Neul. He must be worried.

209
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,480
Man Shik, go to the airport with me.

210
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,750
We need to stop him.

211
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,750
You go to Seoul Theatre of the Arts.

212
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,080
I want to show him that stage again.

213
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,610
Okay.

214
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,580
Hey. Let's say we find him.

215
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,310
Then what? Will we abduct him?

216
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,080
We should show it to him.

217
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,350
Let's get moving.

218
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,550
I'll call the airlines.

219
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,580
Let's go.

220
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,810
What's this?

221
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,680
It's the royalties from...

222
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,950
"Go Ahead, Cry".

223
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,350
Did Suk Ho meet Choi Joon Ha?

224
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,680
- Yes.
- What did he say?

225
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,850
He explained and begged,

226
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,750
but he said he doesn't think he can undo it.

227
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,050
I know you're angry. So am I.

228
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,180
How dare he give this to him?

229
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,080
He must have struggled, too.

230
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,280
He didn't spend a dime.

231
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,180
I think he was going to donate it somewhere.

232
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,050
He's so selfish.

233
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,750
Everyone is selfish. Only the dead suffers.

234
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,480
He's trying to relieve himself of his guilt.

235
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,580
Why did Suk Ho accept this?

236
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,850
Are we leaving now?

237
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,910
Let's give Ha Neul some time.

238
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,280
Did something happen again?

239
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
What is this?

240
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:47,210
I'll explain later. Go back to sleep.

241
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,850
Okay.

242
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,610
Okay. Good night.

243
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,250
There are three flights throughout the day, but we don't know which.

244
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
We'll have to wait.

245
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,510
I hope we can even meet him, but can we convince him?

246
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,110
May we go onto the stage?

247
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,880
- What is this about?
- Well...

248
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,080
We'll be brief.

249
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:48,080
Someone really has to see the stage.

250
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,580
Do you have an upcoming performance?

251
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,820
No, that's not it.

252
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,680
Please.

253
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,750
Showing it to you isn't hard,

254
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,410
but you need to let me know in advance if you want to perform.

255
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,650
It's being torn down after this year and rebuilt.

256
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,950
I see.

257
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,950
I guess it's not the morning flight.

258
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,820
- I think they've all gone in.
- I guess.

259
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,080
Let's eat something.

260
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,750
We need our energy.

261
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,250
Okay.

262
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,450
Yes, Gil Joo.

263
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,210
Yes.

264
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,710
A reconstruction?

265
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,450
A reconstruction?

266
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,550
Yes.

267
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Okay.

268
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,350
A reconstruction?

269
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,450
Yes.

270
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,450
It'll be open until the end of the year and they'll rebuild it.

271
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,250
I hope Choi Joon Ha gets over everything...

272
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,450
and holds a concert there before it gets rebuilt.

273
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,050
That'd be nice.

274
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,780
Gosh.

275
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Shall we go in?

276
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Just wait.

277
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,210
You should drive.

278
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,080
Geu Rin stayed up all night.

279
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,410
I'm all right.

280
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,380
No, you're not. You look like a panda with those dark circles.

281
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,910
Where is Suk Ho?

282
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,820
- At the airport.
- And the envelope?

283
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,510
In your desk drawer.

284
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,610
Where are you going?

285
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,380
I'll go by myself.

286
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,650
Don't worry. Just stay home.

287
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,710
We meet again.

288
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,050
I understand...

289
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,610
that they are both very important to you.

290
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:34,450
But this is how far I'm willing to understand.

291
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,550
Please, step aside.

292
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,450
I said everything I needed to say. Let me just give you this.

293
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,550
Please, take it.

294
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,680
And...

295
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,350
please watch the video...

296
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,410
in this USB.

297
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll go some place quiet and take a look.

298
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Bye then.

300
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
- I'm Jo Ha Neul.
- It's Jo Ha Neul!

301
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,780
- It's Jo Ha Neul.
- I'm your fan!

302
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,580
I'm sorry.

303
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
About what?

304
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,450
Are you sorry about what happened in 2005...

305
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,380
or for not setting the record straight now?

306
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,710
I'm not sure.

307
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm sorry about both.

308
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,210
Are you trying to say sorry with this?

309
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,910
I'm returning that money...

310
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,380
because it isn't mine.

311
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,250
But why aren't you returning the song?

312
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,650
"Go Ahead, Cry" is still your song.

313
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Even after your death,

314
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,080
that song will still be yours, Sir.

315
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,710
Why...

316
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
can't you return the song?

317
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,080
Don't call me "Sir".

318
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,710
I don't deserve...

319
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,280
such respect.

320
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,810
Also,

321
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,550
I don't have the courage.

322
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,280
This is the best I can do.

323
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,510
I'm not asking you to bring my brother back to life.

324
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,210
I don't want this money.

325
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,380
Taking this money won't bring my brother back.

326
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,050
I don't need this.

327
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,410
I don't resent you.

328
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,250
I blame myself...

329
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,250
for being too young and not being able to...

330
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,510
help my vulnerable brother.

331
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,450
It's time for me to check in.

333
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,480
If you won't take the money,

334
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,750
I'll donate it to charity under your name.

335
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,910
"Go Ahead, Cry".

336
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,980
I'll sing it.

337
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll sing it on "Legend Again".

338
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,680
They'll applaud thinking that it's your song.

339
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,250
But I know,

340
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,250
you know...

341
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,110
and Lee Joon Suk knows...

342
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,110
whose song that really is.

343
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,450
I'll pray until the last minute before going on the stage.

344
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,810
That you walk out...

345
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,180
of your misery yourself.

346
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,950
I'll pray that the song I sing...

347
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,810
finds it's real owner.

348
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,550
Please,

349
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,750
prove that you are different...

350
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,950
from Lee Joon Suk.

351
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,710
Did you meet him?

352
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,180
Later.

353
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,280
I'll tell you later.

354
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,510
Let me take a nap.

355
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,250
Let's go practise.

356
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,850
Ha Neul says he'll sing the song.

357
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,180
Yes, let's go practise.

358
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,910
We'll go by ourselves. You should get some sleep.

359
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,810
- Let's go.
- Okay.

360
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,910
Get some rest.

361
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,650
My worries are nothing.

362
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,780
You and Ha Neul...

363
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,810
This is terrible.

364
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,910
What about you?

365
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,810
What happened with KTOP?

366
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,380
I cancelled my contract and left.

367
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,680
There will be a press release soon.

368
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,810
What about Jackson?

369
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,910
They say they'll leave with me.

370
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,510
I told them they should stay.

371
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,550
They just need to find a new vocalist.

372
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,080
They wouldn't do that.

373
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,050
Because their trust must've been shattered.

374
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,810
Just worry about yourself and Ha Neul.

375
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,480
It was all a disaster.

376
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:36,710
I was busy getting ready to go study abroad without knowing that.

377
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,850
I was going to look into it for you.

378
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,910
Where will you go?

379
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,010
To England.

380
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,610
It's the country of the Beatles.

381
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,910
Jinu.

382
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,110
Let's...

383
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,180
give "Don't Touch" back.

384
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:10,380
Let's give the song back to its composer.

385
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,110
Suk Ho, I...

386
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,680
I don't have courage to do that.

387
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
I'm not sure if I can do it.

388
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,810
I'm sorry, Suk Ho.

389
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,080
Ha Neul's brother, Sung Hyun...

390
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,050
I saw a video of him singing and recording the song.

391
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,380
After seeing that video,

392
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,110
I was reminded of the composer who wrote "Don't Touch".

393
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,850
I'm sorry for making you feel burdened.

394
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,010
I'm sorry.

395
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,250
What's that? Is that for Suk Ho again?

396
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,110
My body aches, too.

397
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,110
Can't you see there are two?

398
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:23,380
You are taking care of both Suk Ho and me. Is that it?

399
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,750
Being an heiress makes you so generous.

400
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,280
I told you not to mention that.

401
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,710
Okay, I'll try.

402
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,610
Don't try. Just don't mention it.

403
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,280
If you say that again, I won't talk to you.

404
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,780
I'm going to take this.

405
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,350
Where's Suk Ho? Is he not back yet?

406
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,280
He's not. I don't know where he is.

407
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,950
Is he sleeping at the office again?

408
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,150
It has already gone up in smoke. He won't be able to find a solution.

409
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,910
I'll get going.

410
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,180
You're leaving already?

411
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,650
I need to take some rest.

412
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,680
I haven't slept at all.

413
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,750
Oh, dear. It's raining. I didn't bring an umbrella.

414
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,810
An umbrella? I should have one. Give me a second.

415
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,710
- There it is.
- Sorry?

416
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,010
No, no.

417
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,250
You can't take that one.

418
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,950
What's the problem? It's just an umbrella.

419
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,680
I'll give you another one. You can't take that one.

420
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,150
Is it yours?

421
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,150
Suk Ho cherishes it.

422
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,280
It's just an umbrella.

423
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,780
I don't know what it is.

424
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,380
I thought he only collects baseball caps,

425
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,250
but that umbrella is as important to him.

426
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,210
He was drying it up so that it doesn't rust.

427
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,110
Does he collect umbrellas?

428
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,810
He's odd.

429
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,150
Find another one for me, then. My car is parked far away.

430
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,280
Oh, all right.

431
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,050
I left the green umbrella at home.

432
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,050
Why is it raining?

433

434
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,750
Hello?

435
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,810
This place hasn't changed.

436
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,410
Is this Mr Choi Joon Ha?

437
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,910
It snowed...

438
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,650
that day.

439
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,550
It's raining today.

440
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,750
Would I be able to come here...

441
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,510
and sing before this theatre disappears?

442
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,680
I'd like to plan a concert for you.

443
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,810
I'm not what people think I am. Who would come to my concert?

444
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,880
It'll be a full house...

445
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,580
like the day it was snowing.

446
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,150
The fans who were waiting for you then...

447
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,380
are still waiting for you.

448
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,480
I'll make sure...

449
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,680
that you perform in that concert hall again.

450
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,580
What must I do?

451
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,010
I met Choi Joon Ha.

452
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,110
Really?

453
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,680
Ha Neul met him, too.

454
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,910
Was he in Korea?

455
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,280
How did you meet him?

456
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,980
What did he say? Is he going to confess?

457
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,480
Geu Rin and Ha Neul played a big part in convincing him.

458
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,150
We just need to prepare for a great performance, then!

459
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,780
This is a relief.

460
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,310
We'll be at ease when we perform the song.

461
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,910
I didn't know you'll be able to do it.

462
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,680
You're incredible.

463
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,950
I didn't do anything.

464
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,810
So...

465
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,380
we're going to issue a statement containing the truth about the song.

466
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,610
Choi Joon Ha will not be interviewed.

467
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,080
That's too much to ask of him.

468
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,310
The press release will be written in Ha Neul's perspective.

469
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,780
We'll reveal that they're brothers.

470
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,510
The focus...

471
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,450
will be the fact that he got his brother's song back after a decade.

472
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,350
And that...

473
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,410
he will stand on the stage and perform his brother's song.

474
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,310
We don't have much time left.

475
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,680
I know you guys work hard but let's work even harder this time,

476
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,310
and make sure we can live up to the composer's legacy.

477
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,410
Start practising.

478
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,410
I have to meet some reporters.

479
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,010
Mr Shin, I'll drive you.

480
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,680
It's okay. Order something for these guys.

481
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,410
You should stay here today.

482
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,710
See you later.

483
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,050
Which one am I supposed to be more surprised about?

484
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,010
Are you saying...

485
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:36,010
that legendary song is not Choi Joon Ha's?

486
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,010
And the song was written by Jo Ha Neul's brother?

487
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,080
For goodness' sake.

488
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,410
I've never seen something like this in my years of working here.

489
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,650
What a coincidence. Or is this bad luck?

490
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:51,250
I'm discussing this with you before we release an official statement.

491
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,310
We have to perform on this show. Put in a good word for us.

492
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,850
I don't need to.

493
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,050
People will be talking about it even before we air it.

494
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,880
We'll take it any time.

495
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,210
Anyhow,

496
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,210
- did you actually meet him?
- Yes.

497
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,910
Did he really agree to this?

498
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,950
This sounds like a fraud at a national scale.

499
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,410
He had to think about it a lot.

500
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,750
He had a hard time facing the truth for over 10 years.

501
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,180
This shouldn't be featured on a music programme.

502
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,580
It should be aired on a documentary.

503
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,380
Can you set up the stage so that it creates a warm atmosphere?

504
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:33,080
Is there something that'll make news?

505
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,150
Yes, it's me.

506
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,480
How's the reporter who lost his chance at producing...

507
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,780
an exclusive article on Ha Neul last time?

508
00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:00,110
This office looks so unique.

509
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,410
It's small,

510
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,950
but there are a lot of rare items.

511
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,580
Wow.

512
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,880
This is probably not a coincidence.

513
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,410
You fooled me last time but I heard you have something for me today.

514
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,910
Do you still write about scandals and get paid under the table?

515
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,010
Why...

516
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,010
are you bringing up what's happened in the past?

517
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,350
If I wrote about your past,

518
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,310
I could do it for a month.

519
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,610
I invited you over to reconcile with you.

520
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,450
Why are you in a bad mood?

521
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,480
What is it?

522
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,610
My boss told me you have something for me.

523
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,280
Is there more to Jo Ha Neul?

524
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,650
It's about Choi Joon Ha.

525
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,250
Choi Joon Ha?

526
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,480
Is he back?

527
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,650
What does he have to do with Mango Entertainment?

528
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,250
Did you talk this over with him?

529
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,110
I have a favour to ask of you.

530
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,880
It's not a report.

531
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,310
Make this an emotional confession.

532
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,410
It took him a lot to do this.

533
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
The composer...

534
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,910
is Ha Neul's brother?

535
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,980
Are you okay, Ha Neul?

536
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,180
We can take a break if you want.

537
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,280
Yes, Min Joo. Where are you?

538
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,680
At the office? That's good.

539
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,080
If you open the drawer by my desk, there's a USB.

540
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,610
Can you bring it with the laptop to the studio?

541
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,720
Yes.

542
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,010
There it is.

543
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,810
Suk Ho cherishes it.

544
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,150
It's just an umbrella.

545
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,180
I thought he only collects baseball caps,

546
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,910
but that umbrella is as important to him.

547
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,850
He was drying it up so that it doesn't rust.

548
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,180
I'll head to the nursing home.

549
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,150
I'm sure Mr Shin hasn't slept or showered in days.

550
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,780
Geu Rin.

551
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,950
The umbrella is green.

552
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,610
Drink this.

553
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,150
I'm okay.

554
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,010
You're here.

555
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,250
Suk Ho asked me to come.

556
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,310
There's a video in here.

557
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,110
He said I should show it to Ha Neul.

558
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,280
Sung Hyun.

559
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,780
Sung Hyun.

560
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,150
Sung Hyun, why...

561
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,910
Why are you there?

562
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,850
Sung Hyun.

563
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,380
Sung Hyun.

564
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,080
Sung Hyun.

566
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,110
Sung Hyun.

567
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,010
Why can't you sing?

568
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,910
Sung Hyun can, why can't you?

569
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,720
Sung Hyun's not here.

570
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,050
But this song must be sung.

571
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,220
Why can't you sing it?

572
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,810
There is only one person...

573
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,880
who should sing this song. That is you, Jo Ha Neul.

574
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,980
There will be a press release today.

575
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,650
"Go Ahead, Cry"...

576
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,720
is not Choi Joon Ha's, but Jo Sung Hyun's song.

577
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,050
Jo Sung Hyun is Entertainer Band's Jo Ha Neul's brother.

578
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,250
Sung Hyun lost his song to KTOP and passed away.

579
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,350
What shall we do now?

580
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,810
You'll be in pain,

581
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,180
your heart will break and you'll run out of breath.

582
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,350
But you must sing it well.

583
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,220
Because it's Sung Hyun's song.

584
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,650
(JO HA NEUL MUST BE FURIOUS. THE GUY KILLED HIS BROTHER.)

585
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,910
I'm going to drop by. Would you like to have a drink?

586
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,350
I'm planning on drinking tonight.

587
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,950
Julia,

588
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,450
are you still awake?

589
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,810
You must be in a state of shock.

590
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,210
Sweety, I always thought you were the best.

591
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,350
And today, you are even greater.

592
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,150
You've done the right thing.

593
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,410
James is really proud of your courage, too.

594
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,350
He kept telling me how much he misses you.

595
00:45:02,050 --> 00:45:03,280
Thank you for saying that.

596
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,710
I really mean it.

597
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,380
So, please, come back.

598
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:09,810
Let's take a break and go somewhere.

599
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,550
Yes,

600
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,680
I'll be home in no time.

601
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,650
Get some sleep. Good night.

602
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,710
Love you.

603
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,780
We can have a drink when you visit me in Australia.

604
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,910
I have a favour to ask you.

605
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,980
Why is everyone being so stupid and causing trouble?

606
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,480
Why? Why?

607
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:54,610
I'm sorry, Sir.

608
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,810
Did you check on other singers' and actors' positions?

609
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:00,750
The studios notified us of cancelling...

610
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:03,110
all music programmes and variety shows with us.

611
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:08,410
The actors and singers who were planning to renew their contracts...

612
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,180
said they wouldn't.

613
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,450
Tell them we'll modify the terms all on their favour.

614
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,110
Make them re-sign even if it means giving them exceptional offers.

615
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,750
Yes, Sir. I'll meet them and discuss it.

616
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:19,910
Leave.

617
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:33,310
You heard that, right? He won't be able to handle it alone.

618
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,810
You should meet every one them and resolve it.

619
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,950
There's something I need to say.

620
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,410
This is how far I'll go with KTOP.

621
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,780
Please accept the resignation letter I submitted.

622
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,880
What will you do after you leave?

623
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,480
I didn't make you the director because you were competent.

624
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,080
Nobody will take you in.

625
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,680
Snap out of it, Joo Han.

626
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,810
Yes, Sir.

627
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,510
That's why I'm quitting.

628
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,210
I know that the director position doesn't suit me.

629
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,180
I want to start over...

630
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,210
like Suk Ho.

631
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,710
You are all crazy.

632
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,380
Do you think you're something?

633
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,510
I learned a lot from you, thanks.

634
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,210
I have a favour to ask you.

635
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:58,780
Can I...

636
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,610
be on "Legend Again"?

637
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,750
There isn't a day without crisis. What's wrong this time?

638
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,550
I need to go to the studio.

639
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,610
When will Suk Ho's life find peace?

640
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,610
Choi Joon Ha himself will be on stage?

641
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,010
That's perfect for us.

642
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,110
Would Ha Neul agree to this?

643
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,880
I was thinking if you can make it a duet performance.

644
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,010
A duet? For Joon Ha and Ha Neul?

645
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,310
Let's talk for a second.

646
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,450
Kyle, let's arrange this again.

647
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,110
Pardon?

648
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,910
I didn't really touch it.

649
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:18,610
We were just practising Ha Neul's brother's version.

650
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:21,080
Leave the same feel but make it a duet.

651
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:23,250
A duet? For whom?

652
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,280
We have less than a week left. Kyle, can you do it?

653
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,710
What are you talking about?

654
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,250
Whom am I singing this with?

655
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,080
Are you going to tell me to sing this with Choi Joon Ha?

656
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,410
No,

657
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,080
this is a joint performance...

658
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,350
between you and Sung Hyun like we've promised.

659
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,010
Sung Hyun.

660
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,850
These are my friends.

661
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:04,080
You know we're in a band together, right?

662
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:07,450
Hello, Sung Hyun.

663
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,580
We'll be performing your song today.

664
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,410
I'm honoured.

665
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,210
I arranged it a bit,

666
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,180
and it's much...

667
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,610
- Kyle.
- What?

668
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,310
Let me finish.

669
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,610
It'll never be as good as the original version.

670
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,810
Please cheer us on though.

671
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:32,480
Sung Hyun, I have to be honest about this.

672
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,510
Ha Neul looks better than you.

673
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,510
Hey.

674
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:41,210
- What?
- I agree with you.

675
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:47,780
I've never seen you in person,

676
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,480
but I saw many pictures of you and heard a lot about you.

677
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,410
I feel like you're my real brother.

678
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,080
Look forward to...

679
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,180
Ha Neul's performance.

This is it.

(JO SUNG HYUN, ENTERTAINER BAND)

685
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,780
You look more nervous than usual.

686
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,710
Are you nervous?

687
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:38,850
A bit.

688
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:41,250
It feels funny.

689
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:58,680
Thank you...

690
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,610
for letting me be here.

691
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,110
Thank you...

692
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,010
for returning my brother's song.

693
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:07,750
I gave it back after I took it from him. You shouldn't thank me.

694
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,150
I don't deserve it.

695
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:14,410
Thank you for dragging me out...

696
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:16,110
of a prison I built for myself.

697
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,410
I'll see you on stage.

698
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,380
You might beat me up for this but I'm going to say it, anyway.

699
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,880
He looks so cool.

700
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,580
You punk.

701
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,750
- What are you doing?
- What?

702
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,110
Shut your mouth.

703
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:47,580
The next performance is the one you've been anticipating for.

704
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,410
Not long ago, it was revealed that this song is not Choi Joon Ha's,

705
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,950
but belongs to a young man who is...

706
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,050
the brother of Entertainer Band's Jo Ha Neul.

707
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,950
Choi Joon Ha made the confession himself.

708
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,010
Today,

709
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:07,450
we have Choi Joon Ha here.

710
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,610
Let's welcome him on stage.

711
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,610
I'm sorry to be back on stage after 11 years...

712
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,480
and not being better off.

713
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,510
I know some of you may not want to see me on stage,

714
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,710
but I decided...

715
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,110
to be here for a reason.

716
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,210
I left...

717
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,080
without even saying goodbye.

718
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,410
My fans waited 11 years...

719
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,480
not knowing what happened to me.

720
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,110
And now, I'm back with disgraceful news.

721
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,010
I'm...

722
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,050
embarrassed.

723
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,010
But I wanted to summon up the courage...

724
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,880
to see you...

725
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:48,680
in person and apologise for what I've done.

726
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,780
I wanted...

727
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,710
to bid my farewell formally.

728
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,710
That's why I'm here.

729
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,910
I apologise for what I've done,

730
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,080
and I'll live...

731
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,880
the rest of my life...

732
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,980
reflecting on my mistake.

733
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,880
I don't deserve this honour,

734
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,880
but please allow me to introduce him.

735
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,180
He's the rightful owner of "Go Ahead, Cry".

736
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,310
It's Jo Sung Hyun.

737
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,850
(JO SUNG HYUN)

738
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,110
(ENTERTAINER BAND)

739
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,610
I miss you, Sung Hyun.
