<i>[EPISODE 15]</i>

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,110
What the heck?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,910
Who are you!

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,040
Lee Joon Suk!

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,760
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?
Why did you do it? Why did you do it?

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,250
Why did you do it!

8
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,980
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,100
What did you say to Sung Hyun?

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,920
What, exactly, did you say to Sung Hyun?

11
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,900
What do you think I said to Sung Hyun?

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,420
What do you think I said to a man
who couldn't even control his body?

13
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,110
Don't do it!

14
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,740
Hey, this guy called you a...

15
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,150
Hey, say it again.
Just try and say it again!

16
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,220
If you do this, Suk Ho...

17
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,380
I become a pitiful person.

18
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,430
I won't make you a pitiful person.

19
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,400
It is quite comical
to see you behave this way.

20
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,450
I don't know about anyone else,
but it's funny for you to be this way.

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,580
Do you have the right to act like this?

22
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,260
<i>My life depends on that song.</i>

23
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,860
Jin Woo can release something next time.

24
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,610
Are you this stupid?

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,210
What good would come from this?

26
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,430
This money is much more than the pay
for composing one song.

27
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,720
You can make more than this.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,840
There's the next album too!

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,830
You will be punished.

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,280
No matter how crappy this world is,
you will be punished.

31
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,890
You will receive the punishment
that you deserve.

32
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,210
As for my punishment...

33
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,740
I will get what I deserve.

34
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,660
What will happen if Jo Ha Neul
sings "It's Okay to Cry"?

35
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't give up on "Legend Again".

36
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,620
I'm looking forward to seeing
a comedy show.

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,660
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,150
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,930
It must've been so hard for you.

40
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,790
It must've been so difficult...

41
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,560
It must've been so hard...

42
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,390
I'm sorry I couldn't
be there with you, Sung Hyun.

43
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,450
I'm so sorry.

44
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,930
Gosh, that punk.

45
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,010
Look at the time. Geez.

46
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,370
Hey, are you just getting in now?

47
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,770
Did you spend the night
in the office again?

48
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,030
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

49
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,810
I guess he's really tired.

50
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,110
Get some rest. Sleep well.

51
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm going now.

52
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,370
President Shin's phone is turned off.
Is something wrong?

53
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,200
He's home now.

54
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,060
He came home half-dead this morning
and fell asleep on the sofa.

55
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,240
I asked him what was wrong,
but he wouldn't say a word.

56
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,390
He's not the type to act like this unless
something is really wrong.

57
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,650
This is bad timing.
We have to prepare for "Legend Again".

58
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,460
Can I go over there and check on him?

59
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,600
Let's leave him alone for today.

60
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,020
It must be something
he can't talk to us about.

61
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,420
Gosh, he's still lying there like that.

62
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,390
Suk Ho, what's wrong with you?

63
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,840
You didn't eat anything all day, did you?

64
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,420
Seriously, get up and talk to me.

65
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,270
Yes, finally!

66
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,110
The arrangement is finished.

67
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,010
We can practice it
in the studio tomorrow.

68
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,130
Wow!

69
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,640
Why don't we show it to President Shin
and start practicing?

70
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,850
Geu Rin?

71
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,210
What? Me?

72
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,200
What is it? Are you sick?

73
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,450
No, I'm not sick.

74
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,400
I said that the new arrangement
is complete.

75
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,920
Can we start practicing tomorrow,
Manager?

76
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,090
President Shin is a bit sick.

77
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,320
He's been in bed all day.

78
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,750
The President is ill?

79
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,810
What about the hospital?

80
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,820
I was going to visit him today,
but we thought he should just rest.

81
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,070
It's a big problem if our leader is sick.

82
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:35,860
I'll go out and buy some porridge.

83
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,290
The water is over there. Give him some.

84
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,310
Okay.

85
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,300
President. It's me, Geu Rin.

86
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,150
Are you very sick?

87
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,690
What is this?
Our leader can't be like this.

88
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,260
I'll go get you some water.
Drink some water.

89
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,390
Yes?

90
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,780
How is the President?

91
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,300
I don't know. He's still sleeping.

92
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,960
He won't drink water or eat anything.
He's just sleeping.

93
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,020
That's worrisome.

94
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,790
What about you, Sis?
Have you eaten anything?

95
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,140
Yes, I ate with Man Shik.

96
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,160
Did you really?

97
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,910
I did. What about you?

98
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,170
We always eat just fine.

99
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,460
Let's practice Kyle's
new arrangement tomorrow.

100
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,580
We can't just sit around like this.

101
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,620
Okay, I'll let the others know.

102
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,470
I'm asking you as a favor.

103
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,060
Make sure you eat all your meals, Sis.

104
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,700
Lately, you have been calling me Sister.

105
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,800
Have I?

106
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,170
Why? Should I stop?

107
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,360
No, it reminds me of when we first met.

108
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,880
I really liked it back then.

109
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,320
I had a cute younger brother,
even though you were much taller than me.

110
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,780
I feel the same way now.

111
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,710
I'm really happy to have
a cute younger brother.

112
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,910
Go to bed soon. You look tired.

113
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,070
<i>Yes, you must have been in pain.</i>

114
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,470
<i>Just like my heart that has burned away.</i>

115
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,420
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,980
Hello!

117
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,730
Is President Shin here yet?

118
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,000
Is he coming?

119
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,220
He told us to meet him here.

120
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,750
Hello!

121
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,970
- You're here?
- Yes.

122
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:49,020
Did Suk Ho contact you too?

123
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,410
I see he's not here yet.

124
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,480
Is something going on, President Byun?

125
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,750
Lately, both you
and Suk Ho look really unwell.

126
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,590
Oh, he's here!

127
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,230
Suk Ho.

128
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,990
President.

129
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,810
I've been going through a really
difficult time these past few days.

130
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,130
I'm sorry for making you all worry.

131
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,000
I think it's been over 10 years.

132
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,370
I had a friend that I was very fond of.

133
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,110
He was a great songwriter
and he sang very well too.

134
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:00,320
So, I introduced my friend to an agency.

135
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,670
I thought it was a waste
of his talents to keep them hidden.

136
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,510
He said he didn't want to
and that he couldn't do it.

137
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
I barely managed to convince him.

138
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,650
It was because... my friend
had a physical disability.

139
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,050
I introduced him to my company.

140
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,570
Then I had to go on a one month
business trip to Moscow.

141
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,350
When I returned...

142
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,650
my friend had died.

143
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,340
They said it was a heart attack.

144
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,160
My friend never ended up
releasing his album.

145
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,090
Over 10 years passed.

146
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,350
I ended up meeting his little brother.

147
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
Jo Ha Neul.

148
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,350
My friend, Jo Sung Hyun's
little brother, Jo Ha Neul.

149
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,230
Why are you doing this?

150
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,640
Why are you suddenly telling our story?

151
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:45,200
We should not... go on "Legend Again".

152
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,420
What?

153
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,720
But, I already finished
the arrangement. Why?

154
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,680
It could be a big performance for us.

155
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,470
Why would you want to lose it?

156
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,500
"It's Okay to Cry"...

157
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,910
cannot be sung by Ha Neul.

158
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,400
President Byun, do you know
anything about this?

159
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,940
That song...

160
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,780
That's enough.

161
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,700
I will...

162
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,800
I will explain.

163
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,660
Choi Joon Ha's second album.

164
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,880
It was released from KTOP
when Suk Ho and I were there.

165
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,090
Sung Hyun...

166
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,880
His songs were really great.

167
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,360
That's why they remain classics.

168
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,350
Didn't you say he never
released an album?

169
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,080
What are you saying?

170
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,680
Choi Joon Ha's "It's Okay to Cry" is...

171
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,190
It's Sung Hyun's song.

172
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,090
"It's Okay to Cry" is not
Choi Joon Ha's song.

173
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,950
It belongs to your brother.

174
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,800
It's Jo Sung Hyun's song.

175
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,330
Wait a minute.

176
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,330
So... was my brother's song stolen?

177
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,510
Is that what happened?

178
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,990
- One more thing...
- Suk Ho!

179
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,200
He should know.

180
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,160
He deserves to know
about his only family.

181
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,000
What is it?

182
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,590
What more could there be?

183
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,810
Sung Hyun...

184
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,660
It wasn't a heart attack.

185
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,420
Because of that incident...

186
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,770
he drowned himself in the Han River.

187
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,880
That's why...

188
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,900
That is why...

189
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,700
I think we should...

190
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,780
forget about doing "Legend Again".

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,470
Hey, Suk Ho!

193
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,210
- President!
- Suk Ho!

194
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,850
Hey, Suk Ho!

195
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,150
Hey, wake up! Suk Ho!

196
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,080
Aren't you feeling cooped up in here?
Want to go for a drive?

197
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,560
Suk Ho must be
going through a tough time.

198
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,910
I know I shouldn't be...

199
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,630
But, I keep thinking "what if"...

200
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,320
Way back, long ago...

201
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,930
What if Suk Ho had never
been in my brother's life?

202
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,680
Would my family
still be alive and together?

203
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:04,020
My brother would be alive.
My mom and dad too.

204
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,530
You would be there, as well.

205
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,000
Would we all be leading normal lives?

206
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,720
Yeah.

207
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,990
I suppose your parents wouldn't have
been opposed to you singing either.

208
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,550
They wouldn't have gotten into
an accident to come and stop you.

209
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,370
I keep having those thoughts.

210
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,960
I want to turn back time.

211
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,220
You know what, Ha Neul?

212
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,530
When you and I were struggling,
and you were framed...

213
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:53,910
When you gave up on music
and you were having a hard time...

214
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,740
<i>What if he hadn't come into our lives?</i>

215
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,890
<i>You would still be framed for that crime
and you wouldn't be singing.</i>

216
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,410
<i>Don't you think
that's how we'd be living?</i>

217
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,610
<i>Do you think I can face Suk Ho again?</i>

218
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,120
<i>When I see Suk Ho's face,
I'll only think of my brother.</i>

219
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,250
<i>Do you think I'll be able to bear it?</i>

220
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,360
Ha Neul, I know both you and the
President are going through a tough time.

221
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,760
What about my brother?

222
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,050
He had no one by his side.

223
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,890
<i>He was all alone...</i>

224
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,530
<i>in that cold place.</i>

225
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,220
<i>He left in such a lonely
and miserable way.</i>

226
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,730
<i>Suk Ho and I are still here.</i>

227
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,150
<i>My brother... is gone.</i>

228

<i>[ENTERTAINER BAND]</i>

229
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,610
I thought about it on my way here.

230
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,620
I wish we hadn't had
such a big age gap between us.

231
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,850
It would have been better that way.

232
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:18,750
Then you could have
come to me for advice.

233
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,130
You wouldn't have been so lonely...

234
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,830
and died like that.

235
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,050
Sung Hyun.

236
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,280
This relationship with Shin Suk Ho...

237
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
I don't like it.

240
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,990
Sung Hyun!

241
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,060
Sung Hyun.

242
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,700
Should we go home now?

243
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,280
Or should we go get some food?

244
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,410
I think I should see him.

245
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,140
Lee Joon Suk.

246
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,720
You're not saying
we should go to KTOP, are you?

247
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,920
- Ha Neul, why don't you wait...
- I have to see him.

248
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,880
I'll be back. It won't take long.

249
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,490
Let's go together.

250
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,080
He's not someone I will take long with.

251
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,940
I'll be back soon.

Yes, I suppose you need
to shout once too.

254
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,760
This is the first time we've met,
isn't it?

255
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,160
How should I greet you?

256
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,670
You will find it awkward
to hear anything I have to say.

257
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't want to hear a thing.

258
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,110
I don't want to hear a sound
out of trash like you.

259
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,310
My older brother, Jo Sung Hyun...

260
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,900
He died because of you.

261
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,030
You're too worthless to even hear about
the pain my family went through.

262
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,270
I have only one thing to say.

263
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,130
I assume Suk Ho did that to your face.

264
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,170
But, I'm going to kill you silently,
Lee Joon Suk.

265
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:33,700
No, I will make you want to die.

266
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,290
Just like you did...

267
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,990
to my brother.

268
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,290
I'm not only worried about Ha Neul
and "It's Okay to Cry".

269
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,450
I'm worried that he may not
ever want to sing again.

270
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:19,000
He just found out about what happened
to a family member that he loved.

271
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,630
Do you think he can get over it?

272
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,670
Ha Neul must feel like
his heart is going to implode.

273
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,170
Kyle, what are you doing?
Why are you ripping up the sheet music?

274
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,380
Kyle!

275
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,650
We don't need this.

276
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,200
How can Ha Neul sing this song?

277
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,260
Could you or Yeon Soo
stand to see that happen?

278
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,370
The President is right about this.

279
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,990
Let's not go on "Legend Again".

280
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,770
You're right.

281
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,980
Ha Neul must feel like he's going crazy.

282
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,730
Let's not do it.
There will be other performances.

283
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm going to sing it.

284
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,400
Don't do it. How can you sing that?

285
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,540
Your brother is a brother to us too.

286
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,510
Are we insane?

287
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,170
Your brother wrote that song.

288
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,520
Someone claimed it as his, got a big hit,
and is living well somewhere.

289
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,290
Are we crazy? How could we sing that?

290
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,860
I can't do it. I can't play that.

291
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,570
- No, I'm going to sing it.
- Ha Neul...

292
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,060
Don't tell me that I can't
or that I should wait!

293
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,190
No... sing it if you want to.

294
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,520
Geu Rin, this decision
should be made by...

295
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,600
Yeon Soo, I don't think the President's
decision is important this time.

296
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,500
Ha Neul's decision is what's important.

297
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,520
I'll make arrangements with the station
in place of President Shin.

298
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,110
Let's show everyone and sing it well.

299
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,680
If you want to sing Sung Hyun's song,
you should sing it.

300
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,620
No matter what anyone says,
it Sung Hyun's song.

301
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,700
I'm going to go see the President.

302
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,830
- I'll drive you.
- I want to go alone.

303
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,130
Where is he?

304
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,740
Oh, he said he wanted to eat caramels.

305
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,860
I went to the store and he disappeared.

306
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,470
It's already night.
Why did he turn his phone off?

307
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,830
I stepped out to get him some clothes.
How could you lose him?

308
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,910
President Byun, my brother...

309
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,520
Which bridge was Sung Hyun
standing on before he jumped?

310
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,420
You should just wait for me
to come back before recording.

311
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,970
You think I'll release an album
just because I record?

312
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:38,170
President Byun and Chairman Lee Joon Suk
are all good people.

313
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,620
You don't need to worry.
Just show them how talented you are.

314
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,380
Honestly, people will faint
if you show them half of your talents.

315
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,190
Gosh, do all managers exaggerate
and lie as much as you?

316
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,460
What?

317
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,180
I guess you have to make
your actors and singers stand out.

318
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,250
You must've been so cold.

319
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,100
You must've been so lonely
here by yourself.

320
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,650
I'm here too late, Sung Hyun.

321
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,670
What are you planning to do?

322
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,230
You'll die if you fall from here.

323
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,020
Are you going to die?

324
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,830
Are you going to follow Sung Hyun?

325
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,750
Am I being left behind
while everyone leaves again?

326
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,260
Even breathing...

327
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,590
Even breathing...

328
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,620
makes my heart hurt so much.

329
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,040
Jo Sung Hyun!

330
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,280
Sung Hyun!

331
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,780
Suk Ho! Where were you?

332
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,310
I went for a walk.

333
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,120
We thought something happened to you.
Min Joo and I were so scared.

334
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,600
I remember it all.

335
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:11,690
My brother wouldn't go
on outings with us.

336
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,710
My family never even went
out to eat at a proper restaurant.

337
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,620
Sung Hyun was uncomfortable
being around other people.

338
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,170
But... things changed
when he met a friend named Shin Suk Ho.

339
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,520
<i>When he had a day off...</i>

340
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,810
<i>other managers would all be resting.</i>

341
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:42,280
<i>His friend Shin Suk Ho would come over
and take my brother out.</i>

342
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,600
Cheers!

343
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,630
Cheers!

344
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,830
<i>I thought that was the end
of our relationship.</i>

345
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,090
Even though my brother was gone,
he came and found me.

346
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,400
Shin Suk Ho, my brother's
one and only friend.

347
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,500
And... he grabbed my hand.

348
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,880
He helped me sing again.

349
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:31,410
He cleared my name
and proved I was innocent.

350
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,770
Suk Ho, let's stop trying
to console each other.

351
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,160
Let's stop talking about painful things.

352
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,890
Geu Rin is right.

353
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:52,640
I thought about, what if you
had never met my brother...

354
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,470
What if...

355
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,710
you hadn't shown up in my life
after all those years?

356
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,730
What do you think would've happened?

357
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,800
I know it may take time.

358
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,200
Let's not talk about "what if".

359
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,270
I won't do it either.

360
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,510
Yeah, Suk Ho. Be strong.

361
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,880
The members of Entertainer Band
have come to a decision.

362
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,900
We...

363
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,200
are going to perform on "Legend Again".

366
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,510
I'm going to sing my brother's song.

367
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,050
That's what we have decided,
so you need to get up now, Suk Ho.

368
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,730
Get back up.

369
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,590
My brother's song...

370
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,000
I want you to get it back.

371
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:50,030
I will die someday, right?

372
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,970
The one thing I have to do
before dying is this.

373
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,400
I have to reclaim Sung Hyun's song.

374
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,210
I'll help you however I can.

375
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,010
Have you thought about
how you're going to do it?

376
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,380
There is only one way.

377
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:10,670
Choi Joon Ha.

378
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:15,850
We need to find him before the show airs
and get him to admit the truth.

379
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,520
Do you think we can find him?

380
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,200
I went to a meeting at the TV station
and they've been looking for him too.

381
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,440
They wanted him to come on the show.

382
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,850
But, he's been hiding since the incident.

383
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,840
Which singer was the closest
to Choi Joon Ha?

384
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,770
Yeon Kyung spoke of Choi Joon Ha often.

385
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,040
Do you think they're still in touch?

386
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,170
So many people are looking for
Choi Joon Ha lately.

387
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:46,510
The TV station came looking for him.

388
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:50,170
I haven't seen Joon Ha in a long time.

389
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:52,150
He's no longer in Korea.

390
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,260
I think it was about five years ago,
we had coffee.

391
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,640
His father was sick
and he lived in a home.

392
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,590
I don't know how he is now.

393
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,890
So, I think he comes in
once a year to see his father.

394
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,750
Do you know where that home is?

395
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,960
I don't know.

396
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,620
Oh, but he did say he was on his way
back from visiting his father.

397
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,450
He was coming from Yeongwol.

398
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,550
Yeongwol.

399
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,760
<i>[YEONGWOL SENIOR HOME]</i>

400
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,300
Hello.

401
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,710
I'm looking for a patient
with the last name Choi.

402
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,220
I'm looking for one of my father's
friends. I owe him a big favor.

403
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,740
I'm not too certain of his name.

404
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,120
- The last name is Choi?
- Yes.

405
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,170
One moment.

406
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,630
Is it Choi Jin Goo, by any chance?

407
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,610
Is his son's name Choi Joon Ha?

408
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,660
I really need to find him,
so please help me out.

409
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:07,100
You won't be able to converse with him.

410
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,750
His Alzheimer's is very severe.

411
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,310
He can't even recognize his son
when he visits from Australia.

412
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,430
Australia?

413
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,600
Uh, Kyle...

414
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm sorry, but can we try
a different arrangement?

415
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,120
Why? Are you not feeling it?

416
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,250
No, it's not that.

417
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,090
Hey, is this...

418
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:10,870
Yes.

419
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,680
It's the first version
that my brother wrote.

420
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,720
The original is a real work of art.

421
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,850
This isn't a different arrangement.

422
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,080
Let's go with the original song.

423
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,640
Thanks.

424
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,310
Sorry guys. We'll have to practice again.

425
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,890
It's fine with us.

426
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,250
What an honor.

427
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,750
We're going to play the song
using the original sheet music.

428
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,000
Kyle, what should I do? I'm nervous.

429
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,490
You're nervous?

430
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,660
Let's give the original a try.

431
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,890
Why are you calling me?

432
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,940
How have you been?

433
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,310
I'm just living.

434
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,920
Are you working with Lee Joon Suk again?

435
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Yes.

436
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,200
Joo Han, after everything
he did to you...

437
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,150
I have to make sure
I screw him over before I leave.

438
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,790
You're looking for
Choi Joon Ha, aren't you?

439
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,980
Did Lee Joon Suk tell you
to look for Choi Joon Ha?

440
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,020
Yes.

441
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,390
Are you planning on going to Australia?

442
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:42,880
You're pretty quick, Kim Joo Han.

443
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,470
I am quicker than you think, Suk Ho.

444
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,150
Choi Joon Ha isn't in Australia.
I already went there.

445
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,410
I met his family and asked around.
He's in Korea.

446
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,440
Choi Joon Ha is here right now.

447
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,330
Why are you telling me this?

448
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:10,950
Why don't you just hit me
a few times and let's end this.

449
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,540
I betrayed you and bothered you
because I was obsessed with success.

450
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,580
I didn't care about loyalty and all that.

451
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,340
Just beat me up.

452
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,290
I'll take it as long as I don't die.

453
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,360
Do I have the right to do that?

454
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,710
I was the same kind of person.

455
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,940
I'm telling you before
I tell Lee Joon Suk because...

456
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,310
I want to repay my debt
to Jo Ha Neul a little bit.

457
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,960
Though I know I won't ever
be able to repay it all.

458
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:46,050
In Korea?

459
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:48,070
Look through all these hotels.

460
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,470
Choi Joon Ha could be
staying in one of them.

461
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,060
Let's split up and wait
in the lobby of each hotel.

462
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,990
Don't you think he'd come out
once a day, at least?

463
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,160
I'll head over to the senior home.
I don't think he's seen his father yet.

464
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,440
We don't know how long it'll take.
You just want to wait at the hotels?

465
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,570
We have no other way.

466
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,470
Yeah, hotels are so secretive.

467
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,690
They won't give out information
on their guests easily.

468
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:17,500
Which hotel should I go to first?
I should find pictures of Choi Joon Ha.

469
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,410
I don't want to miss him.

470
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,550
The anniversary of your death
is approaching again.

471
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,040
I come here every year
on the anniversary of your death.

472
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:56,490
I tell myself this is the last time
and return home.

473
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,320
But...

474
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,540
Every year, here I am again.

475
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,630
Don't you feel cooped up in there?

476
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:16,030
The land spacious and
the air is good in Australia.

477
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,510
Yet, I feel so suffocated.

478
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,920
No matter where I go in this world...

479
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,310
I'm in a prison.

00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,260
I don't think this is the place either.
I was there all night.

482
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,000
I thought maybe he was going through
the parking lot, so I tried the elevator.

483
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,520
But, I looked suspicious on the CCTV
and they kicked me out.

484
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,640
Gosh, I'm really starting to feel my age.

485
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,160
My joints hurt so much.

486
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,900
Splitting up like this won't work.

487
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,740
There are too many hotels.

488
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,360
I think I'll head to the senior home.

489
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,160
President Shin is alone and probably
hasn't even been able to shower.

490
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,870
Geu Rin, you're not feeling well. How
can you go that far at this late hour?

491
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,380
Every person here
is worried about Suk Ho.

492
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,110
We've all been with him a long time
and care about him deeply.

493
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,670
I don't think it's right to go all the
way to Yeongwol at this hour, Geu Rin.

494
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,790
Last time, you asked to borrow money.

495
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:05,370
Then ended up in some
weird pictures and came to explain.

496
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,770
Today, you want what?

497
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,980
You want me to play golf
with the chairman of every hotel?

498
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,110
My back hurts so I can't.

499
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,480
Then you can all get together
and you can buy them drinks.

500
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,220
Why would I do that?

501
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:25,950
Just help me out once.
I'll be a little bit obedient.

502
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:29,370
Not very obedient, but a little bit?

503
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:33,720
What kind of a deal is that?
Forget it. Forget it.

504
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:38,360
Okay, I'll be very good.
I'll come home two times a month.

505
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,990
How is that? Good, right?

506
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,350
You have to go on a marriage date too.

507
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:44,590
That's a no.

508
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,790
Forget it then.

509
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,390
Okay, I'll go once.

510
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,910
So, who are you looking for again?

511
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:57,450
Choi Joon Ha. He's a famous singer.

512
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,330
People in the hotel industry
will know him.

513
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,780
It's been a long time, Joon Ha.

514

Choi Joon Ha as well.</i>

517
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,700
<i>He used all his hotel connections.</i>

518
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:27,710
Jo Sung Hyun's little brother?

519
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,830
Didn't you hear from the TV station?

520
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:34,660
A junior singer will do a remake
of your song "It's Okay to Cry".

00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,660
Isn't the world a funny place?

523
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,170
Because of this show,
he found out what happened.

524
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:53,120
Do you remember Shin Suk Ho?
He was just a manager at our company.

525
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,310
Oh, Jo Sung Hyun's friend.

526
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:58,090
He introduced Jo Sung Hyun to me.

527
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:02,360
You wouldn't know his face
since you never met.

528
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,480
He's the President
of Jo Ha Neul's band's agency.

529
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:08,180
He's looking for you like a mad man.

530
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,920
The reason I looked for you...

531
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,940
is so you can continue
living like you are now.

532
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,780
Your kids must have grown a lot.

533
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,350
You shouldn't become
a shameful father to your children.

534
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,670
Don't show up now and let your
guilty conscious get the best of you.

535
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,080
The consequences will be very big.

536
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,410
Once Shin Suk Ho
reveals everything, that is.

537
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,680
The burden of those consequences
will be entirely on your shoulders.

538
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,420
Aren't you afraid?

539
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,440
Everyone is this country
will point their fingers at you.

540
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:49,300
You stole the song of a man
who was physically disabled.

541
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,970
Would you ever be able
to hold your head up again?

542
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,940
Don't delay any longer
and risk getting caught by him.

543
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:58,920
Why don't you leave today if you can?

544
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,160
I'm here to see Choi Joon Ha.
He's in room 2004.

545
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,920
Please call him for me
and tell him I'll be waiting here.

546
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,150
The guest in room 2004 checked out.

547
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:24,820
What? When?

548
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,990
He just checked out.
I'll confirm for you.

549
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,440
Yes, okay.

550
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,600
They're cleaning the room now.
He has already left.

551
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,580
Could I possibly get his contact info?

552
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,370
Please, I'm asking you.

553
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,760
I can't give out guest information.

554
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:56,970
I can leave a message for him
if you leave me your contact info.

555
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:59,130
He left an item in the room safe.

556
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,080
If he contacts the hotel to look for it,
I will give him your message.

557
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:07,010
Oh, then can I please have
a piece of paper?

558
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,520
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

559
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,640
<i>Cheers.</i>

560
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,860
Suk Ho, they say
it's really cold in Moscow.

561
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,020
You need to keep it together
and don't freeze over there.

562
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,700
<i>Hello, I am Jo Sung Hyun's friend,
Shin Suk Ho.</i>

563
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,200
<i>I would really like to meet you
and that's why I'm leaving this note.</i>

564
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,210
<i>I know why you could not sing
the song you liked for so long.</i>

565
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,740
<i>I understand why
you have been hiding all this time.</i>

566
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,220
<i>I do not resent you.</i>

567
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,600
<i>I have no right to resent you.</i>

568
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,870
<i>I have wronged another the same way.</i>

569
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:23,740
<i>I used money and power to steal a song
from a nameless songwriter.</i>

570
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,150
<i>And I convinced a famous group
to release it as their own.</i>

571
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
<i>On the day that album was released...</i>

572
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:33,080
<i>that poor, nameless songwriter
left this world.</i>

573
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:34,840
<i>Because of me.</i>

574
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,100
I haven't seen you in a long time,
and you're not drinking.

575
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,590
Have you stopped drinking?

576
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,570
I'm waiting for someone.

577
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,210
Oh...

578
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,260
<i>How could I resent you?</i>

579
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,770
<i>I would like to meet with you just once.</i>

580
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,420
<i>The anniversary of Sung Hyun's death
is in two days.</i>

581
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:05,090
<i>I will wait for you at
the shabby bar we used to go to.</i>

582
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,140
<i>It's a hole in the wall
in Jinhae Market in Suncheon.</i>

583
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,310
<i>Let's share a soju
on the anniversary of his death.</i>

584
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,180
<i>I will wait until you come.</i>

585
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,170
<i>Please, I'm asking you to come.</i>

586
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,560
Come again, next time.
I'll give you some delicious free snacks.

587
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,730
I have to get going now.

588
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:41,150
Oh, do you?

589
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm sorry.

590
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:58,540
How much is it?
