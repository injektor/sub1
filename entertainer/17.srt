00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,770
Sign here, Suk Ho.

5
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm old enough
to be your uncle, you know.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,830
Okay, Jo Ha Neul.

00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,290
<i>[CONTACT: THE PRESIDENT WILL CREATE A BAND FOR ME...]</i>

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,450
Shin Suk Ho.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,470
Here is the contract.

10
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,500
I will do my best to make
your brother into a singer.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,970
Oh, thank you very much.

12
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,980
He hasn't graduated elementary school
yet, so his future looks bleak.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,050
Sung Hyun.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,280
It took me too long
to keep my promise, right?

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,810
Now, it's my turn.

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,750
I will return the song that I stole.

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,470
I was waiting here
to take you to the airport.

18
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,560
I will drive you there.

19
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,800
I called a taxi. It's all right.

20
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,320
I should have call you earlier.

21
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,630
I guess I was too late.

22
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,160
We should say our goodbyes here.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,420
Thanks to you, President Shin...

24
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,200
I've had this lump in my chest for
10 years and it's finally gone.

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,950
I'll do the rest myself.

26
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,910
Thank you for taking the first big step.

27
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,020
I've learned a lot from you.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,940
I think it's my turn now.

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,110
Well, the taxi is waiting.

30
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,320
Call me if you ever visit Australia.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,590
Drinks are on me.

32
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,780
I'll do that.

33
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,330
I don't think I'll forget today
for a really, really long time.

34
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,070
Ha Neul was really great today!

35
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,500
Suk Ho... President Shin worked so hard.

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,660
Thank you to everyone.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,030
I had trouble holding back tears
while I was playing.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,780
Where is President Shin anyway?

39
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,580
Is he somewhere crying by himself?

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,430
He went to say goodbye to Choi Joon Ha.

41
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,630
I enjoyed the performance.

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,780
It was really good.

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,220
Yeah, it was.

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,020
You act like you're talking about
another group.

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,540
Why did you ask to see me?

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,830
Oh, I'm looking into details
for you to study abroad.

47
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,420
Before I leave...

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,000
I want to return it too.

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,550
After seeing you and Choi Joon Ha...

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
I thought about
how I should live my life.

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
I got some courage.

52
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,600
As you suggested...

53
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,340
I want to give back "Don't Touch".

54
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,050
You might not be able
to go on stage again.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,840
Either way, it will be hard
for me to go onstage again.

56
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,450
I feel too guilty.

57
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,600
It will be a bigger problem for you.

58
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,560
I looked into it.

59
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,550
We could both end up in jail.

60
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,590
What about Entertainer Band?

61
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,650
I don't know.

62
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,830
What should I do?

63
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,180
President Shin, are you
sick or something?

64
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,110
Did you get some sort of bad diagnosis?

65
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,180
I have lost some weight lately,
but I have no health issues.

66
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,930
Then why would you propose such a thing?

67
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,280
I am joking, of course.

68
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,660
But, why would you do this unless
you have a limited time to live?

69
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,540
Entertainer Band is done suffering
and is finally on their way to success.

70
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,330
Why would you throw that away?

71
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,880
How am I throwing that away?

72
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,080
I just want them to grow bigger
in a proper system.

73
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,650
Mango could join Wild Company.

74
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,440
However...

75
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,780
I may be away
for an extended time period.

76
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,000
Gosh, you sure are saying
some strange things today.

77
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,200
<i>What? You turned yourself in?</i>

78
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,080
Why didn't you consult me first?

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,950
What were you thinking!

80
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,340
If I had consulted you?

81
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,060
"Yes, turn yourself in."

82
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,330
Would you have said that?

83
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,340
What about the investigation?
How will it proceed?

84
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,970
Once they contact songwriter
Jang Min Soo's family

85
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,550
they will call me in again.

86
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,550
They can't get in touch
with his younger brother.

87
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,860
I guess my confession isn't enough.

88
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,100
And once they confirm everything?

89
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,010
Will you go to jail?

90
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,750
Maximum of one year in jail
or a fine of 10 million won.

91
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,070
Let's pay the fine.
We can get the 10 million won somehow.

92
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,300
Don't do that. I won't pay it.

93
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,360
Even if the money fell
from the sky, I wouldn't pay it.

94
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,890
I'm going to jail.

95
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,620
Is jail a game to you?

96
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,360
Min Joo.

97
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,450
How can 10 million won
make up for someone's life?

98
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,480
Even being in jail for a year is not
enough to make up for a life.

99
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,820
If they want to punish me more severely,
I'm willing to accept it.

100
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,390
Also, our Entertainer Band...

101
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,400
I've made arrangements for them
to join Wild Company.

102
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,220
I know you and Geu Rin could handle it.

103
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,410
But, I think it's best to send
the kids to a bigger company.

104
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,800
You should worry about yourself
before you worry about the kids.

105
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,180
What will you do for a living
once you get out of jail?

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,550
You have to keep Mango going.
How can you close it down?

107
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,790
I don't have the confidence to do it.

108
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,090
Sung Hyun, what did you think
of our performance?

109
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,500
I will be singing until I die.

110
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,420
But, I don't think anything
will top singing with you.

111
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,770
President wants to go
out for lunch. Let's go.

112
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,720
- Okay, be right there.
- Okay.

113
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,910
Oh, this is good.

114
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,970
I think it's even better
because it's been so long.

115
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,930
Oh, by the way.

116
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,410
Have you guys heard of a big company
called Wild Company?

117
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,670
It's a really big management company.

118
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,380
They have a lot of singers
and actors too.

119
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,240
Why are you bringing up that company?

120
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,440
I think Entertainer Band
needs to move on to stage two.

121
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,500
I had a meeting with them and
they are very interested in us.

122
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,710
So, Entertainer Band
will no longer be Mango.

123
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,430
We will be part of Wild Company
and work with Wild.

124
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,180
You'll get into Japan, China,
Southeast Asia, and the Hallyu craze.

125
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,810
I like things the way they are now.

126
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,930
We can work hard and make ourselves
into that kind of company.

127
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,210
Yeah, let's eat lots and work harder!

128
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,160
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

129
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,750
No, you guys don't understand.

130
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,640
Mango is like a small, tiny store.

131
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,030
Most companies have about a hundred
employees overseeing one new group.

132
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,780
We're happy with the way things are.

133
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,740
Just keep an open mind and
think about this realistically.

134
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,240
Wild Company has a person in charge

135
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,530
of music, drama,
commercials, international...

136
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,070
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

137
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,170
I...

138
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,830
I...

139
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,190
I don't have the right to be President of
the agency representing Entertainer Band.

140
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,420
We made a promise as a joke 11 years ago.

141
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,340
You did everything you could
to get me on that stage.

142
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,910
Yet, you say you don't have the right?

143
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
Then what would give you the right?

144
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,860
I don't know.

145
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,830
Both Lee Joon Suk and I are the same.

146
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,560
Why would you say something like that?

147
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,620
How are you anything like him?

148
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,960
Well, the thing is...

149
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,920
I've been doing this job a long time.

150
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,530
And no matter how drunk I got, I called
a designated driver or took a taxi.

151
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,300
I never drove myself.

152
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,440
President, why are you suddenly
talking about your drunk driving?

153
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,360
But, that night...

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,800
The reason I drove was...

155
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,070
That night...

156
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,670
an unknown songwriter
had committed suicide.

157
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,390
Jackson's "Don't Touch".

158
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,700
Jin Woo didn't write it.
It was written by that songwriter.

159
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,140
I stole that song from him.

160
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,340
He was a poor songwriter
who begged and pleaded with me.

161
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,870
I said cruel things to him.

162
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,470
That day he committed suicide.

163
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,190
I suddenly felt the need for speed.

164
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,530
I grabbed the steering wheel
and got into an accident.

165
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:19,060
I went to jail.

166
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,080
I couldn't protect Jackson.

167
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,650
Why would someone like me have any right?

168
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,190
How can I continue working
with nice kids like you?

169
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,720
I turned myself in.

170
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,610
Once the investigation starts,
I think I'll probably go to jail.

171
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,080
The police are tracking down
the family of that songwriter.

172
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,060
Once they find them,
the investigation will proceed.

173
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,220
I can't stay here with all of you.

174
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,440
So, go to a better company.

175
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,870
Work hard and make Entertainer Band
flourish even more.

176
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,230
Here's the pizza that you ordered.

177
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,490
Thank you.

178
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,730
Yeon Soo, give this to Chan Hee.

179
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,750
Chan Hee should be home
from kindergarten soon.

180
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,040
Let's get going now.

181
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,030
What are you all doing? Get up.

182
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,040
What's with the expression on your faces?

183
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,220
It's not like I'm immigrating.

184
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,870
You have to go
make money at a big company

185
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,330
so that you can give me
an allowance later.

186
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,930
Let's go.

187
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,820
He was killed because of
a low-life in this industry.

188
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,990
It happened while I
was driving to his funeral.

189
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,170
That must have been why he worked
so hard to get Sung Hyun's song back.

190
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,620
What do you think the President
was like in the past?

191
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,250
He's a really good person now.

192
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,900
I was about to give up on drumming
because of my mom.

193
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,250
If weren't for President Shin,
I wouldn't have had the courage.

194
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,610
I would still be working
in those karaoke club bands.

195
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,190
Honestly, who doesn't have
skeletons in their closet?

196
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,780
On the other hand...

197
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,480
that songwriter's family
probably went through a hard time

198
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,190
like Ha Neul's family.

199
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,220
You're very tired, right?

200
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,280
I can look at these alone.

201
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,880
Suk Ho.

202
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,440
I always thought I knew you better
than anyone except for your parents.

203
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,200
You probably do.

204
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,400
Seeing how much you're changing lately,
I don't think it's true though.

205
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,090
What do you mean, I'm changing?

206
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:43,310
I'm barely getting by trying to fix
the stupid mistakes that I made.

207
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,920
Yes, this is Shin Suk Ho.

208
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,970
Yes... yes.

209
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,360
All right.

210
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,150
I'll be right there.

211
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,680
What is it?

212
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,160
They got in touch
with the songwriter's family.

213
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,160
I'll be going now.

214
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,310
I'll go with you.

215
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,730
You'll just go and cry.

216
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,080
It's okay.

217
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,340
I'll go alone.
I need to organize my thoughts too.

218
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,270
Take care of the kids and make sure
they aren't too traumatized.

219
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,630
Oh, you're here. Sit down.

220
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,780
You're Jang Jin Soo, the younger brother
of Jang Min Soo, right?

221
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,920
Yes.

222
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,440
Shin Suk Ho has turned himself in
for misappropriation of copyright.

223
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,350
We need to confirm the facts.

224
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,310
Shin Suk Ho stole a song
that Jang Min Soo wrote.

225
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,130
Then, Jang Min Soo committed suicide.

226
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,250
Is that right?

227
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,800
I'm not sure.

228
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,470
Well, you need to let us know accurately.

229
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know anything accurately.

230
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,730
Excuse me, what are you saying?

231
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,540
You came to my office last year.

232
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,260
It's true that my brother passed away.

233
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,930
As for the reason...

234
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,090
I have no way of knowing why.

235
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,890
There was no suicide letter.

236
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm busy trying to make a living.

237
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,140
Why are you calling me here
for something so unpleasant?

238
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,420
But, you came to me with that song.

239
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,220
You asked me why I killed your brother.

240
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,310
You came to my office.

241
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,750
Don't call me again
about such a painful family memory.

242
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,150
I only came because
I was told I needed to.

243
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,900
I lose a day's pay by coming here.

244
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,350
It's hard enough to make a living,
so don't call me here again.

245
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,600
So, you're not going to press charges?

246
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,970
If so...

247
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,830
There's nothing to press charges for.

248
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,720
This person?

249
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,680
I don't know him.

250
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,790
What is all this?

251
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,050
Wait, hold on.

252
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,250
You don't know me? You do know who I am.

253
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,770
You know what I did to your brother.

254
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,810
Do you want to go to jail that badly?

255
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,170
I don't want to go.

256
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,600
Why would you get punished? I will.

257
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,630
I came here all the way from Sokcho.

258
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,380
I won't even be able
to head back tonight.

259
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,700
Just buy me a drink.

260
00:20:39,724 --> 00:20:51,724

261
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,760
I...

262
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,150
I am the one who killed your brother,
Jang Min Soo.

263
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,760
I even turned myself in.
Why are you claiming not to know me?

264
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,970
You came to me
with the song "Don't Touch".

265
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,890
You know everything,
so why are you doing this?

266
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,890
You've done something wrong.
Now, live with it.

267
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,210
As for the wrong I've done,
I'll have to live with that.

268
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,780
That song was his life.

269
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,040
I stole something he had put all his hope
into and pushed him into the afterlife.

270
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,510
I'm not someone you'd want
to sit and drink soju with.

271
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,860
He couldn't even support
his son's talents.

272
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,620
My father was so poor that he couldn't
buy us rice and we were malnourished.

273
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,880
That pushed my brother.

274
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,320
She said a man
who writes music has no future.

275
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,150
Then she dumped him.

276
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,710
She pushed him once too.

277
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,270
No, that's not it.

278
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,220
He told me he was getting married
after that song was released.

279
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,220
That was what my brother wished for.

280
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,800
It had been over a year
since she had broken up with him.

281
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,380
On the day that my brother died...

282
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,920
he told me was having a hard time
and was just so lonely.

283
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,670
He pleaded with me to come up here
and have a drink with him.

284
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,940
I told him it was hard enough
to make a living with my pay.

285
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,190
I said I would see him next time.

286
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,070
I pushed him once too.

287
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,880
He was standing on the edge.

288
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,550
You pushed him once too.

289
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,660
So, who should be punished first?

290
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,930
This doesn't change anything.

291
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,300
Why don't you get up if you're done here?

292
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,300
Let's go back to the police station
and tell them the truth.

293
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,790
Tell them that I was the one
who made Jang Min Soo commit...

294
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,170
Stop it!

295
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,080
After my brother left like that,
my father hasn't been able to get up.

296
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,390
He's finally getting up
and trying to live.

297
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,670
I can't have my brother's case
come up again.

298
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,770
My father won't be able to get up again.

299
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,340
Why is everyone so selfish?

300
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:31,270
Do you think it would make me
feel better if you go rot in jail?

301
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,150
Would my father feel better?

302
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
Just so you can feel better?

303
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,700
We've only just managed to start healing!

304
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,720
Why are you digging this up now?

305
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,540
Then what should I do?

306
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,840
I can't bring your brother back.

307
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,060
I just want to return the song to him.

308
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,540
I should be punished.

309
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,330
I should spend the rest of my life
in jail if they tell me to.

310
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:09,500
A person is gone.
A person has died and is gone.

311
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,380
Just...

312
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,280
remember it forever and live your life.

313
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,980
As if a thorn has been
pounded into your life.

314
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,980
Live in pain.

315
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,540
That's how I live.

316
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,240
Thanks for the drinks.

317
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,800
Wait!

318
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,860
That performance...

319
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,780
I enjoyed it.

320
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,350
That person who died.

321
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,130
He reminded me of my brother.

322
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,470
I cried a lot.

323
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,420
I enjoyed watching it.

324
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,430
It's hot. Be careful.

325
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,990
I'll call you when Suk Ho comes back.
Why are you here?

326
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,100
I can't do anything else
and I can't sleep.

327
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,940
What about you? Why are you still here?

328
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,100
I don't know.
I guess I feel the same way.

329
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,150
Do you know which police station he's at?

330
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,620
He wanted to go alone.
He didn't tell me anything.

331
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,850
Is that you, Ha Neul?

332
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,600
Where are you? Are you okay?

333
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,240
Our Ha Neul.

334
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,700
My little brother.

335
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,010
Lovable Ha Neul.

336
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,330
Where are you now?
Just wait, I'll be right there.

337
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,090
Ha Neul!

338
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,350
That's enough drinking, Suk Ho.

339
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,700
You're here?

340
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,600
Sit. Sit down.

341
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,200
You drank all of this?

342
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,380
Let's have a drink, Ha Neul.

343
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,930
Ma'am, one bottle of soju please.

344
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,280
It's all right.

345
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,450
Suk Ho, you've had a lot to drink.
Let's get up and go.

346
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,930
- Ha Neul.
- Yes?

347
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,080
You're dying of curiosity, right?

348
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,690
You're wondering why
I'm walking around like this, right?

349
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,770
I ought to be in jail right now,
so why am I walking around drunk?

350
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,650
Tell me tomorrow.

351
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:10,750
I told Man Shik to come to the office.

352
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,870
Why did you call Man Shik?

353
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,680
Let's go for round two.

354
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,110
You can come along with me.

355
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,470
Get on.

356
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,670
Jo Ha Neul, you're pretty strong.

357
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,830
You're strong. Look at this back.

358
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,130
You're heavy. Don't move around.

359
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,450
Ha Neul.

360
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:46,350
Stop talking. You reek of alcohol.

361
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,670
Sung Hyun saved my life.

362
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,730
They don't want to press charges.

363
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,420
He saw you on stage with Sung Hyun.

364
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,780
He liked it.

365
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,960
Sung Hyun.... our Sung Hyun...

366
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,820
He saved me.

367
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,490
Hey, you kept groaning in your sleep.

368
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,540
Did you hurt your back?

369
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,230
No, maybe I slept funny.

370
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,150
I wonder what happened to President Shin.
Is he still at the police station?

371
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,010
He's probably sleeping at home.

372
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,040
Did you hear from him?

373
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,550
He didn't go to jail, did he?

374
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,700
I don't know the details.

375
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,900
He was very drunk last night,
so I took him home.

376
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,500
What? He was drunk?

377
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,600
I've never heard
of President Shin drinking.

378
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,760
- They don't want to press charges.
- What?

379
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,260
Then we won't have to go
to Wild or whatever.

380
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,400
Of course not.

381
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,320
Eat, eat!

382
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:28,344

383
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,860
Ah, I feel like dying.

384
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,750
I really think I'm dying.

385
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,150
How much did you drink?

386
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,130
I haven't gone drinking in so long.
I feel sick.

387
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,980
Who did you drink with?
Is something wrong?

388
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,760
What did the police say?

389
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,500
Police?

390
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,050
- Hello.
- Oh, hi!

391
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,730
President, you feel sick, right?

392
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,160
I knew you would be like this.
This will make you feel better.

393
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,980
I had something. I'll be fine.

394
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,770
Why did you go to the police station?

395
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,270
Ah, later. I'll explain later.

396
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,320
- What about the kids?
- Back at home.

397
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,060
Come to Wild Company at 6:00 p.m.
I'll be there.

398
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,130
President!

399
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,730
I better go to a sauna. Thanks.

400
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,980
Gosh, seriously.

401
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,830
You have to eat something
in order get over a hangover.

402
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,370
I think my hangover is completely gone.

403
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,780
It's hard to say that everything
worked out regarding the stolen songs.

404
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,050
The world is so treacherous.

405
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,380
Everything worked out so why are you
sending the kids to another company?

406
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,120
Our kids would go to waste
if they stayed with me.

407
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,820
There must be some traffic.

408
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,330
There is a lot of traffic
into Gangnam at this hour.

409
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,610
It's all right. I'm sure they'll be here.

410
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,290
I'll call to see where they are.

411
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,310
Where are you?

412
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,940
- We're still at home.
- What?

413
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,780
Why haven't you left yet?

414
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,400
Well... they all refuse to go.

415
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,170
I'm sorry, Chairman.

416
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,890
They must be having
a hard time with this.

417
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,010
They must be very attached to you,
President Shin.

418
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,850
No, it's not like that.

419
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,350
I will arrange another meeting.

420
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,790
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,490
Get everyone to the office right now!

422
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,370
What's with you guys? Huh?

423
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,560
Seriously.

424
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,560
It's hard to get time with Chairman Choi.

425
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,860
We barely managed to book a meeting
and you throw it away like that?

426
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,430
What kind of first impression is that?

427
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,260
We won't be meeting him at all,
so why do first impressions matter?

428
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,950
- What?
- That's right.

429
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,110
Sit down, President. Sit, sit.

430
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,810
Everyone, sit down. You too, Yeon Soo.

431
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,210
President, you too.

432
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,400
Here.

433
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,270
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

434
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,060
Everyone calm down.
I have a presentation to make.

435
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
We all need to have a discussion.
Why are you talking?

436
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,720
It will relate to Mango.

437
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,120
Prepare yourselves for it.
It's okay to cry, okay?

438
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,450
That's the title of a song.

439
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,170
President Shin wants
to send us off to a better place.

440
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,990
I understand the good intention.

441
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,410
But... that means
you're throwing us away.

442
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,910
Stop saying nonsense.

443
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,300
Listen to what I have to say.

444
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,710
Don't interrupt me. I'm serious.

445
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,560
"I don't think I can raise you well."

446
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:56,810
"Meet better parents, get adopted,
and grow up in a better environment."

447
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,980
To that child, it's being thrown away.
It's not being sent away.

448
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,490
Why would you bring up adoption?

449
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,720
Pull yourself together.

450
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,180
You can't confirm if adoptive parents
are better or not.

451
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,060
I have never met my biological parents.

452
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,950
How could I know if they're better
or worse than my adoptive parents?

453
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,750
I grew up in a good environment.

454
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,810
I grew up happy, with good parents.

455
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:33,640
They supported me a lot
in doing what I liked.

456
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,800
And I got accepted into Juilliard.

457
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,220
I'm adopted.

458
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,340
When I saw Yeon Soo,
I thought he was amazing.

459
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,690
It also made me think...

460
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:02,870
why did my biological parents
throw me away?

461
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,520
My dad said I cried so much
when I was adopted.

462
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,930
He wanted me to live my life smiling,
so he named me Lee Bang Geul.

463
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,940
It might be a better environment.

464
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,940
Even if we're a little bit poor
and it's a little bit hard...

465
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,920
I wonder what it would have been like
to have lived with my biological parents.

466
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,970
I think about that a lot.

467
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,090
You want us to go to a better company?

468
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,700
What is better?

469
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,530
What's the criteria?

470
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,260
Who gets to determine that?

471
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,800
See, I knew you would need tissues.

472
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,730
It's okay to cry.

473
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,960
Gosh, that song title is just so useful.

474
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:16,920
What is this?

475
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,360
No one is crying?

476
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,460
I just told you my painful family story.

477
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,670
It was very touching.

478
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,210
Why is it that no tears are coming out?

479
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,350
You guys don't think I'm lying, do you?

480
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,630
Shouldn't you cry with me, Geu Rin?
You're adopted too.

481
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,410
I wasn't adopted.

482
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,310
I'm still legally registered
under my parents.

483
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,050
Ha Neul's parents took me in
because my parents passed away.

484
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,920
Huh! What the heck?

485
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,430
I thought Ha Neul's family adopted you.

486
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:53,930
I was so good to you.

487
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,680
You were? To me?

488
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,940
Regardless, Kyle is right.

489
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,010
Are you going to throw us away like this?

490
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,480
Gosh, I'm going to go insane.

491
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,010
I'm not throwing you guys away.

492
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,330
Entertainer Band will lose what
you've achieved if I leave for a while.

493
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,370
How can all of you
be so dense about this?

494
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:15,640
I think it's you who's being dense.

495
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,350
We all understand.
Why are you the only one?

496
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,460
We'll work really hard and make them
bigger than Wild Company would.

497
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,600
Yeah, that's right.

498
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,460
We don't even want to move fast.

499
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:30,360
Even if it takes us longer,
we want to do it together.

500
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,310
With you, President Shin.

501
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:45,270
To commemorate our fighting spirit,
let's go on a trip!

502
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,710
I've never gone on a trip.
Not even in college.

503
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,310
Sounds good. Let's go.

504
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,960
Dad, are we going on a trip?

505
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,300
I hope so.

506
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,760
President Shin, looks like
you'd better treat everyone.

507
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,440
We all worked so hard
getting over big hurdles.

508
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,700
We're all going, right?

509
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,970
President Byun, Man Shik...
and Section Chief Yeo.

510
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,330
What? Weren't you going to invite me?

511
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,810
What are you guys thinking?

512
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:13,410
If you're not going to Wild,
you should work hard and make money.

513
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,070
Let's go this one time!

514
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,830
Where should we go?
The ocean, a valley...

515
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,100
Or, Southeast Asia!

516
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,260
Wow!

517
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,510
Is your back okay?

518
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,820
Buy me some medication.

519
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,920
You're so heavy.

520
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,630
Our stock price is dropping too quickly.

521
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,750
At this rate, there's a good chance
our stock could be delisted...

522
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,700
Book a meeting
with the all station chiefs.

523
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,130
Chairman, I don't think the boycott
of the broadcast stations is the issue.

524
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,890
The actors and singers in our company are
preparing a contract termination lawsuit.

525
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,320
What kind of crap are you saying?

526
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,050
They are claiming that the agency
affected their image negatively.

527
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,480
How about this place?

528
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,180
It's nice. There's a barbecue too!

529
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,350
Wonder which one he'd prefer...

530
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:21,690
I like them all.

531
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,000
Oh, you were wondering
about President Shin.

532
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
No, I meant both of you.

533
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,700
Oh yeah.

534
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,550
Suk Ho has this pretty green umbrella
that doesn't suit him.

535
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,880
Did you give it to him?

536
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,340
Oh, that?

537
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,800
He was walking without an umbrella,
so I gave it to him.

538
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,010
Something that pretty
doesn't suit Suk Ho.

539
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,320
A big black umbrella like this
would be better for him.

540
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,050
Right? That's so true.

541
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,610
Oh, I totally forgot. I have a meeting.

542
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,940
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

543
00:41:17,964 --> 00:41:29,964

544
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,610
I don't have my car keys or my wallet.

545
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,130
I don't want to go back inside.

546
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,620
Damn!

547
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,060
Where are you going?

548
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:47,030
Oh.

549
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,490
Is something wrong?

550
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,600
No, something is in my eye.

551
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,400
Aren't you going to the office?

552
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,350
Go on in. I'm headed out.

553
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:01,360
You don't have car keys or a bag.

554
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,710
Where are you going?

555
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,320
Are your shoes comfortable?

556
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,890
It's perfect for walking,
both your shoes and the weather.

557
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,740
Let's stop walking now. My legs hurt.

558
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,870
Why were you crying?

559
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,240
I cried my eyes out in front of you.

560
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,830
It was embarrassing for me as a man.

561
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,780
I told you why I was upset.

562
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,820
Can't you tell me?

563
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,280
Only if you can keep a secret.

564
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,410
I'm not Kyle.

565
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,710
Where should I start?

566
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,440
If I start from 10 years ago,
talking all night wouldn't be enough.

567
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:14,390
Where should I start...
about Shin Suk Ho.

568
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,600
You must like President Shin.

569
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,790
Funny, right?

570
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:25,000
You've known him for over 10 years.
Why didn't you ever tell him?

571
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,560
Because he might run away.

572
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:33,080
If I told him that I liked him,
I thought it might get awkward.

573
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,840
I thought it would be hard
to stay friends.

574
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,420
That was why.

575
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,460
But, why are you crying now?

576
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,620
Suk Ho...

577
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,170
I found out that he likes someone else.

578
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,450
I think I cried because
I was so taken aback.

579
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,070
You'll keep my secret, right?

580
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,870
Of course, I will.

581
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,550
But, I don't think it's love
you're feeling.

582
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,530
Love isn't something
that you can hide for that long.

583
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,220
If you truly love someone,
you can't endure not telling them.

584
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,220
I don't like you either.

585
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:31,230
You're too straightforward.

586
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,930
That's how it is.

587
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,630
Love is straightforward.

588
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,480
At my age, it's a little embarrassing
to be so straightforward.

589
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,850
35 is a good age to start a new love.

590
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,590
I'm 34!

591
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,930
You're not the same age
as President Shin?

592
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,640
I didn't want to acknowledge
that he was older, so I lied.

593
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,200
If I knew he liked younger girls,
I wouldn't have lied.

594
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,790
You're cuter than Geu Rin.

595
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,270
You seem to know more than I do.

596
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,410
Me? No, I don't.

597
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,860
Well, what I know is that
you are a very awesome woman.

598
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,680
You have looks, talent,
and even a good family.

599
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,000
You need a lot of courage
to be more straightforward.

600
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,180
That's about all I know.

601
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:23,360
Thanks for the kind words.

602
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,760
Let's go now.

603
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,100
Your legs hurt, right?
What should we do?

604
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,290
I'll walk it off.

605
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:40,040
I'll walk and think about
whether this is friendship or love.

606
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,510
Let me ponder on that.

607
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,300
We'll be in trouble if someone

608
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,430
takes our picture
walking around together like this.

609
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,130
Then I'll just say that I pursued you.

610
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,730
No way! Your fans will hate me.

611
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:09,500
I'm hurt. You should've
at least told me.

612
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,990
What's wrong with being adopted?

613
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,490
Well, I didn't care about it
when I was in the States.

614
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,260
It seems different in Korea.

615
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,150
I thought I might get looked down on.

616
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,370
You must have been
really upset back then.

617
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,900
When?

618
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,690
When I was giving up and leaving.

619
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,380
I asked you if you thought I was
the director of an orphanage.

620
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,980
Did I ask you to feed me?

621
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,960
I only wanted to make music.

622
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,260
I'm being treated like an orphan.

623
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,270
It must have been an inferiority complex.

624
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,920
I didn't know anything and talked about
being the director of an orphanage.

625
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,520
It must've been so upsetting.

626
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,600
Gosh, life is like a boomerang.

627
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,550
The important thing is...
Where are we going on our trip?

628
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,960
If we can't go to Southeast Asia,
can we go to Jeju Island?

629
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,460
One thing is for sure about both
your adoptive and biological parents

630
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,400
I am sure they are both very kind.

631
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,160
How can you be so happy
and talk about going on the trip?

632
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,580
I have to succeed, President.

633
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,630
My adoptive parents are still mad
that I quit Juilliard and joined a band.

634
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,710
We'll get into the Hallyu market.
We'll go to the States.

635
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:18,140
They'll love me there.

636
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,100
Yes, Shin Suk Ho speaking. Yes.

637
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,230
What?

638
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,260
Yes, of course.

639
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,600
Don't do it.

640
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,240
They want a commercial. Why not?

641
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,730
A band should be on stage,
not filming commercials.

642
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,550
Hey, then why do actors do commercials?
They should only act.

643
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,100
They say Yeon Soo is perfect for it,
so how great is that?

644
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,350
He can earn money and save up
for Chan Hee's education.

645
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,490
Yes, but why must it be...

646
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,120
Jaeo Group's With Me Apartments
is a big deal.

647
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,830
Why are you being like this, Min Joo?

648
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,940
I'm saying you should not ruin Yeon Soo's
good image by getting involved with Jaeo.

649
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,570
Aren't you taking this too personally,
Yeo Min Joo?

650
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:10,380
There are four more of Sung Hyun's
songs on Choi Joon Ha's album.

651
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,040
Section Chief Yeo was thinking
we should remake them.

652
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,360
Would Choi Joon Ha
be all right with that?

653
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,810
He was the one who suggested it.

654
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,470
I think we should discuss it with Suk Ho.

655
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,880
I will be working on some songs
on my own with Man Shik.

656
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,840
We should consider
writing some new songs.

657
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,580
- Hi.
- Hello.

658
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,390
Wow, Entertainer Band
working hard into the night.

659
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,590
You're in a good mood, President.
You must have good news.

660
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,130
Are we going on a Southeast Asia trip?

661
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,320
I don't like you.

662
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,500
Well, we received another request
for a commercial.

663
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,030
- Commercial?
- Wow!

664
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,570
Wait, wait, wait!
Is it a beer commercial?

665
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,450
- An apartment commercial!
- Apartment?

666
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,620
Wow, you need a really good image
to do apartment commercials.

667
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,670
Our image is really starting
to appeal to people.

668
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,220
The commercial offer is not
for Entertainer Band this time.

669
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,490
It is only for our Na Yeon Soo.

670
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,030
- What?
- Wow.

671
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,560
The news is full of terrible stories

672
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,070
about the irresponsibility
of young people.

673
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,140
Na Yeon Soo is raising a son on his own
and living out his dream.

674
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,640
With Me Apartments feel that you

675
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,530
suit their company image
and have selected you.

676
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:24,520
Wait, With Me Apartments...
Jaeo Group!

677
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,030
Hey, what is this?
Are you really dating Section Chief Yeo?

678
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,640
Section Chief Yeo
put in a good word for you.

679
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,230
There he goes again.

680
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,690
I told you I'm not.
How could I possibly be with her?

681
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:35,930
Stop saying nonsense.

682
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:39,830
Section Chief Yeo
was actually against it.

683
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,370
She feels that Yeon Soo's image
is too good for them and opposed it.

684
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,560
How do you feel, Yeon Soo?

685
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,160
I don't really know.

686
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,220
How can I shoot it on my own?

687
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,010
Can't we all do it together?

688
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,320
You're perfect for it.

689
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,680
That company's marketing team
is good at their job.

690
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,380
Can I stand in the back?

691
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,880
I can do it for nothing.

692
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,380
You'll look pathetic. Don't do that.

693
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:04,610
You better treat us big time
when you get paid.

694
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:09,310
First, why don't we go our trip?

695
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,280
Why don't we shoot the commercial
and then go?

696
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,670
So annoying.

697
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,300
Geu Rin, meet Jaeo Group's
marketing team to go over the contract.

698
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:21,080
No, we should go to the office first
and organize at Mango.

699
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,170
Okay, President.

700
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,200
You're dating Section Chief Yeo, right?
She helped you, right?

701
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,080
Stop it. Enough, already.

702
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,030
Give me an apartment then.

703
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,260
Ready... action!

704
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,390
How about it?

705
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,980
Should we...

706
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,450
live together?

707
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,390
With Me.

708
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:55,730
Cut!

709
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,560
All right, okay. It's fine, it's fine.

710
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,660
Yeon Soo, try to think about
the first time you started dating.

711
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,070
It was so sweet.
So, so, so sweet.

712
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,160
You know what I mean? You can do it.

713
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,940
Make up, please. Wipe away the sweat.

714
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,190
Come on, come on. Up, up!

715
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,400
Good.

716
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,140
Sorry, everyone.

717
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,340
Think about a girl you used to like.
Heart beating.

718
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,810
Right, okay?

719
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,610
No, that's not it.

720
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,980
You get all sad when you
think about Chan Hee's mom.

721
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,230
I'm so bad at this, right? What do I do?

722
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,480
Well...

723
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,190
Think about a celebrity that you like.

724
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,100
Who knows? You might end up dating
a pretty celebrity if you become a star.

725
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,500
That sounds great. Smile!

726
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,840
This is not the time for joking.

727
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,280
Focus, okay?

728
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,970
Okay, we're ready.

729
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,880
Did you come to see
because you were bored?

730
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:59,470
I came to see
just how bad the concept was.

731
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,100
Yeon Soo, let's try to do it
in one take this time!

732
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,470
Make it sweet!
Yes, sweetness coming! Ready?

733
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,400
Good, good, good.... action!

734
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:21,924

735
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,370
How about it?

736
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,300
Should we live together?

737
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,560
With Me.

738
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,670
Cut!

739
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,860
That was so good! Totally great.

740
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,070
But, you should be looking at the camera.
Where are you looking?

741
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,270
I'm so sorry.

742
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,680
- It was so good too.
- Should we live together?

743
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,450
With me, with me...

744
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,310
I don't think I can watch anymore.

745
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,000
Min Joo.

746
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,070
Shut up if you're going to say
something ridiculous.

747
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:07,590
That article is real, isn't it?

748
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,490
What?

749
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,620
Come on. Let's live together,
Section Chief.

750
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,500
Should we live together, Section Chief?

751
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,670
I told you to stop it.

752
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,610
I like you so much, Yeon Soo.

753
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,170
I can do it really well too.

754
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,370
How about it? Should we...

755
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,630
Just drive.

756
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,200
Okay.

757
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:54,730
Aloha, aloha!

758
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,630
We're going to Gapyeong.

759
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,800
You must think we're going to Hawaii.

760
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,150
Leave me alone. My heart feels Hawaii.

761
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,730
Don't ruin my dreams. Aloha.

762
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:07,800
Dad, are we going now?

763
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,380
Chan Hee, we'll go when
Aunt Geu Rin gets here.

764
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,250
Where is Aunt Geu Rin?

765
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,680
She went to buy groceries
to make you yummy food.

766
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,070
She'll buy Hanwoo beef, right?

767
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,480
Let's move everything into the van
and pick up everyone at home.

768
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,210
Is everyone else coming on their own?

769
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,230
They're coming in Man Shik's car.

770
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,240
Okay. This is going to be so fun!

771
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,380
- Are you that happy?
- Yes.

772
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,760
This is my first group trip.
I didn't even go in school.

773
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,370
This is going to be fun.

774
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,060
How far did you get in school?

775
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,220
One semester in my second year.

776
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,900
- Your major?
- Veterinary Science.

777
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,790
I was pretty good in school too.
I got into a college in Seoul.

778
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,890
Veterinary Science.

779
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,090
That suits you perfectly.

780
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,630
You would be good
at giving shots to dogs.

781
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:57,700
My professor did say I looked like
a puppy, so it was perfect for me.

782
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,870
Let's stop by one more place.

783
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:10,980
Where?

784
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,590
Sunglasses are a necessity for vacations.

785
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,790
How about these for you?

786
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,750
- Choose your own.
- Mine?

787
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:28,550
You'll complain that the sun
is hurting your eyes while you drive.

788
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,570
It's okay.

789
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:31,180
Pick a pair before I change my mind.

790
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,320
Even an expensive pair?

791
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,180
Choose a pair that suits you.

792
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,850
I'm pretty, so everything suits me.

793
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,410
That's true.

794
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,200
Pick a pair.

795
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,070
What do you think?

796
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,980
Looks good.

797
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,280
You're here?

798
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,450
- Hi.
- Hello.

799
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,250
Wow, this place is great.

800
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,840
What is all this food?
Who's going to eat it all?

801
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,980
People eat a lot.

802
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:29,000
Jump.

803
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,940
Wow, this place is great.

804
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,660
- Tada.
- Ginseng alcohol.

805
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:40,640
It's something similar to ginseng.

806
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,470
You should have brought
a 21 year-old whiskey.

807
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,520
This is like for old grandpas.

808
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:49,870
You have no idea
how good this is for men.

809
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,530
Man Shik isn't having any.

810
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:55,270
When did I say I wasn't having any?

811
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,330
How is it good for you?

812
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,850
There are kids listening here.

813
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,740
I'm here.

814
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,760
Yeah!

815
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,600
What did you buy?

816
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,600
I bought Hanwoo beef and lobster.

817
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,670
Wow, Hanwoo and lobster.
Billionaires are the best!

818
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,710
Hey!

819
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,060
Should we live together?

820
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:18,110
Hey, have you been hit
by a lobster before?

821
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,220
Oh, wait.

822
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:23,090
- Oh!
- Wow, that's big.

823
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,720
This lobster is so big!

824
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,300
You'll hurt your back.
This is the heaviest item.

825
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,460
Thank you.

826
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,430
- It's so nice.
- We could share this with everyone!

827
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,800
Dad, you have to win.

828
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,410
Kick it over here.

829
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,950
What are you doing, Man Shik?

830
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,000
I'm good at soccer.

831
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,670
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

832
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,640
- Throw it.
- Go, Aunt Min Joo!

833
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,150
I got it.

834
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,750
Kick it.

835
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,420
Man Shik!

836
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,490
- How sad.
- What?

837
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:16,310
He feels like a teenager in his heart,
but look how bad he is.

838
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,700
I feel sorry for him. I can't watch.

839
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:24,970
I'm going to go inside to eat lobster.

840
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,980
Oh dear...

841
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,970
Seriously!

842
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:34,960
Kyle and that mouth of his.
He is so noisy.

843
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,620
I got this.

844
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,840
Yeon Soo is good at sports.

845
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,980
Yeah, he is. Aren't you going to join in?

846
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,780
I'm still injured from carrying you.

847
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,840
Who told you to carry me?
I'm usually good at walking around.

848
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,160
You're good at walking around?
Seriously?

849
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,300
I should have taken a video of you.

850
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,870
- Ouch.
- Oh, it's hot.

851
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,640
Okay, okay. I got it.

852
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:11,260
My ball, my ball, my ball!

853
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,190
Use your head.

854
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:19,910
Gosh, are you okay?

855
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,260
I'm okay.

856
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,990
President, when are you
getting your driver's license back?

857
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,190
Why? Do you feel bad for Manager Jung?

858
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,180
What are you talking about?

859
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,980
President Shin is here to work.
Why else would he be here?

860
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,740
I'm not adopted.

861
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,640
I'm still legally registered
under my parents.

862
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,230
Okay, okay.

863
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:51,120
My ball, my ball!

864
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,450
Why is she putting
so much effort into that?

865
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,740
- Be careful.
- Okay.

866
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,180
- Get it, get it. Okay?
- All right.
