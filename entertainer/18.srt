3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,260
- Is it done cooking?
- So much smoke.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,680
Looks good.

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,200
It looks so yummy.

6
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,120
- Here.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,390
Is it good?

8
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,740
Oh, it's hot.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,190
It's so hot.

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,340
Drink a little bit at a time.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,100
Oh!

12
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,650
Why is Jin Woo number one
in the search rankings again?

13
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,940
- Huh?
- What is this?

14
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,930
<i>To all my fans. This is Jin Woo.</i>

15
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,940
<i>I saw Choi Joon Ha's confession</i>

16
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,180
<i>and I haven't been able
to sleep for a few days.</i>

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,500
<i>With a heart full of fear,
I would like to make a confession.</i>

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,110
<i>"Don't Touch", released last fall,
was not written by me.</i>

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,710
<i>The song and lyrics were written
by songwriter Jang Min Soo.</i>

20
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,030
<i>I found out about that
after it was released.</i>

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>I'm not trying to absolve myself
of any wrongdoing.</i>

22
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>I should have turned things around
when I found out.</i>

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,320
<i>I didn't have the courage to do it.</i>

24
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,510
<i>You are all
disappointed in me, aren't you?</i>

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,890
<i>I am sorry for showing you all
this side of me.</i>

26
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,100
<i>I wanted to give this song back to its
rightful owner, even if it's too late.</i>

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,700
<i>I am letting everything go
and will leave to study music.</i>

28
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,840
<i>I will start from the beginning
and study music.</i>

29
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,220
<i>Once time has passed, I hope a day comes
when you can forgive me.</i>

30
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,270

when I can see you all on stage again.</i>

31

<i>I want to apologize and say goodbye.</i>

32
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,940
Yeah, Suk Ho.

33
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,180
I told you everything was taken care of.
Why did you bother...

34
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,930
Are you okay?

35
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,660
I'm running away because I'm scared.

36
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,700
What?

37
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,780
I'm kidding. I'm at the airport.

38
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,870
Come to England when you get some money.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,480
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,360
I want to go and learn English,
then look into schools.

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,870
Hey kid, you should have
come to see me before you left.

42
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,480
I didn't tell you on purpose.

43
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,720
I thought you might
come to the airport and cry.

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,080
You're a really bad kid.

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,200
How can you leave like this?

46
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,300
Call me if you need anything.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,140
I'll fly over it you need me.

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,900
Also, call me when you arrive.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,280
Suk Ho...

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,230
Thank you.

51
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,390
I'll do really well over there.

52
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,710
I think I'll miss you most.

53
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,360
Thank you so much.

54
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,370
Come back, Lee Jin Woo!

55
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,390
Jin Woo, we love you!

56
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,090
Come back, Lee Jin Woo!

57
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,060
Jin Woo, we love you!

58
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,930
Come back, Lee Jin Woo!

59
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,890
Jin Woo, we love you!

60
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,650
Come back, Lee Jin Woo!

61
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,460
Jin Woo, we love you!

62
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,310
Come back, Lee Jin Woo!

63
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,960
Wow, it's so pretty here.

64
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,470
- Geu Rin.
- Yeah?

65
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,720
I really liked you.

66
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,600
When you first came to our house,
I liked you so much.

67
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,210
After my brother left,
our house was so depressing.

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,150
But, my mom and dad started
smiling again after you came.

69
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,370
I think I should be saying that.

70
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,850
After living at my aunt's place, I moved
to your house and started to smile.

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,790
I'm the one who's thankful.

72
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,200
I think it was when I was a sophomore.

73
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,560
When my dad wanted you to be
Jo Geu Rin instead of Jung Geu Rin.

74
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,170
I was so glad that you said no.

75
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,540
If we had become real siblings,
my first love would have come to an end.

76
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,080
Ha Neul, I...

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,940
I watched you be excited with your
first love like I was with my first love.

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,210
So, I decided to let it go.

79
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,700
Suk Ho is good person.

80
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,560
Hey, what are you talking about?

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,010
You are really obvious.

82
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,180
Ha Neul, you are a really great guy.

83
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,050
You're tall, handsome, and kind too.

84
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,130
Are you trying to console me?

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,050
Later...

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,170
Later, I want to see your mom,
dad, and brother in heaven.

87
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,980
I want to be a good daughter
to them then too.

88
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,670
I want them to praise me
for taking good care of you.

89
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,420
I think I took better care of you.

90
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,980
Honestly, I'm more like
your older brother.

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,730
I was there when you went
through puberty and your voice changed.

92
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,040
Gosh.

93
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,150
Oh no, I'm in trouble.

94
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,260
What now?

95
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,510
I'm going to be so popular later.

96
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:52,230
Your parents and my parents will fight
over who gets to keep me as a daughter.

97
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,760
What should I do?

98
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,410
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,550
This darn popularity of mine.

100
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,880
You're not actually popular.

101
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,290
Did you just hit me?

102
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,640
Stop it, stop it.

103
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,850
- I got it!
- They sure are having fun.

104
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,680
It's Chan Hee's turn.

105
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,940
I knew you'd do that.

106
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,480
<i>Your name has been removed from the list
of winners for this year's Asian Award.</i>

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,750
<i>We just received notice,
so we couldn't do anything about it.</i>

108
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,950
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

109
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
There's no need to apologize.

110
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,450
I'm not going to cry over an award.

111
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,470
I understand. Thank you.

112
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,050
You know what the KTOP singers
and actors are intending to do, right?

113
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,270
You've been notified
that KTOP's stock will be delisted.

114
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,630
Yet, the talent you represent say
that they will stay if the CEO is gone.

115
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,080
Isn't that a relief?

116
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,690
I am planning on starting over
from the very beginning.

117
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,790
Your shares will take a very big hit
if the stock is delisted.

118
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,310
But, isn't this a big loss for regular
people who hold those shares?

119
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,840
What is it that you want?

120
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,060
Sell KTOP to Wild Company.

121
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,680
You need to avoid the stock delisting
and get what you can out of your shares.

122
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,980
You can open a store somewhere
and make a living for your family.

123
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,650
There is no hope for KTOP.

124
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,920
The only company willing to run it
will be us, Wild Company.

128
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,470
If you're going to have them run,
all four of them should do it.

129
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,700
It works perfectly.

130
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,700
We can negotiate the guarantee later.

131
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,650
Then Kyle can do it.

132
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,640
He has the best feel for variety shows.

133
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,930
All right.

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,800
I'll come see you tomorrow
at the broadcast station.

135
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,070
Yes, bye.

136
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,440
You don't have an umbrella?

137
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,230
No.

138
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
Your mom's not coming?

139
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,010
She's at work.

<i>[ONE YEAR LATER]</i>

142
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,780
You're all wet.
I should've brought you an umbrella.

143
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,290
- Are they done shooting?
- Not yet.

144
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,700
Ha Neul needs to see
Writer Kim when he's done.

145
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,400
I'll take Kyle to his variety show shoot.

146
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,730
What about Jae Hoon and Yeon Soo?

147
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,850
What happened to the road manager
I told you to hire?

148
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,570
Section Chief Yeo
is still looking into it.

149
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,400
Tell her to get over here right now.

150
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Yes, all right.

152
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,510
Will it be Entertainer Band
for the fourth consecutive week?

153
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,880
Or will it be NowBoyz
who are in hot pursuit.

Congratulations, it is Entertainer Band!

Congratulations!

159
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,030
Yes! They won.

160
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,950

176
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,510
<i>Just like a fairy,
you carry me and fly.</i>

177
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,630
<i>To the edge of the sky and sun.</i>

178
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,940
<i>You will stay with me.</i>

179
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,310
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it either.

180
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,100
President Byun, it's not just me
who doesn't like it.

181
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,370
None of our singers like it.

182
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,440
Putting Smiley Distribution on the album
makes people question our company.

183
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,260
Well, Mango makes us
sound like a fruit store!

184
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,650
Fine then.

185
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,020
I'll back off on the name of the company.

186
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,530
We'll call it Mango Music.

187
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,690
Let's discuss the next item.

188
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,880
What else is there?

189
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,220
We need a company representative.

190
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,250
Representative?

191
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,540
We have one, Yeo Min Joo.

192
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,560
That would be thievery.

193
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,970
We also have Byun Kil Joo.

194
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,330
President Byun.

195
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,260
Entertainer Band's second
and Park Sung Ho's third album

196
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,980
- you know I made them both, right?
- I know.

197
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,250
But, every company
has a critical turning point.

198
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,070
Don't you remember
Entertainer Band's "I See You"?

199
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,860
If Smiley Distribution hadn't used the
christian contemporary music connections

200
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,320
that song would have never
have made it out into the world, okay?

201
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,110
So, you want Mango Music
to be under your system?

202
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,260
That would be thievery too.

203
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,800
Yeo Min Joo and Byun Kil Joo.

204
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,960
Wow, we both have "Joo" in our names,
now that I think about it.

205
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,630
We should be co-representatives.

206
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,720
Co-representatives?

207
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,270
- What do you think of being a Director?
- How about Director Yeo?

208
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,670
Fine, we'll do it.

209
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,710
You have to have that on your business
card in order to get married someday.

210
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,230
Oh my! Then, let's make
business cards soon.

211
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,920
I have a arranged date next week.

212
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,590
Let's see...

213
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,600
Don't we need to hire more employees?
The two of us aren't enough.

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,950
I hear you're forming a girl group.

215
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,140
I hired one person who knows
everything about this industry.

216
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,540
Why did you do that by yourself?

217
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,680
I have to see what she looks like.

218
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,060
I like an Asian beauty...

219
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,030
Must be here.

220
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,000
Come on in.

221
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,150
Well, the office is very cozy.

222
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,080
It's very charming.

223
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,000
Did you finish up
at the chicken restaurant?

224
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,760
You insisted that you needed me here.

225
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,580
I had to leave that place.
What could I do?

226
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,140
Thank you for agreeing to come.

227
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,330
If you were going to hire,
couldn't you...

228
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,510
Maintenance man?

229
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,220
That's President Byun of Mango Music.

230
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,130
You have another President here?

231
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,150
How can there be two in this tiny place?

232
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,550
I oppose this hiring.

233
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,060
You look like a very good man, President.

234
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,860
Wow, you have great style too.

235
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,730
You're like Kim Kwang Seok.

236
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,560
I'm a big fan of Kim Kwang Seok.

237
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,600
Should we have a drink and talk?

238
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,840
This is Jo Ha Neul
and this is the writer.

239
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
Hello.

240
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,800
Nice to meet you.
I'm a fan of Entertainer Band.

241
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,870
Thank you.

242
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,710
I've seen all your TV dramas.
They are really fun.

243
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,720
I'm more thankful to hear that.

244
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,360
You have a kind face,
so you'd suit our character well.

245
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Thank you.

246
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Have you read the script?

247
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,390
He's a character who experiences
unrequited love. What do you think?

248
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,900
I know I'll be great at
an unrequited love story.

249
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,970
I told you to take him home
when he was done with his variety show!

250
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,290
I checked on him taking a shower
and going to bed.

251
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,580
Wait until I catch him. He's dead!

252
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,410
- Hey, find him!
- Okay.

253
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,130
I like this place better than home.

254
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,550
Man Shik, your bounce dance was like...

255
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,540
Wait, you're not a regular here.

256
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,570
I switched clubs.
The music is better here.

257
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:20,490
Of course, you're no regular clubber.

258
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,230
You're a true club maniac.

259
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,070
Cheers!

260
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,380
Put that bottle down now.

261
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,430
I must have been too close
to the speaker. I'm hearing things now.

262
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,790
Yeah, I have to suddenly pee.

263
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,640
- Me too, me too.
- Let's go.

264
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,250
Oh, you're here?

265
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,490
Did you bring him here, Man Shik?

266
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,090
No, this is my regular club and
I happened to run into him here.

267
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,520
I have to pee.

268
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,460
Let's go home.

269
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,740
President, there are pretty girls here.
Should we go out together? Oh yeah!

270
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,940
Using just words
don't seem to work with you.

271
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,450
You are dead now. Close the door.

272
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,560
Why are you closing the door?

273
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,780
You're working hard late into the night.

274
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,360
Yes, I am working a lot.

275
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,370
A new club could open
with all the money you've spent in clubs.

276
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,400
Aren't you tired?

277
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,880
Of course, I'm tired. You hit me.

278
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,190
Then why do you go to those clubs
every day like they are your office?

279
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,060
I don't know. I guess I'm bored.

280
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,850
Then get a hobby or start exercising.

281
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,330
Dancing is exercising.

282
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,900
You should've become an idol then.
Why did you join a band?

283
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,770
It's too late to become an idol.

284
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,700
All right, I'll cut back.

285
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,390
Don't cut back. Just quit.

286
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,000
Do you want to go to the States
to visit your parents? I can schedule it.

287
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,910
They're visiting me next month.

288
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,180
Go ahead and try being a club addict.

289
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,170
I'll just keep going there to catch you.

290
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,540
This is good.

291
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:18,564

292
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,060
We're done.
Let's go eat something good.

293
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,120
Okay, what should we eat?

294
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,480
Pork belly?

295
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,880
Yeah! Let's go.

296
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,350
Have you had pork belly with leeks?
It's good.

297
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,710
- Really?
- Unlimited refills too.

298
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,490
Let's go, let's go.

299
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,560
Wait up.

300
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,900
Okay.

301
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,420
Sorry, Geu Rin.

302
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,740
You looked like my friend from the back.

303
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,240
No one hangs out with me
because I'm older.

304
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:22,390
<i>[DADDY LONG LEGS]</i>

305
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,040
<i>[DADDY LONG LEGS]</i>

306
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,840
What about a place to stay?

307
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,220
The agency in China
will let us know by tomorrow.

308
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,950
- What about the flight?
- I took care of that.

309
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,550
I will fly out with this ticket
and report back to you.

310
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,170
How many times did you go
to Shanghai with Lucy Girls?

311
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,510
Three or four times.

312
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,570
Do a good job there.

313
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,550
It's open. No one finds out
where they are staying.

314
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,560
I understand.

315
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,850
You can go home now.
See you tomorrow.

316
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,260
You're not going home yet?

317
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,470
I'm going to read Ha Neul's script.

318
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,540
Then I'll get going.

319
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,410
"His Romance."

320
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,680
His Romance...

321
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,370
She must be excited
about something again.

322
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,690
President!

323
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,210
Why are you always here?

324
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,540
You wanted to finish school.

325
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,720
You said you should be on campus in your
20s and handed in your resignation.

326
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,680
You should go study.
Why do you keep coming here?

327
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,110
Be honest. You're happy to see me.

328
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,740
No, you're always complaining
about how hard school is. Go home.

329
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,820
It's just that I found something
very interesting today.

330
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,250
I thought you should know.

331
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,750
I have no interest in veterinary science.

332
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,940
Why do I need to know?

333
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,350
It's not veterinary science.

334
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,970
It's this.

335
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,160
<i>[DADDY LONG LEGS]</i>

336
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,240
Have you read this book?

337
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,270
I'm not interested in literature either.

338
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,190
I'm busy reading Ha Neul's script,
so you should go home.

339
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,510
Then just read the last page because
that's the most important part.

340
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,140
Take it with you.

341
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,940
- Have you had dinner?
- I'm very full.

342
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,430
Then I suppose I should go home
and have a sad bowl of cereal.

343
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:49,430
I'll have ramen if I'm still hungry.

344
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,250
I'll have rice if I'm still hungry.

345
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,040
Go home quietly and eat.

346
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,620
Why do I need to know your dinner menu?

347
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,740
You don't need to know.

348
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,130
I feel a bit lonely. Bye then.

349
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,310
Did you look into your own place?

350
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,660
No, I've been busy.

351
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,820
The kids are moving to a different place.

352
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,760
You need to tell the manager
if you're going to stay with them.

353
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,330
That way we can look into a place.

354
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,170
I should move out.

355
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,430
Did you really eat dinner?

356
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,020
I ate so much I have indigestion.

357
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,770
Anyway, make sure to read
the last page of this book.

358
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,890
Bye now.

359
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,730
<i>[TWO PEOPLE EVENTUALLY BELONG TO ONE
ANOTHER. DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS GRAND?]</i>

360
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,110
<i>At the end of "Daddy Long Legs",
they marry and live happily together.</i>

361
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,500
<i>I just wanted to tell you.</i>

362
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,380
Yes, Yeon Soo.

363
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,250
Here you go. My goodness.

364
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,670
His dad was supposed to be here
by nine, but he didn't show up.

365
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,910
He was waiting up
but then he fell asleep.

366
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,280
The shoot must have ended late.

367
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,380
It's nice that his dad is famous now,
but Chan Hee must be bored.

368
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,400
He's at the age
where he needs his parents.

369
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,120
But, he never ever complains.
He's such a good boy.

370
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,670
Just like Chan Hee's dad.

371
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,280
Once we relocate to a new place, we'll
hire someone to look after Chan Hee.

372
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,630
Please take care of him until then.

373
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,950
I can keep watching him.

374
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,310
You're too far away.

375
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,290
It's too hard to pick him up.
I'll be going now.

376
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,800
You should get married
and give us grandchildren too.

377
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,970
Okay. I'm going now.

378
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,380
All right! Here are your beverages.

379
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,380
We're sorry, but can we get
your autographs and pictures?

380
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,420
Sorry, but no pictures.

381
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,620
- I'm such a big fan.
- Sorry.

382
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,800
Sorry.

383
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,520
You must remember
your days as our manager.

384
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,990
It's just automatic for you.

385
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,510
If you have something to say,
why not say it at home?

386
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,780
Why are we out here?

387
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,230
She's even treating us.
She must need a favor from us.

388
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,370
I said I would pay.

389
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:40,900
I can't let you do that.
I'm paying, so enjoy your drinks.

390
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,310
Jae Hoon, what did you order?

391
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,970
Kyle, I want to switch.
You got your germs all over mine.

392
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,620
Mine tastes better.

393
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,870
Gosh, seriously.

394
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,140
Tell us what it is you want to say.

395
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,080
I need a favor from all of you.

396
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,400
Come to my school just once.

397
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,060
Think of your former manager
and come visit me at school.

398
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,610
I don't think it's
a very difficult thing to ask.

399
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,270
Is something wrong?

400
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,800
Wouldn't that be considered an event?

401
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,570
Are there a lot of pretty girls?

402
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,920
I haven't seen anyone prettier than me.

403
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,970
Then why would we go there?

404
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,490
Did you discuss it with our manager?

405
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,830
Wow! You guys have really changed.

406
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,130
You shouldn't do this to me, Kyle.

407
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,110
When you were crying at the police
station, I came all the way from Busan?

408
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,770
I wasn't crying!

409
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,640
All right, but still you guys,
can you come out just one time.

410
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,540
No one will play with me because
I'm a student who went back to school.

411
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,760
I sit alone in lectures and I eat alone.

412
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,870
Geu Rin, many people in my classes
go around alone too.

413
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,120
If Entertainer Band shows up,
my campus life will get much better.

414
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,900
I'll treat you all to dinner, okay?

415
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll treat you all.

416
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,630
Hey! President Shin
wants you all at the office now.

417
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,060
Let's go, let's go. Hurry.

418
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,360
Oh goodness.

419
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960
My shaved ice...

420
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,150
Give me an answer before you leave.

421
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:06,060
- Hey!
- Hurry up, hurry up!

422
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,020
Hey, give me an answer.

423
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,660
Really?

424
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,530
President Shin Suk Ho!

425
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,050
You have such bad timing.
So bad, so bad.

426
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,990
Drink these.

427
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,540
We're going to finish up our second album
promotion with a fan meeting in Shanghai.

428
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,850
Ha Neul will be shooting a drama soon.

429
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,100
Then what should we be doing?

430
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,390
- Let's rest a bit, Yeon Soo.
- What?

431
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,530
How long has it been
since you played with Chan Hee?

432
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,290
Yes, we should work hard
while the fans are there.

433
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:52,820
If our lives fall apart
while we do it, we won't last long.

434
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,680
Let's take our time
with the third album and rest a little.

435
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,440
I'm saying you should rest
and take a vacation.

436
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,500
I'm not saying you should
go clubbing every night.

437
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,520
I told you I quit.
Why are you saying that?

438
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
- I'm trusting you.
- Okay.

439
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,640
Also...

440
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,280
For the third album...

441
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,340
Jae Hoon will no longer be with us.

442
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,680
- What?
- What?

443
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,830
What?

444
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,500
Jae Hoon, why don't you explain?

445
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,890
Are you in on something
with the President?

446
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:35,030
Why would you leave?

447
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,870
I want to study now.

448
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:41,130
You see? Geu Rin has poisoned the waters.

449
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,130
Why is everyone leaving to study?

450
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,360
It's time for me to choose now.

451
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,470
I promised to keep up my grades
while doing Entertainer Band.

452
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,290
Now that we've become so busy,
my grades are a mess.

453
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,430
Then quit school like I did.
I was very resolute.

454
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,000
I got to do something I liked a lot.

455
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,810
Now, I want to give my mom her life back.

456
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,600
Did you discuss it with your mother?

457
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,910
No, she doesn't know yet.

458
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,350
She'll be very happy.

459
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,660
I'm sorry I couldn't stay until the end.

460
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,650
I'll join the fan club.

461
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,400
Then who will be on drums
for our third album?

462
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,860
We'll get a new drummer.

463
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,960
I can't play guitar
if the drummer isn't right.

464
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,140
There he goes again.

465
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,750
I'm just saying that I wish Jae Hoon
didn't have to leave.

466
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm disappointed.

467
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,640
But, let's respect Jae Hoon's decision.

468
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,490
Then our last event with Jae Hoon
will be the Shanghai fan meeting?

469
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,830
One more thing.

470
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,350
The Asian Award show
will be held in Seoul this year.

471
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,910
We've been nominated for an award.

472
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,450
Wow!

473
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,570
Really?

474
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,970
- Wow!
- That's so awesome.

475
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,840
The Asian Award ceremony will be our
last event for our second album.

476
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,060
If we win the award,
I will speak on our behalf.

477
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,660
You can't do that.
I'm leaving so I should...

478
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,150
I said we were nominated.
I didn't say that we won it.

479
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,910
Who do you take after
to be so over the top?

480
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,430
We take after you, President Shin!

481
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,550
Yeah right!

482
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:26,574

483
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,880
A studio apartment
in a commercial building.

484
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,810
All the places near your school
are rented out.

485
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,880
Is it okay if it's a bit further out?

486
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,890
Show me anything on the subway line.

487
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,840
I'm mad at you.

488
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,480
I hear Jo Ha Neul is doing a drama.

489
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,720
Why did you ask to see me?

490
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,590
I heard you don't have a female lead yet.

491
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,020
Are you kidding me?

492
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,330
If I had Jo Ha Neul, I would have
no problem finding actresses.

493
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,430
The male lead is not
the issue for you, Director.

494
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,080
You need cast a good female lead first.

495
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,410
Don't you think I know that?

496
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,790
All the actresses in this country
are saying no.

497
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,110
You know that I really love you, right?

498
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,290
I don't know that at all.

499
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,330
The female lead needs to be an actress
who has nothing left to lose.

500
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,020
Actresses who have commercial deals

501
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,220
are too soft to do
a film as intense as yours.

502
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,580
- Then should I forget about it?
- Why should you?

503
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,440
You'll go to Cannes if you just make it.

504
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:35,550
You know this so well.
How come actresses don't know?

505
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,770
Dangerous... it's a dangerous character.

506
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,990
That character is someone
who has only one path to survive.

507
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,640
The actress needs to attack it
as if there is no tomorrow.

508
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,010
Yeah, so who is that?

509
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,540
An evil character who
the entire world is mad at.

510
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,990
What do you think of Lee Ji Young?

511
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,370
Lee Ji Young... what!

512
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,570
That crazy girl who tried to destroy
Jin Woo and Jo Ha Neul?

513
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,450
Don't get all worked up
and think about it.

514
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,120
Sit. Sit down.

515
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,440
Just cast Lee Ji Young and
it becomes an issue right away.

516
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,170
Hey, I'm trying to make a movie
not create an issue.

517
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,420
The director is important.

518
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,040
Even Venice has acknowledged you,
so just cast Lee Ji Young.

519
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,790
That character and Pork and Rice Soup
are one hundred percent in sync.

520
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,540
What more does she have to lose?

521
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,950
Her life is like a movie already.

522
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,130
Her method acting
will come out naturally.

523
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,100
Lee Ji Young...

524
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,770
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

525
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:35,430
Your movie theme is "dangerous woman".

526
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,910
That's true. Dangerous woman.

527
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,520
Dangerous woman, Lee Ji Young.

528
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,640
Oh, it's hot. So hot.

529
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,170
Hey, what's for lunch today?

530
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,080
Should we have vegetables
wrapped in lettuce?

531
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,440
We should eat some meat.
Why are you always feeding us grass?

532
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,490
Right, Ji Young?

533
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,800
I think you like meat.
I don't really like it.

534
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,630
You and I are just aren't
on the same wavelength.

535
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,680
Is Kyung Soo going to be late today?

536
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,350
He's going to eat dinner
at his friend's house.

537
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,670
That kid never studies
and he's always playing.

538
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,990
Hello?

539
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,080
Hello, this is Shin Suk Ho.

540
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,110
- Who?
- Ha Neul's manager, Shin Suk Ho.

541
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,650
Yes, what is this about?

542
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,600
Is Ji Young doing well?

543
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,530
Okay, I will ask her about it.

544
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,050
I'll discuss it with Ji Young.

545
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,520
I gave the director your number.

546
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,670
Talk it over.

547
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,310
The director will call you
and you can discuss it with him.

548
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,810
Yes, yes.

549
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,990
By the way...

550
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,990
thank you for thinking of my daughter.

551
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,470
There's no need to thank me.

552
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,150
This could be Ji Young's last chance.

553
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,360
Give her courage
so that she isn't afraid.

554
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,090
Yes.

555
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,730
Bye.

556
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,070
Do you want to meet him?

557
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,390
Don't bother if you're not up for it.

558
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,130
We're looking into
a nail shop in town too.

559
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,190
Living quietly like this is nice too.

560
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,340
Will you stay by my side?

561
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,880
Ji Young.

562
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,590
No matter where you go...

563
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,570
your dad will always be by your side.

564
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,390
So, don't be scared,
and do whatever you want.

565
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,990
Ah, the weather is great.

566
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,990
Where is the veterinary science
department?

567
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,970
There are so many buildings.

568
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:15,040
Excuse me. How do I get
to the veterinary science building.

569
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,590
Oh, it's a bit complicated.

570
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,390
Do you see that red brick building?

571
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,930
If you turn right there,
there's an ATM machine.

572
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:29,350
There's a split in the road there.

573
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,730
Don't go to the left but keep going up
and you'll see a white building.

574
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,300
It's the building on the very end.

575
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,850
Oh, okay. Thank you.

576
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,380
Oh, wait.

577
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,640
What did she say again? ATM...

578
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:18,664

579
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,420
I'm going to the building next to it.
Can you drive me?

580
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,990
The uphill is a hard walk.

581
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,590
Get in.

582
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,740
Thank you.

583
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,720
I'm sorry, but can you tell me
the directions again.

584
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,750
Go straight, for now.

585
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,530
Straight? Okay.

586
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,630
Thank you.

587
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,650
No, thank you.

588
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,440
Oh my gosh! It's Jo Ha Neul.

589
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,380
My phone, my phone.
Take a picture. Hurry!

590
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,040
Ha Neul, Ha Neul!

591
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,010
Did you come to pick up your sister?

592
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,870
- Sister?
- Ha Neul?

593
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,120
You didn't have to work today?

594
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,420
You didn't have to!

595
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,480
Why are you shouting right in my face?

596
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm just upset I don't have a megaphone.

597
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,570
Did you eat lunch? I'll buy you lunch.

598
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,670
Geu Rin, can we have lunch with you?

599
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,600
Oh, but my little brother is here.

600
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,110
He's your little brother?

601
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,730
Did I not mention it?

602
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,430
Hello.

603
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,140
I'm very close to Geu Rin.

604
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,090
- Me too.
- Me too.

605
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,150
Hello.

606
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,020
This is my little brother, Ha Neul.

607
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,130
- Should we go eat?
- It's Ha Neul.

608
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,140
Should we go eat? What should we eat?

609
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,850
Huh? What should we eat?

610
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,110
Get in.

611
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,840
Gosh.

612
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,560
Are you that happy?

613
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,600
You saw how everyone
was pretending to be my friend, right?

614
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,120
Now, the news needs to spread and
my school life will be much better.

615
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,560
Look at the things I do for you.

616
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,220
My little brother is the best.

617
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,120
You showed up at school
to help me out.

618
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,030
I'll treat you to a movie. Let's go.

619
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,300
I can't. I have to go
to the rehearsal studio.

620
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,720
The new drummer is coming today.

621
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,180
Kyle wants to practice
in order to get the basics down.

622
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,250
He's really funny.

623
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,890
So, the drummer
to replace Jae Hoon is coming.

624
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,410
I want to go see too.

625
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,090
All right.

626
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:21,560
How exciting.

627
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,880
You said there weren't any
pretty girls at your school.

628
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,970
There aren't any. You saw them.

629
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,320
I'm the best of the bunch, right?

630
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,210
I don't know about that.
I think I saw one.

631
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,790
Let's open the window
so everyone can see you.

632
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,960
Come on!

633
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,430
Everyone, Ha Neul is here.

634
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,560
What are you doing? Enough already.

635
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,470
Kyle, what are you doing?

636
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,230
There is ranking system.

637
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:58,430
The new drummer is
the rookie of our group.

638
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,470
We need to put him in his place
right from the beginning.

639
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,150
That's how the third album activities
will be peaceful.

640
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,950
Do you think this is the army?
What are you talking about?

641
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,250
We should make it comfortable.

642
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,920
- No...
- That's what I'm saying.

643
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
I am a little worried though.

644
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,930
Kyle will have a hard time playing
if the drummer isn't as good as I am.

645
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,710
So, you should just do it.

646
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:20,220
Just thinking about Entertainer Band
without you makes me sad.

647
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,040
I think I have tears in my eyes.

648
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,840
We should've chosen a new guitarist,
not a drummer.

649
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,550
Geu Rin, aren't you going to the library?

650
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:33,860
Can you even give the puppies
a proper shot if you study so little?

651
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,320
I can give you a shot.
A shot for rabies.

652
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,930
What? Try it then.
Give me a shot right here.

653
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:42,600
- Oh, hello.
- Hi guys.

654
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,030
Oh, what are you doing here,
Jung Geu Rin?

655
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,240
A new member is starting
so I had to be here.

656
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,890
Of course, she is the former manager
of Entertainer Band.

657
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,080
Master songwriters
are on a different level.

658
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,520
You kids...

659
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,360
Is this how you greet
the master songwriter

660
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:01,180
who made your second album a hit?

661
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,430
I told you to say the words
every time you see me.

662
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,100
Victory to Pinky Toe!

663
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,520
Victory!

664
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,250
The nicest kid is leaving. I'm so sad.

665
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,080
Just keep playing drums.

666
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,500
- Where are you?
- Here.

667
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,440
What about the drummer?

668
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,360
Yes, come in!

669
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,630
Oh my! Welcome. Hello there.

670
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,850
Hello there. They call me Pinky Toe.

671
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,410
I'm the best songwriter in Korea.

672
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,100
- Hello.
- Hi.

673
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,500
Aren't her arms too thin?

674
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,330
I don't know if she'll play well.

675
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:08,070
President, you didn't only choose
from a video, did you?

676
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,150
Play for us, Soo Hyun.

677
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,890
I will play now.

678
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,920
Bravo!

679
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,980
President, we should release
the third album. Let's go!

680
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,440
Kyle, what were you saying before?

681
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,080
Didn't you say Entertainer Band
without Jae Hoon had no meaning?

682
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,250
Jae Hoon has to go study.

683
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,730
Thanks for the ride before.

684
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,650
Oh, you knew who I was?

685
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,340
A hat and sunglasses
can't hide your handsome face.

686
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:20,420
I'm Ha Neul's older sister. Hi.

687
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,990
Oh, hi. I'll work hard.

688
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,670
All right.

689
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,130
Aunt Min Joo!

690
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,290
Oh! Chan Hee.

691
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,810
- Aunt Min Joo!
- Yes.

692
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,460
It's been too long, Chan Hee.

693
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,030
I missed you, Aunt Min Joo.

694
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,370
Really? I really missed you too,
Chan Hee.

695
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,170
What brings you here?

696
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:34,570
I thought everyone went out
because there's a new drummer.

697
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:39,440
Everyone went out,
but you weren't there, so we came here.

698
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,500
Oh, I'm very touched.

699
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,530
Aunt Min Joo, Dad bought me this.

700
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:48,410
Wow, that is so cool.
Your dad's the best.

701
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,630
I heard that the new drummer
is very beautiful.

702
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,360
Everyone must be excited.

703
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,010
She is a pretty girl
and plays the drums well.

704
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,150
How pretty is she?

705
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,230
She's just... you are much prettier.

706
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,110
- Why do you keep doing that?
- What?

707
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,770
You shouldn't say things like that
so carelessly to women.

708
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:16,740
When girls your age hear it, they think
it's the beginning of something.

709
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,550
Really? Then I wish I could
start something.

710
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,550
Is there someone you like?

711
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,110
There is. There really is.

712
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:28,830
Who is it? Is it someone I know?

713
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,270
- Yes.
- Really?

714
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,130
Geu Rin is with Suk Ho,
so who could it be?

715
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,710
- The new drummer?
- No.

716
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,870
Then who else do I know?

717
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,270
Remember what I said to you
a long time ago?

718
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,880
Love is straightforward.

719
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:51,360
Yes, I remember.

720
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,460
So, I want to be straightforward
like a fastball.

721
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:56,380
That's really cool of you.

722
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,880
I... like you.

723
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,500
What?

724
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,220
If you ask me when I started
to like you, I don't really know.

725
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,640
At first, I just thought
you were a really cool woman.

726
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,220
Maybe that was why
you were always on my mind.

727
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,800
Yeon Soo, I...

728
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,500
Someone once told me

729
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,290
once you confess your feelings
to someone, they are no longer yours.

730
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,980
The rest is up to the person
who received that confession.

731
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:38,520
I once said that if you're in love,
it's not possible to hold that in.

732
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,900
You remember that, right?

733
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,400
I felt that I didn't deserve you.

734
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,590
So, I was going to keep
my feelings to myself.

735
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,400
But...

736
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,870
even though I know
that I'm lacking, this is love.

737
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,870
I can't hold it in.

738
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,670
I really like you.

739
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,610
Yeon Soo, I'm 35 years old.

740
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,520
You're 26.

741
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,240
We're nine years apart in age, so why?

742
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,920
Every day, I counted
the difference in our ages.

743
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,480
Thankfully, there is still one finger
left when I count with both hands.

744
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,730
I know I'm not the best catch.

745
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:31,880
You are beautiful and talented.

746
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,740
You're the daughter of a billionaire.

747
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,880
I'm young and I have a son.

748
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,470
On top of that...
you found out about my first love.

749
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,520
You found out about my first love too.

750
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:48,480
Thank you for thinking of me
in that way, but...

751
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,440
I'm not asking you to do anything now.

752
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,360
The one thing I have going for me
is that I am young.

753
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,460
I know I can wait.

754
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,820
I've told you how I feel,
so I'm going to sleep well tonight.

755
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,510
Then am I going to have trouble
sleeping from now on?

756
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,710
I have to think this over?

757
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,140
Don't think about it for too long.

758
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,420
If you don't sleep well,
you'll get wrinkles.

759
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:15,960
What?

760
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:20,610
Aunt Min Joo!

761
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,070
Chan Hee! Did it fly?

762
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,370
Did it fly like this?

763
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,910
Gosh, really...

764
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:51,580
Mister, you can't put that there.

765
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,600
- This is Kim's Ramen, right?
- Yes.

766
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,570
- This was delivered to me?
- Yes.

00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,340

00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,610
<i>Thank you, Suk Ho.</i>

772
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,520
Make lots of money, Kim Joo Han.

773
00:53:38,544 --> 00:53:50,544

774
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,110
It's raining. It's raining!

775
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,020
Was it supposed to rain today?

776
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,770
- Do you have an umbrella?
- No.

777
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:05,080
What should we do?

778
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,900
- I'm running for it.
- Geu Rin.

779
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,200
President.

780
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,380
Check the weather, would you?

781
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,160
Let's go.

782
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:33,960
You still have this umbrella.

783
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,730
It doesn't break.

784
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,750
You came just in case
I got rained on, didn't you?

785
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,000
No, I was just walking by.

786
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,730
Did you read "Daddy Long Legs"?

787
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,040
No, I don't like
sentimental books like that.

788
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,130
How would you know it's sentimental
if you didn't read it?

789
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,250
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

790
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,080
Soo Hyun, you'll be
on the red carpet next time.

791
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,950
You must be disappointed this time.

792
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,900
I'm just starting out now.

793
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:19,090
They looked so good in their tuxedos.

794
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:21,060
They are all good looking kids.

795
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:24,310
No, Ha Neul looked the most handsome.

796
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:26,830
I'm letting you know one more time.
I'm Ha Neul's older sister.

797
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,360
That's why we should be close, Sis.

798
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,020
Shouldn't the agency handle matters
when members have relationships?

799
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,010
What is Suk Ho doing?

800
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:39,180
It's just youth.

801
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,210
There is no hesitation in youth.

802
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,400
Kids these days are too straightforward
and come at you like a fastball.

803
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,580
Straightforward?

804
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,040
I like fastballs.

805
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,990
I like baseball too.

806
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,440
Let's be really elegant out there.

807
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,820
Jae Hoon, this is your farewell.
Enjoy yourself.

808
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:00,370
I've even prepared an acceptance speech.

809
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,900
Hey, I said I would do that!

810
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,930
Just don't fall on the red carpet
from nerves.

811
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,530
Kyle is the most in danger of that.

812
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,750
Your dad's so cool!

813
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,770
Let's go.

814
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,630
Woo!

815
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,160
What are you doing? Go.

816
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,170
Just go.

817
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,910
Go in. Inside!

818
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,670
You guys are idiots.

00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,210
I don't want see it.

Hello, my name is Sung Yuri.

- Yes.

It hurts.

Were you not going to invite me?

841
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,690

- Really?

842
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,650
Eat lots, okay?
