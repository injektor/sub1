187
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:04,974

188
00:13:04,975 --> 00:13:06,810
caused by the victim's negligence.

This is from the security footage.

190
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:11,065
As you can see, the victim, Mr. Jung, is drinking something.

191
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:14,341
He puts it back into his backpack and starts walking.

192
00:13:14,855 --> 00:13:16,684
The police stated that they found...

193
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:20,255
a plastic soju bottle among the victim's belongings.

it looks like he just had 2 to 3 sips.

But judging from the amount of soju left in his backpack,

248

277
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,644

Not only was there a lack of a safety system,

321

323

Then what's on your mind?

324
00:23:06,704 --> 00:23:09,602
An organic solvent. There was a detergent he used often.

325
00:23:09,644 --> 00:23:11,943
It's isopropyl alcohol. Ruled out.

326
00:23:11,944 --> 00:23:13,084
That was an assumption.

327
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:15,014
It might be another type of detergent.

328
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:17,383
Okay. We need to rule out the fact that he drank first.

329
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:19,084
But how? The whole nation...

330
00:23:19,085 --> 00:23:21,329

You can't even drink much. What did you drink for?

332
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:30,583
What? Are you saying you're a grown-up now?

333
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:35,504
He can't drink.

334
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:37,774
He was born with a lack of enzymes that can break down alcohol.

335
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:40,325
There's no way he would drink soju before going to work.

336
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,310
There's no way to prove that.

337
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:43,544

one day, I'll make it an important matter.

Bit by bit. Darn it, when will I get it done?

353
00:24:18,985 --> 00:24:21,183

to check for the nephrotoxic substance, n-Hexane.

358
00:24:33,594 --> 00:24:36,064

00:24:44,035 --> 00:24:46,014
We need proof first.

364
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,998
Yes, Chief.

365
00:25:13,835 --> 00:25:16,274
We'll investigate the cause thoroughly, sir.

366
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:17,967
Okay, thank you.

367
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:21,643
What about Huh Min Ki? Why isn't he coming?

368
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:22,838
Is he running late again?

369
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:26,843
- Yes? - Mr. Huh. Where are you?

370
00:25:26,844 --> 00:25:28,784
I'm staking out in front of the police station.

371
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:30,383
You're just making an excuse for being late...

372
00:25:30,384 --> 00:25:32,923
Look for the water bottle. You won't find it.

373
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:35,183
- I'll see you later. - Hey!

00:25:41,864 --> 00:25:43,464
This is Seo Jae Yeong of Crime Team 2.

376
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:45,127
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:47,363
I must've called the wrong number.

378
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:48,904
I'm sorry.

379
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:52,403

This is Ha Rang's ER record.

382
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,218
Multiple skin lesions all over his body.

383
00:25:58,614 --> 00:26:00,883
This isn't enough to determine what it is.

384
00:26:00,884 --> 00:26:03,129
We must carry out an autopsy.

385
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:04,636
Ms. Doh.

386
00:26:05,354 --> 00:26:07,284
I have the results.

387
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:10,007
We found a tiny bit of organic solvent.

388
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,923
Goodness, this isn't enough to prove he was poisoned.

389
00:26:13,924 --> 00:26:15,353
It's going to be tough.

390
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,992
Of course.

391
00:26:17,634 --> 00:26:20,004
He can't be poisoned just by being exposed at the warehouse.

392
00:26:20,005 --> 00:26:21,834
There must be another way he got exposed.

393
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:23,574
I'm just checking whether it was there or not.

394
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,889
Okay, fine.

00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:29,143

There's no water bottle.

403
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:51,193
They probably took it out. I'm certain.

404
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,304
Hey, do you know how difficult it was to take this case?

405
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:54,304
We don't even have proof.

406
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,504
How can we say they hid the evidence?

407
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,136
They really did hide it.

408
00:26:59,604 --> 00:27:01,440
Hey, are you okay?

409
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:03,814
Yesterday, I was really...

410
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:05,274
Goodness.

411
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:07,523
You worried me sick.

412
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,768
I'm all right.

413
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,453
But what's your issue with that TL bodyguard?

414
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:13,362
It seemed like he knew you.

415
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:16,578
Is it a secret?

416
00:27:16,654 --> 00:27:19,193
Wait. Let's talk about that next time.

417
00:27:19,194 --> 00:27:20,623
What do you mean, they hid it?

418
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:23,294
I saw it with my own two eyes.

419
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:25,130
There was a water bottle inside his backpack.

420
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:27,542
My goodness.

421
00:27:29,904 --> 00:27:31,474
Really? Did you take a picture?

422
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:34,804
If I did, it would already be on the news by now.

423
00:27:34,805 --> 00:27:36,544
Are you sure? You really saw it?

424
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,574
I'm sure, I'm telling you. Wait.

425
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,399
Are you working with us now or is this a temporary thing?

426
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,484
What do you think? Of course, she's working with us.

427
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:48,748
Goodness. The police have fabricated evidence.

428
00:27:48,755 --> 00:27:50,560
What can we do now?

429
00:27:53,094 --> 00:27:54,216
Why...

430
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,433
do you think I was staking out?

431
00:27:57,434 --> 00:28:01,163
I mean, there was a rookie officer at the police station...

432
00:28:01,164 --> 00:28:02,673
named Seo Jae Yeong.

433
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,403
These type of guys are really determined...

434
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:06,443
and if we just make up an excuse and give him a slight nudge,

435
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:08,587
he'll talk about the water bottle.

436
00:28:09,015 --> 00:28:11,113
But will he meet with us?

437
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,943
He won't.

438
00:28:12,944 --> 00:28:16,814
That's why you have to go to the Police Hospital by 9am tomorrow...

439
00:28:16,815 --> 00:28:19,100
and provide orthopedic treatment for outpatients.

440
00:28:20,424 --> 00:28:23,024
It turns out he hurt his arm.

441
00:28:23,025 --> 00:28:25,524
Since he's a cop, he'll go to the Police Hospital.

442
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,217
Finding out the schedule for outpatients...

443
00:28:28,594 --> 00:28:29,663
is a piece of cake.

444
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,868
Hey, don't stare at him. He's showing off again.

445
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,227
That's because I'm really good.

446
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:39,074
They copied the medical records on the day of the accident.

447
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:40,304
The corpse is stored safely.

448
00:28:40,305 --> 00:28:42,244
Did you get rid of all his blood and urine?

449
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,613
- Yes. - Then let's stick to the plan.

450
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,175
Call Hanil SD.

451
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,538
Yes, sir.

452
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:05,587
Yes, Chairman Choi.

453
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:08,203
Yes, don't worry.

454
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,927
If the public opinion keeps turning against us,

455
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:13,202
I will get rid of the metro.

456
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:16,206
We should cut off any risks.

457
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:22,322
Yes, sir.

458
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:25,699
Ms. Doh. I think TL has already pulled strings to stop the autopsy.

459
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:27,766
Ha Rang's mother isn't answering the phone either.

460
00:29:28,262 --> 00:29:30,711
Can you please persuade her?

461
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:32,873
Okay, I will.

462
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:46,603
Ma'am.

463
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,255
I have something to tell you.

464
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:52,178
You can stop now.

465
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,578
You've done enough.

466
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,397
I should hold...

467
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,810
a funeral for my son now and send him off.

468
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:07,264
We must carry out an autopsy.

469
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,635
Ma'am.

470
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:15,498
Stop it.

471
00:30:17,613 --> 00:30:20,029
We'll investigate a bit further.

472
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,681
If we can just do an autopsy...

473
00:30:21,682 --> 00:30:26,181
I told you to stop!

474
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,438
I lost my child.

475
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:33,570
Just stop it already! Stop!

476
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,992
Do you even know how my son died?

477
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:41,107
But I'm sitting here...

478
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,046
eating when I'm hungry...

479
00:30:44,372 --> 00:30:46,382
and sleeping when I get sleepy.

480
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:51,938
I've thought about dying hundreds of times.

481
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,181
Ma'am.

482
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,713
Just go.

483
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,048
(Soju)

484
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,309
Please don't say anything to my mom.

485
00:32:31,443 --> 00:32:34,370
She'll just nag me more.

486
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,613
Ha Rang!

487
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:02,964
Ha Rang.

488
00:33:03,743 --> 00:33:05,344
How did you die?

489
00:33:05,952 --> 00:33:07,881
Do Young, why haven't I heard from you yet?

490
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:09,616
Did you have a fight?

491
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:22,291
There were a few people on the platform,

492
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,402
but no one saw the moment of the accident.

493
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:27,227
There is one person who might have witnessed it.

494
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:30,171
The yellow shirt. He's holding a camera.

495
00:33:30,172 --> 00:33:32,487
Was the light on the camera flashing?

496
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:35,272
The light was on. It recorded something.

497
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:36,915
I have to find that young man.

498
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,132
Ms. Byun, please do me a favor.

499
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,663
I need you to find someone for me.

500
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,265
Listen to my voice.

501

(Police Hospital)

504
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,681
Where do I get my medicine?

505
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:21,609
Go downstairs to the first floor and get it there.

506
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,982
Thank you.

507
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,722
Mr. Seo Jae Yeong?

508
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,791
This is just a simple survey.

509
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,262
It will be very helpful...

510
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:39,301
to the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Department...

511
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,871
and their research on officers with posttraumatic stress disorder.

512
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,331
(Where is the water bottle?)

513
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:44,971
Ta-da!

514
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,651
We're from the UDC.

515
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:53,255
I don't know what you're talking about.

516
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,851
You guys announced that he was drunk...

517
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:57,790
to close the case early.

518
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:01,191
I saw what was in his bag at the emergency room.

519
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:05,171
I saw he had a water bottle, and I even took pictures.

520
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:12,871
But I don't think this will end with mere criticism.

521
00:36:12,872 --> 00:36:15,728
I know you're having issues with the prosecution.

522
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:20,597
I'll call the senior executives. You can talk with them.

523
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:23,908
Mr. Seo.

524
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:26,217
Put down your phone.

525
00:36:30,953 --> 00:36:32,044
Hey!

526
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,001
Mr. Seo.

527
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:46,272
Any patient who comes to the ER has to have their blood tested.

528
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,132
Ha Rang's blood didn't have a drop of alcohol in it.

529
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,871
I'm sure the senior executives would have thought...

530
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:55,565
it had been disposed since it was at TL Medical Center.

531
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:59,851
But doctors and medical science...

532
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,464
are true to the rules and principles.

533
00:37:02,752 --> 00:37:03,844
All right?

534
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,513
Wherever you go,

535
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,022
there will always be that one old-fashioned jerk...

536
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:11,184
who wants to go by the rules.

537
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:14,814
(TL Pathology Department, Kim Byung Hyun)

538
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,951
Hello, Byung Hyun? It's me.

539
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:22,754
Do you have Ha Rang's blood sample?

540
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,801
Please have it sent to the UDC...

541
00:37:24,802 --> 00:37:27,118
as soon as the results come out.

we have blood samples that can prove he wasn't drinking.

544
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:37,244
Then it must have been water that Ha Rang drank, right?

545
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:41,315
(Detective Kim In Seok)

546
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:45,892
Hey, you jerk.

547
00:37:45,893 --> 00:37:48,362
Ha Rang was even younger than you.

548
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:50,341
You hid the evidence of that kid.

549
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:53,635
If this gets exposed, you'll have to take responsibility, you know.

550
00:37:55,003 --> 00:37:58,573
Do you think they're going to help you out?

551
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:00,771
They'll ignore you.

552
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:07,673
Let's go.

553
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:10,817
You coward.

554
00:38:13,393 --> 00:38:14,473
The chief's...

555
00:38:18,493 --> 00:38:19,686
drawer.

556
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:33,940
(Exhibit 16)

557
00:38:35,312 --> 00:38:38,200
I guess people make mistakes.

558
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:39,551
Sure.

559
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:43,327
We're all human, so we make mistakes and lie, too.

560
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:45,806
Have a good day.

561
00:38:47,523 --> 00:38:50,276
I guess he's had too much fine dust in his system.

562
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,091
So, him being drunk has been completely ruled out...

563
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,162
and he was staggering due to exposure to an organic solvent?

564
00:38:57,163 --> 00:38:59,872
It was n-Hexane. It's a neurotoxic substance...

565
00:38:59,873 --> 00:39:02,902
which crippled 5 Thai workers 10 years ago.

566
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:04,372
I thought they stopped using it two years ago?

567
00:39:04,373 --> 00:39:06,941
They're still using it illegally.

568
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:08,512
Even the slightest exposure to it every day...

569
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,112
can cause nerve damage, myasthenia,

570
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:11,841
and even blisters on your skin.

571
00:39:11,842 --> 00:39:13,282
It's the same as Ha Rang's symptoms.

572
00:39:13,283 --> 00:39:15,451
Okay. Let's continue on when you get here.

573
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:16,544
Yes, ma'am.

574
00:39:17,952 --> 00:39:19,727
Did you see what I did?

575
00:39:20,123 --> 00:39:23,461
There are only three things you need in this country to succeed.

576
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,921
The money, the style, and the talk.

577
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:27,932
From what I can tell,

578
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,916
you've got the talk.

579
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:38,289
The cleaning solution Ha Rang had...

580
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:40,772
is a harmless IPA.

581
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:42,446
It doesn't include n-Hexane.

582
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:46,034
That's just too bad

583
00:39:46,653 --> 00:39:48,551
That's just too bad

584
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,867
What Doh Joong Eun said...

585
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,765
was wrong

586
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,362
From now on,

587
00:39:57,363 --> 00:39:59,434

588
00:40:01,493 --> 00:40:02,758
Myasthenia in the leg.

589
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:05,930
Chronic cough.

590
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,196

591
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:12,063
This...

592
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:14,849
must be mercury poisoning!

593
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,433
Mercury...

594
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,644
But then again...

595
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:24,051
the mercury poisoning case of Mun Song Myeon...

596
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:26,602
that happened during the 1988 Seoul Olympics,

597
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:28,691
and now,

598
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,492
we have just finished the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.

599
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:33,328
- So why... - Hey!

600
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:34,732
Stop fooling around.

601
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,002
Focus on your work! Mercury, my foot!

602
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:39,431
I was working. Don't you see this?

603
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:42,471
I've been checking each pixel...

604
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:44,801
that my eyes could fall out.

605
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:45,822
Look.

606
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:48,041
They hid the water bottle...

607
00:40:48,042 --> 00:40:50,430
and accused him of being drunk. Right?

608
00:40:50,842 --> 00:40:53,944
That means it has something to do with it,

609
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,652
but I don't know what.

610
00:40:56,653 --> 00:40:57,775
Mr. Huh.

611
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:00,120
Zoom in on this.

612
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:01,274
Where?

613
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,554
- Here? - Yes.

614
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:05,984
No, not there.

615
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:09,723
Here!

616
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,891
- Hey, it's a dual label. - Gosh.

617
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,272
- Let us in! - It is a dual label.

618
00:41:20,273 --> 00:41:22,558
- You can't do that! - It was covering n-Hexane.

619
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:23,982
- The thing is though, - What do you want?

620
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:25,412
it's completely empty now.

621
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:26,840
I think they disposed of the whole thing.

622
00:41:27,353 --> 00:41:30,178
I see. Thank you for your help, sir. All right.

623
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,489
We just need that container, then.

624
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,878
It can serve as firm evidence.

625
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,543
No, it can't. All of this is just circumstantial evidence.

626
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,428
There's no concrete evidence.

627
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:44,362
If they actually used n-Hexane, we just need to find solid evidence.

628
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:46,821
Darn it. Hey, show me that thing again.

629
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:49,322
Let's see.

630
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,563

What are you talking about?

639
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,953
Please answer my question. Did you drink the soju?

640
00:42:45,592 --> 00:42:47,632
No, I can't drink.

641
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,046
Okay, thank you. I'll be in touch.

642
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,258

- We got it. - Where is it?

648

- Really? Seriously? - Let me see.

This is the kind of firm evidence I was talking about.

650
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,373
It was found on the wooden chopsticks too.

651
00:43:31,572 --> 00:43:33,571
Ms. Doh was right.

652
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:34,940
Seriously? n-Hexane?

653
00:43:36,243 --> 00:43:38,581
- How did you know? - There was a half-empty soju box...

654
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:40,512
in the trash can at Ha Rang's place.

655
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:41,752
Once, I also saw him...

656
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:43,486
with a plastic soju bottle when I ran into him.

657
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,181
A soju box and a plastic soju bottle.

658
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:46,951
It's unlikely that he drank both.

659
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,177
He drank one,

660
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:50,671
and the other one had detergent inside.

661
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:53,821
But why was the detergent stored in a soju bottle?

662
00:43:54,033 --> 00:43:56,001
I'm sure he knew it's against the law to use it.

663
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:59,053
Then what if the company puts the blame on Ha Rang?

664
00:43:59,133 --> 00:44:01,275
They won't be able to because they switched the labels.

665
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:04,763
They're guilty of deliberately letting the employees use it.

666
00:44:04,972 --> 00:44:06,442
Right, the label. Okay.

667
00:44:06,613 --> 00:44:08,441
n-Hexane cleans well, you know.

668
00:44:08,442 --> 00:44:09,941
Since Ha Rang was the youngest on the team,

669
00:44:09,942 --> 00:44:12,054
I bet they gave him the stations where things break most often.

670
00:44:12,243 --> 00:44:14,152
The strong detergent must've made...

671
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:16,181
his job easier because wiping just once would've been enough.

672
00:44:16,182 --> 00:44:17,482
It was found on his utensils as well.

673
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:18,551
It means he ate it too.

674
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:20,821
That must've drastically increased the amount he was exposed to.

675
00:44:20,822 --> 00:44:22,691
- Exactly. Mr. Ha. - Yes, ma'am.

676
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:24,561

677
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,561

00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,043
Tae Young.

723
00:47:11,222 --> 00:47:13,681
You can't fix people.

724
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:17,354
Have some tea.

725
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:32,747
We just worked hard. I didn't do anything wrong.

726
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,784
- Ms. Gong. - Yes?

727
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,539
Listen to Ha Rang's final words before he died.

728
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:42,453
His co-worker must've recorded the call.

729
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,543
Seriously?

730
00:47:50,163 --> 00:47:52,407
That's the only thing people like us can do to survive.

731
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,499
We have to make this public.

732
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:58,108
Without this, no one will even be interested in this issue.

733
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:01,812
We must fight with science and data as our weapons.

734
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,199
You said we should change the system.

735
00:48:04,012 --> 00:48:05,441
We can't change the system...

736
00:48:05,442 --> 00:48:07,798
by measuring a substance and analyzing data.

737
00:48:07,913 --> 00:48:10,751
Even if those jerks went over the maximum permitted amount...

738
00:48:10,752 --> 00:48:11,976
of whatever substance they used,

739
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:16,265
do you think we can change anything by pointing that out?

740
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:18,814
No, we can't.

741
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,094
For us to make change happen,

742
00:48:21,462 --> 00:48:24,186
we need public sentiment and support on our side.

743
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,884
Ha Rang is the third victim.

744
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:30,585
The cup noodles...

745
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:34,167
and the spoon in his backpack.

746
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:39,508
He was only 19.

747
00:48:40,353 --> 00:48:41,434
Darn it.

748
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:47,982
The words that the 19-year-old guy left for us.

749
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:51,036
This is the truth.

750
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:55,431
Right, I guess I was too emotional.

751
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,830
Then let's take a reasonable approach.

752
00:48:58,462 --> 00:48:59,585
I'm on board.

753
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:03,723
Me too.

754
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:12,765
Gosh.

755
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:16,772
Are we good now?

756
00:49:20,653 --> 00:49:23,579
I don't even know anymore. You can send it to the media.

757
00:49:24,123 --> 00:49:25,550
Don't mention the UDC though.

758
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:30,856
Whatever.

759
00:49:32,232 --> 00:49:33,396
I'm definitely mentioning it.

760
00:49:36,032 --> 00:49:38,501
We received a file containing a recording...

761
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:40,042
of the last phone conversation that Mr. Jeong,

762
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,441
the victim of the screen door accident,

763
00:49:42,442 --> 00:49:44,043
had before his death.

764
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,797
Let's hear it right away.

765
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:51,108
Do Young, don't get angry and just hear me out.

766
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:54,613
The company...

767
00:49:55,722 --> 00:49:56,845
won't change.

768
00:49:57,863 --> 00:49:59,015
Hey, you're back.

769
00:49:59,793 --> 00:50:01,495
They'll only change after a few people die.

770
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,795
If both of us...

771
00:50:09,732 --> 00:50:10,997
die on the job,

772
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,799
will things change a little?

773
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:25,568
So just get out of the labor union.

774
00:50:27,353 --> 00:50:29,565
The world won't change even if you keep protesting.

775
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:32,792
Let's just work hard.

776
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:35,343
(My friend, it wasn't your fault.)

777
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,276
That's the only thing people like us can do to survive.

778
00:50:49,272 --> 00:50:50,334
Sir!

779
00:50:50,883 --> 00:50:52,514
Ha Rang and I joined the company together.

780
00:50:53,143 --> 00:50:55,082
He wanted to work hard and live a good life, but he died.

781
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:56,510
All he did was do what he was told.

782
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:59,876
Hence, we will no longer do as we're told.

783
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:02,334
Why? Because we don't want to die!

784
00:51:03,863 --> 00:51:06,617
Don't touch me! Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

785
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:10,021
I'm human too, and I want to live.

786
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,342
I don't want to die!

787
00:51:12,732 --> 00:51:13,793
I don't...

788
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,971
Why are you pushing her? You should be ashamed.

789
00:51:17,972 --> 00:51:21,716
You jerks! How could you let a young kid just die like that?

790
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,670
(USB device connected)

791
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:29,377
(When will I become happy? My poor life)

792
00:52:58,442 --> 00:52:59,626
Ma'am.

793
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,688
I knew about it roughly.

794
00:53:08,982 --> 00:53:10,380
That my son...

795
00:53:10,823 --> 00:53:12,894
wasn't working at an office.

796
00:53:13,992 --> 00:53:16,166
That he was doing something tough.

797
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,812
He was a pretty quiet boy...

798
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:25,754
and didn't talk about himself often.

799
00:53:27,073 --> 00:53:29,654
But once, he told me what was on his mind.

800
00:53:31,043 --> 00:53:33,572
What are you doing? Why are you looking in my wallet?

801
00:53:33,573 --> 00:53:35,011
Why?

802
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:37,681
Is there a picture of your girlfriend in there or something?

803
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:39,314
No, of course not.

804
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,082
- Mom. - What?

805
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,979
Can I quit work?

806
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:45,607
Why? Is it too tough?

807
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,877
Come on. There's no easy job in this world.

808
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:53,071
Still, there's no reason to do something so exhausting.

809
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,126
Son.

810
00:53:57,532 --> 00:54:00,832
No matter how hard it is, you have to endure it.

811
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,771
You'll get used to it soon.

812
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:06,572
If you quit because it's too hard, you'll eventually quit again later.

813
00:54:06,573 --> 00:54:09,194
Then you won't be able to do anything.

814
00:54:10,482 --> 00:54:11,533
Okay.

815
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,063
What?

816
00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,757
- Fine, I won't quit. - What?

817
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,382
- What? - All right.

818
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:20,592
- What? - Fine, I'll keep working.

819
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:22,751
I'll keep working. I'll really try my best.

820
00:54:22,752 --> 00:54:24,092
- I'll work hard. - Really?

821
00:54:24,093 --> 00:54:26,122
All right. I won't quit. Stop it.

822
00:54:26,123 --> 00:54:27,832
Stop it, Mom!

823
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:29,628
Stop tickling me!

824
00:54:36,532 --> 00:54:37,766
Why did I...

825
00:54:39,172 --> 00:54:42,303
think of my debt at that moment?

826
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:45,892
When my son was in so much stress.

827
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,434
So...

828
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:51,951
I told him to just endure it and keep working.

829
00:54:51,952 --> 00:54:54,267
I told him there was no easy job in this world...

830
00:54:54,323 --> 00:54:56,721
and that he should try his best when he had the chance.

831
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:58,497
That he'd get used to it soon.

832
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,084
So...

833
00:55:02,163 --> 00:55:04,783
I was the one who told him not to quit.

834
00:55:07,532 --> 00:55:08,624
Me.

835
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:20,082
I was really crazy.

836
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,852
I lost my mind.

837
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:23,652
I didn't even know...

838
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,897
how hard his job was...

839
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:28,936
I was crazy.

840
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:36,332
I was crazy.

841
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,270
I lost my mind.

842
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,193
Ma'am.

843
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:51,880
I can't agree to an autopsy.

844
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:53,944
After you left,

845
00:55:54,182 --> 00:55:56,662
I thought it would be the right thing to do,

846
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,569
but I just can't agree to it.

847
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,621
Ms. Doh.

848
00:56:02,053 --> 00:56:03,352
I'm sorry.

849
00:56:03,353 --> 00:56:05,921
This is all my fault.

850
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:09,062
All I can think of is my dead son.

851
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:11,409
This is all my fault.

852
00:56:13,563 --> 00:56:16,184
I heard they found the cause of his accident.

853
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:18,889
Isn't that enough?

854
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:21,103
I've never...

855
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:24,043
made him any nice food...

856
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:28,065
or bought him nice clothes.

857
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:32,888
He lived such a hard life and had to leave like that.

858
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:36,552
Just let me send him...

859
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:38,838
Please let me send him off in peace.

860
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:42,832
I'm begging you, Ms. Doh.

861
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,464
Okay, ma'am.

862
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,869
I'm sorry.

863
00:56:51,143 --> 00:56:52,673
I'm sorry.

864
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:56,211
My son.

865
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:58,630
My baby, Ha Rang.

866
00:56:58,712 --> 00:57:01,100
It's all my fault...

867
00:57:01,883 --> 00:57:03,993
My son...

868
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:06,623
My son, Ha Rang...

869
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:50,987
Three years ago,

870
00:57:51,262 --> 00:57:53,632
we saw another Ha Rang.

871
00:57:53,633 --> 00:57:56,332
Yesterday afternoon at Line 2 Guui Station of Seoul Subway,

872
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:59,842
20-year-old Mr. Kim, who was repairing the screen door,

873
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,872
got stuck between the door and the train and died.

874
00:58:02,873 --> 00:58:05,781
He risked his life to repair the screen door on his own...

875
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:09,251
and this 19-year-old man met his death alone.

876
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:10,481
(The late Mr. Kim)

877
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:12,122
He lived harder than anyone,

878
00:58:12,123 --> 00:58:14,491
but being branded as a temporary worker for a subcontractor...

879
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,021
crushed the bright youth of this 19-year-old man...

880
00:58:17,022 --> 00:58:20,185
and the lives of his family that he left behind.

881
00:58:21,393 --> 00:58:23,332
He could barely eat a cup of noodles...

882
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,461
let alone a proper meal.

883
00:58:25,462 --> 00:58:29,716
His last day was a few hours before his birthday.

884
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:32,572
If he was alive for seven more hours,

885
00:58:32,573 --> 00:58:34,711
he would have been 20 years old.

886
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,582
But instead of congratulating him, we had to send our condolences.

887
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,912
We still remember that day from three years ago.

888
00:58:40,913 --> 00:58:43,352
The screen door will open.

889
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,521
These doors were made for the safety of our citizens,

890
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,072
but became a door of death in reality.

891
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:50,921
The safety we enjoyed...

892
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:53,778
was actually guaranteed by someone else's life.

893
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:56,231
If the safety of everyone isn't guaranteed,

894
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:58,854
that means that no one is safe.

895
00:58:59,762 --> 00:59:03,431
We learned that through Mr. Kim's accident.

896
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:05,171
It's not your fault.

897
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:06,601
You are right!

898
00:59:06,772 --> 00:59:09,471
Not only are we outsourcing dangerous work, but in reality,

899
00:59:09,472 --> 00:59:12,582
there's a saying that we're actually outsourcing death.

900
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,082
We want to tell all the laborers that passed away...

901
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,123
that it wasn't their fault.

902
00:59:17,252 --> 00:59:19,322
We hope he knew that...

903
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:23,521
his death at the job site was never his fault.

904
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,622
(I want to live in a safe country where I won't die at work.)

905
00:59:24,623 --> 00:59:26,092
We call him...

906
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:29,627
Mr. Kim of Guui Station.
