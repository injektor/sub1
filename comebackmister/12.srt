1
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:09,538
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing there?</font>

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,670
<font color="yellow">Do you remember what I said about my sister?</font>

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,900
<font color="yellow">She cried so much as a baby...</font>

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,700
<font color="yellow">so I used to call her a crybaby.</font>

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,900
<font color="yellow">Every time I called her a crybaby,</font>

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,470
<font color="yellow">she used to cry even more. I found that cute...</font>

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,270
<font color="yellow">so I always made fun of her for it.</font>

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,240
<font color="yellow">I found out where she lives.</font>

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,470
<font color="yellow">My sister.</font>

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,870
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,570
<font color="yellow">Where does she live?</font>

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,850
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak.</font>

14
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,340
<font color="yellow">I'm your brother-in-law from now on.</font>

15
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,340
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
<font color="yellow">that Da Hye is...</font>

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,670
<font color="yellow">Han Hong Nan.</font>

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,000
<font color="yellow">Her real name is...</font>

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,440
<font color="yellow">Han Hong Nan.</font>

20
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,770
<font color="yellow">Although we'll never call her by that name.</font>

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,670
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

22
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,170
<font color="yellow">What kind of a sad fate is this?</font>

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,770
<font color="yellow">Now I know...</font>

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,770
<font color="yellow">why we had to return...</font>

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,170
<font color="yellow">together.</font>

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,700
<font color="yellow">And why...</font>

27
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,440
<font color="yellow">I came back in a woman's body.</font>

28
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,570
<font color="yellow">Now I know.</font>

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,540
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan, why don't you join us already?</font>

30
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,123
<font color="yellow">Sir, here we meet again.</font>

31
00:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,870
<font color="yellow">Hello, welcome.</font>

32
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,340
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,140
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

34
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,170
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan, try this.</font>

35
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,170
<font color="yellow">(Heemang Orphanage)</font>

36
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,940
<font color="yellow">Now that your mother's passed away, how do you plan to raise her?</font>

37
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,643
<font color="yellow">If you don't want her to live within thugs, send her to us.</font>

38
00:03:07,643 --> 00:03:09,400
<font color="yellow">Don't even think twice.</font>

39
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,470
<font color="yellow">Once she gets adopted overseas, she'll meet nice foster parents...</font>

40
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,343
<font color="yellow">and won't even want to come back to Korea.</font>

41
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:18,740
<font color="yellow">Where are we going?</font>

42
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,470
<font color="yellow">Why are you about to cry again?</font>

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,570
<font color="yellow">People will call you a crybaby if you start crying.</font>

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,450
<font color="yellow">If someone harasses you, what do you do?</font>

45
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,470
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

46
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,940
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

47
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,240
<font color="yellow">That's my sister.</font>

48
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,770
<font color="yellow">Are we going off to see Mum?</font>

49
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,340
<font color="yellow">Look. There's a car.</font>

50
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,600
<font color="yellow">Should we take a picture in front of it?</font>

51
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,170
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

52
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,810
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

53
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,100
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3!</font>

54
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,970
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan.</font>

55
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,700
<font color="yellow">Why are you staring at me?</font>

56
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,600
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

57
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,653
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

58
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:27,370
<font color="yellow">You should have come earlier. We're almost done eating.</font>

59
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,470
<font color="yellow">I should have.</font>

60
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,100
<font color="yellow">I came too late.</font>

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,563
<font color="yellow">- Give me some.
- Open your mouth.</font>

62
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:40,600
<font color="yellow">Open.</font>

63
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,200
<font color="yellow">This one's good.</font>

64
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,100
<font color="yellow">Do you want more?</font>

65
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,633
<font color="yellow">Hey, you should try some meat.</font>

66
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:53,670
<font color="yellow">It's quite good.</font>

67
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,500
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

68
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,040
<font color="yellow">I was getting hungry.</font>

69
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,470
<font color="yellow">It's tasty.</font>

70
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,163
<font color="yellow">- Is it tasty?
- Yes.</font>

71
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:07,270
<font color="yellow">It's because I cooked it.</font>

72
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,870
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it. I can do it.</font>

73
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,700
<font color="yellow">I always wanted to do this.</font>

74
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,270
<font color="yellow">Acting like a family.</font>

75
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,740
<font color="yellow">How many siblings do you have?</font>

76
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,100
<font color="yellow">I have an older brother.</font>

77
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:30,770
<font color="yellow">He used to...</font>

78
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,900
<font color="yellow">call me a crybaby. That's my brother.</font>

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,400
<font color="yellow">I envy you. You feel protected when you have an older brother.</font>

80
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,540
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

81
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,970
<font color="yellow">Crybaby.</font>

82
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,250
<font color="yellow">Sir, you should rest inside.</font>

83
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,070
<font color="yellow">Sure. We shouldn't have a guest cleaning up after us.</font>

84
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,560
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,394
<font color="yellow">She wants to get to know Da Hye.</font>

86
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:02,600
<font color="yellow">Okay, very well.</font>

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,940
<font color="yellow">Da Hye does need a friend.</font>

88
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,100
<font color="yellow">Da Hye, how were you as a child?</font>

89
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,500
<font color="yellow">Did you have a happy childhood?</font>

90
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,470
<font color="yellow">I think I was happy.</font>

91
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

92
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,970
<font color="yellow">I don't remember my childhood.</font>

93
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,670
<font color="yellow">I had an accident when I was about Han Na's age.</font>

94
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,870
<font color="yellow">I don't remember clearly, but I think I was...</font>

95
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,070
<font color="yellow">running around to find my dad or brother.</font>

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,670
<font color="yellow">Then I got hit by a truck.</font>

97
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,270
<font color="yellow">My current mum hit me.</font>

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,363
<font color="yellow">She lied to the hospital saying that I was her daughter...</font>

99
00:06:56,363 --> 00:06:59,270
<font color="yellow">because of the insurance benefit.</font>

100
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,900
<font color="yellow">You can guess what happened, can't you?</font>

101
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,670
<font color="yellow">Since then I grew up delivering meals at a market.</font>

102
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,650
<font color="yellow">This is strange. I've never told this story...</font>

103
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,870
<font color="yellow">to people other than Young Soo.</font>

104
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,800
<font color="yellow">I guess I feel comfortable around you.</font>

105
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,940
<font color="yellow">Han Na, can I ask you something?</font>

106
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,970
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
<font color="yellow">Did your mum say anything to you...</font>

108
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,070
<font color="yellow">when your dad wasn't around?</font>

109
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,670
<font color="yellow">About having a hard time...</font>

110
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,963
<font color="yellow">or having a secret she couldn't tell.</font>

111
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:23,770
<font color="yellow">If I tell it, then it's not a secret.</font>

112
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,240
<font color="yellow">Right. That's true.</font>

113
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,270
<font color="yellow">There's nobody without a secret.</font>

114
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,670
<font color="yellow">Even I have one.</font>

115
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,970
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I have to do homework.</font>

116
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,464
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to help you?</font>

117
00:08:39,464 --> 00:08:42,240
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay. I can do it by myself.</font>

118
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,240
<font color="yellow">I'll leave you to it then.</font>

120
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,540
<font color="yellow">We need to talk. Can I come see you now?</font>

121
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,270
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd come right away.</font>

122
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,170
<font color="yellow">Is this what you meant by doing what Da Hye wants the most?</font>

123
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,870
<font color="yellow">A long time ago, I promised her that I'd find her family.</font>

124
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,410
<font color="yellow">I finally kept that promise.</font>

125
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,670
<font color="yellow">Stop trying to use Han Gi Tak.</font>

126
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,170
<font color="yellow">And leave Da Hye.</font>

127
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,570
<font color="yellow">Kim Young Soo.</font>

128
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,470
<font color="yellow">What had he been doing...</font>

129
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,770
<font color="yellow">as her husband?</font>

130
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,770
<font color="yellow">How could he not know...</font>

131
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,470
<font color="yellow">what you know?</font>

132
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,070
<font color="yellow">It was her choice.</font>

133
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,570
<font color="yellow">I went back to give her the gloves and picture after we parted.</font>

134
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,670
<font color="yellow">She told me to throw them out.</font>

135
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,270
<font color="yellow">She said she had Kim Young Soo, a new family.</font>

136
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,040
<font color="yellow">He had such huge responsibilities,</font>

137
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,470
<font color="yellow">but he neglected his duties.</font>

138
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,770
<font color="yellow">Kim Young Soo did.</font>

139
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,870
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan, did something happen today?</font>

140
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,970
<font color="yellow">Do you want to try punching my hands?</font>

141
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,170
<font color="yellow">I think that'll make me cheer up.</font>

142
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,770
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

143
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,800
<font color="yellow">Tightly clench your fists and...</font>

144
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,670
<font color="yellow">punch my hands. One, two.</font>

145
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,770
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

146
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,070
<font color="yellow">My brother taught me...</font>

147
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,370
<font color="yellow">never to be weak wherever I was.</font>

148
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,540
<font color="yellow">You introduced her to Gi Tak's pub.</font>

149
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,770
<font color="yellow">Did you already know then?</font>

150
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,140
<font color="yellow">I wanted Da Hye to meet her brother casually.</font>

151
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,900
<font color="yellow">It was difficult for me to tell her.</font>

152
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,070
<font color="yellow">But Young Soo took her...</font>

153
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,800
<font color="yellow">He took her to a funeral and made her do chores.</font>

154
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,700
<font color="yellow">He broke his promise again...</font>

155
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,800
<font color="yellow">the next day.</font>

156
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,660
<font color="yellow">I got so angry. I went there to tell her that...</font>

157
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,570
<font color="yellow">she had a real family beside Young Soo.</font>

158
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,470
<font color="yellow">I couldn't, though.</font>

159
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,800
<font color="yellow">She was left there alone...</font>

160
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,433
<font color="yellow">and Young Soo died.</font>

161
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,494
<font color="yellow">Da Hye got hurt too much...</font>

162
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:08,570
<font color="yellow">because of that.</font>

163
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

164
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,270
<font color="yellow">Will you tell her...</font>

165
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,897
<font color="yellow">about Gi Tak?</font>

166
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,670
<font color="yellow">I wasn't going to tell her...</font>

167
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,170
<font color="yellow">since she lost her husband and her brother.</font>

168
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,470
<font color="yellow">So I thought I was the only one to protect Da Hye...</font>

169
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,297
<font color="yellow">before you came along.</font>

170
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,300
<font color="yellow">Jung Ji Hoon.</font>

171
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,300
<font color="yellow">Young Soo must be grateful.</font>

172
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,900
<font color="yellow">Since you found Da Hye's family.</font>

173
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,270
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

174
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
<font color="yellow">don't tell her.</font>

175
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,800
<font color="yellow">Let's not make her cry again.</font>

176
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,800
<font color="yellow">Losing Young Soo was enough.</font>

177
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,670
<font color="yellow">That's interesting.</font>

178
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,770
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan said differently.</font>

179
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,240
<font color="yellow">I am Gi Tak's real sister.</font>

180
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,870
<font color="yellow">Don't tell her.</font>

181
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,440
<font color="yellow">You'll make the wrong person get hurt.</font>

182
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,770
<font color="yellow">Or was she saying the same thing?</font>

183
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,870
<font color="yellow">Anyway, don't make Da Hye get hurt.</font>

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,870
<font color="yellow">I will protect her.</font>

185
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,440
<font color="yellow">Where did Mr Lee go?</font>

186
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,870
<font color="yellow">Did he go to bed?</font>

187
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,140
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'll see him again.</font>

188
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,970
<font color="yellow">For once.</font>

189
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,970
<font color="yellow">Can...</font>

190
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,900
<font color="yellow">I give you a hug?</font>

191
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,240
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

192
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,763
<font color="yellow">Who told you to die so soon?</font>

193
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,394
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

194
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:35,563
<font color="yellow">You had an untimely death.</font>

195
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:36,770
<font color="yellow">You idiot.</font>

196
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,763
<font color="yellow">Who told you to die from working excessively?</font>

197
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,033
<font color="yellow">Are you proud of dying at the age of 40 because of work?</font>

198
00:15:41,033 --> 00:15:43,960
<font color="yellow">If you left her, you should be alive at least.</font>

199
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,463
<font color="yellow">Why did you make her become an orphan, you jerk?</font>

200
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:47,540
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

201
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,320
<font color="yellow">- Why you...
- You jerk.</font>

202
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,394
<font color="yellow">What? Did I say something wrong?</font>

203
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,233
<font color="yellow">What if it was with thugs?</font>

204
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,563
<font color="yellow">You should've raised her.</font>

205
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave her? Tell me why!</font>

206
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,260
<font color="yellow">You jerk.</font>

207
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,494
<font color="yellow">You promised to make her happy. You should've kept the promise.</font>

208
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:09,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you make her even lonelier?</font>

209
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,067
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill you.</font>

210
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:13,860
<font color="yellow">- Got it?
- I'm already dead.</font>

211
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,370
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just cease to exist?</font>

212
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,463
<font color="yellow">- Take this!
- Die!</font>

213
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,567
<font color="yellow">Die!</font>

214
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,870
<font color="yellow">- You jerk.
- Take that.</font>

215
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,763
<font color="yellow">- Shoot.
- You jerk.</font>

216
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:26,687
<font color="yellow">What do you take me for?</font>

217
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,933
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

218
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:31,494
<font color="yellow">- Let go.
- Look at you.</font>

219
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:32,940
<font color="yellow">You said you wouldn't. Let go.</font>

220
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,670
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

221
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,070
<font color="yellow">Did you think I'd fall for it twice?</font>

222
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,660
<font color="yellow">- You jerk.
- You need a beating.</font>

223
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,294
<font color="yellow">- Do you think I can't do it?
- You jerk.</font>

224
00:16:48,294 --> 00:16:49,500
<font color="yellow">You need a beating.</font>

225
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

226
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,400
<font color="yellow">Where did you go...</font>

227
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,300
<font color="yellow">after creating the mess?</font>

228
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,670
<font color="yellow">Did you get into a fight?</font>

229
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,610
<font color="yellow">Your face...</font>

230
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,040
<font color="yellow">How did you fall on your face without even drinking?</font>

231
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,040
<font color="yellow">My legs are too long, so they got tangled.</font>

232
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,070
<font color="yellow">You're so silly.</font>

233
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,970
<font color="yellow">You're the one who is hurting the most.</font>

234
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,400
<font color="yellow">Once again, I'm the one receiving.</font>

235
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,970
<font color="yellow">All done.</font>

236
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,340
<font color="yellow">Put some more on, please.</font>

237
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,040
<font color="yellow">It hurts a lot.</font>

238
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,970
<font color="yellow">Don't tell Yi Yeon.</font>

239
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,670
<font color="yellow">It was just a little squabble.</font>

240
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,270
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was there anyway?</font>

241
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,570
<font color="yellow">Did you follow me in case I stayed out all night again?</font>

242
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,470
<font color="yellow">You're Han Gi Tak's sister?</font>

243
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,170
<font color="yellow">You're lying, Hong Nan.</font>

244
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,970
<font color="yellow">I trust you.</font>

245
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,470
<font color="yellow">Trust me. I'll stay home.</font>

246
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,610
<font color="yellow">Yi...</font>

247
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,070
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon.</font>

248
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,500
<font color="yellow">This punk ripped them real good.</font>

249
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,770
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

250
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,940
<font color="yellow">These are your brother's only photos.</font>

251
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
<font color="yellow">- Was it Cha Jae Gook's doing?
- Well.</font>

252
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,370
<font color="yellow">I left home a while ago. It would be weird if he didn't know.</font>

253
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,400
<font color="yellow">As long as he doesn't know you're Gi Tak's sister, it's fine.</font>

254
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,770
<font color="yellow">You must have been frightened.</font>

255
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,800
<font color="yellow">It's fine. This is fine.</font>

256
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,700
<font color="yellow">He swore he'd never let me go.</font>

257
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,540
<font color="yellow">I don't know...</font>

258
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,070
<font color="yellow">when it will ever end.</font>

259
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,970
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

260
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,967
<font color="yellow">One, two.</font>

261
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,070
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

262
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,040
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

263
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,300
<font color="yellow">I wonder just how many scary dreams...</font>

264
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,870
<font color="yellow">you would have had all by yourself.</font>

265
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,970
<font color="yellow">Your brother had something scary happen today, too.</font>

266
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,870
<font color="yellow">For us, nothing is more frightening...</font>

267
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,970
<font color="yellow">than you not remembering.</font>

268
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,340
<font color="yellow">Leave a little place in your memory for me.</font>

269
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,260
<font color="yellow">And fill the rest...</font>

270
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,340
<font color="yellow">with happy and nice memories.</font>

271
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,500
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

272
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,400
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

273
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,170
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep.</font>

274
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,700
<font color="yellow">Are you thinking about Gi Tak?</font>

275
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,670
<font color="yellow">I love these pictures.</font>

276
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,300
<font color="yellow">I can feel...</font>

277
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,300
<font color="yellow">the life that he led...</font>

278
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,070
<font color="yellow">that I couldn't see for myself.</font>

279
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,270
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he thought it was for the best.</font>

280
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,170
<font color="yellow">But when you think about it,</font>

281
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,370
<font color="yellow">it was a cruddy life.</font>

282
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he didn't know...</font>

283
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,370
<font color="yellow">that doing something for someone...</font>

284
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,400
<font color="yellow">may hurt them the most.</font>

285
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,970
<font color="yellow">That idiot.</font>

286
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,340
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

287
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,240
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just drunk.</font>

288
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for drinking alone.</font>

289
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,400
<font color="yellow">Let it slide just this once.</font>

290
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,770
<font color="yellow">I'm happy I got to know a little more about you.</font>

291
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,670
<font color="yellow">Hello, my brother-in-law.</font>

292
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,860
<font color="yellow">Is your face okay?</font>

293
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,660
<font color="yellow">And are you okay?</font>

294
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,670
<font color="yellow">Call me "Brother", won't you?</font>

295
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,570
<font color="yellow">- Brother?
- Yes.</font>

296
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,800
<font color="yellow">How pretty was my little sister this morning?</font>

297
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:49,140
<font color="yellow">All the flowers at the store wilted in her presence.</font>

298
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,363
<font color="yellow">Those flowers won't come back to life.</font>

299
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:53,270
<font color="yellow">Our family genes are quite superior.</font>

300
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,570
<font color="yellow">I didn't know your real sister's name was Hong Nan.</font>

301
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,433
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

302
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,170
<font color="yellow">If she were alive somewhere...</font>

303
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,770
<font color="yellow">If we could meet again...</font>

304
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,400
<font color="yellow">I wanted her to look back...</font>

305
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,470
<font color="yellow">if she heard her own name.</font>

306
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,140
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan. Han Hong Nan.</font>

307
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,560
<font color="yellow">She looked. She looked.</font>

308
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,670
<font color="yellow">She looked.</font>

309
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,940
<font color="yellow">I'll call you when I'm done.</font>

310
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,970
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

311
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,270
<font color="yellow">You startled me.</font>

312
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,377
<font color="yellow">Mr Ma. It's been a while.</font>

313
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:45,387
<font color="yellow">Did you miss me?</font>

314
00:25:45,387 --> 00:25:46,500
<font color="yellow">I was bored.</font>

315
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,800
<font color="yellow">Like I wanted to chew on something, but had nothing to chew on.</font>

316
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,770
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the vacation.</font>

317
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,967
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,</font>

318
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:01,370
<font color="yellow">my family was able to spend a great time in the Philippines.</font>

319
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,940
<font color="yellow">It was the first time since I started working here.</font>

320
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,270
<font color="yellow">I'm glad. Submit the receipts.</font>

321
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,670
<font color="yellow">The company will pay for the family outing.</font>

322
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,170
<font color="yellow">You do mean it?</font>

323
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,560
<font color="yellow">I don't say things I don't mean.</font>

324
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,570
<font color="yellow">Just a minute.</font>

325
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,130
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

326
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,400
<font color="yellow">I am looking for your wings.</font>

327
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,600
<font color="yellow">I thought you must be an angel.</font>

328
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,770
<font color="yellow">You're not entirely wrong.</font>

329
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,240
<font color="yellow">You're the first man...</font>

330
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
<font color="yellow">to shake my heart.</font>

331
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,240
<font color="yellow">The first...</font>

332
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,090
<font color="yellow">Even the sky is wishing you a successful photo shoot.</font>

333
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,600
<font color="yellow">What a great weather!</font>

334
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,470
<font color="yellow">I knew this day would come.</font>

335
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,447
<font color="yellow">Why isn't anyone here?</font>

336
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:58,770
<font color="yellow">Have we come too early?</font>

337
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,900
<font color="yellow">I'll look into it.</font>

338
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,133
<font color="yellow">What? Why would it get cancelled? Why?</font>

339
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:24,000
<font color="yellow">I don't know why. We were told from the organisers.</font>

340
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,140
<font color="yellow">Look, is this Yi Yeon?</font>

341
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,140
<font color="yellow">You are stunning.</font>

342
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,600
<font color="yellow">What now? You got them for nothing.</font>

343
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,300
<font color="yellow">It was him, wasn't he?</font>

344
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,770
<font color="yellow">His way of doing things never change.</font>

345
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,740
<font color="yellow">I guess robbing my house yesterday...</font>

346
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,933
<font color="yellow">wasn't enough for him, then?</font>

347
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:10,000
<font color="yellow">Come on, that's not enough to dissolve his anger.</font>

348
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,800
<font color="yellow">You live in Gi Tak's house with his sister.</font>

349
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,430
<font color="yellow">Don't get her involved.</font>

350
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,570
<font color="yellow">That would depend entirely on you.</font>

351
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,477
<font color="yellow">You are acting too smart with me. You're trying to fly all over me.</font>

352
00:28:24,477 --> 00:28:25,840
<font color="yellow">You've gone too far.</font>

353
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,370
<font color="yellow">Besides this, you have three more contract cancellations.</font>

354
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,640
<font color="yellow">I can't pay any fees to the contractors.</font>

355
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,000
<font color="yellow">So that means you'll have to pay them yourself.</font>

356
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,570
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

357
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
<font color="yellow">How long do you think you'll be on the rise?</font>

358
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,640
<font color="yellow">You know as well as I do who has you by the collar.</font>

359
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,800
<font color="yellow">Why would you act so arrogant?</font>

360
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,140
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go to Cha Jae Gook...</font>

361
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,140
<font color="yellow">and wag your tail for him?</font>

362
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,600
<font color="yellow">I told you to watch your mouth.</font>

363
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,570
<font color="yellow">I'll bite you for real next time.</font>

364
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,770
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

365
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,223
<font color="yellow">There you go again. Stop acting.</font>

366
00:29:12,223 --> 00:29:13,370
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon!</font>

367
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,900
<font color="yellow">Hey, pretty girl!</font>

368
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,870
<font color="yellow">- Weren't we in this together?
- You're so naive.</font>

369
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,430
<font color="yellow">I don't have any patience.</font>

370
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,970
<font color="yellow">Call me when the pretty girl comes out of the water.</font>

371
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,900
<font color="yellow">Tell her to bring the money.</font>

372
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,640
<font color="yellow">That's my last warning.</font>

373
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,170
<font color="yellow">Song Yi Yeon!</font>

374
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,170
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak.</font>

375
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,700
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon!</font>

376
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,170
<font color="yellow">Open your eyes, Yi Yeon!</font>

377
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,370
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon!</font>

378
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,970
<font color="yellow">Why is there no movement on Yi Yeon's side?</font>

379
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,240
<font color="yellow">It's only normal for her crazy manager to barge in here.</font>

380
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,900
<font color="yellow">Was it Han Hong Nan?</font>

381
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,240
<font color="yellow">How did your meeting with her go?</font>

382
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,100
<font color="yellow">I didn't get much out of her except that she's close to Mr Lee.</font>

383
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,170
<font color="yellow">You haven't gained much.</font>

384
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,584
<font color="yellow">What have you done for me recently?</font>

385
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,970
<font color="yellow">Shin Da Hye hasn't signed the agreement paper either.</font>

386
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,140
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

387
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,070
<font color="yellow">I don't like too many things in this world.</font>

388
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,740
<font color="yellow">Don't disappoint me.</font>

389
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
<font color="yellow">Ms Song fell in the water due to an accident in the dock...</font>

390
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,740
<font color="yellow">but her manager saved her.</font>

391
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,870
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak's...</font>

392
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,640
<font color="yellow">sister.</font>

393
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,040
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon.</font>

394
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,170
<font color="yellow">You grew a thick skin.</font>

395
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,500
<font color="yellow">You are not crying after being insulted.</font>

396
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
<font color="yellow">That's my girl.</font>

397
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,140
<font color="yellow">I can do it.</font>

398
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,870
<font color="yellow">I saw Gi Tak in the water.</font>

399
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,370
<font color="yellow">I must have been close to death.</font>

400
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,470
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

401
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,040
<font color="yellow">I was happy seeing him nonetheless.</font>

402
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,233
<font color="yellow">You keep talking about Gi Tak!</font>

403
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:49,470
<font color="yellow">Look what happened to you because of that punk. Aren't you fed up?</font>

404
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,170
<font color="yellow">What is he to you?</font>

405
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,900
<font color="yellow">Do you know why that punk abandoned me?</font>

406
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,540
<font color="yellow">He couldn't let me live with the thugs.</font>

407
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,040
<font color="yellow">He said he won't look for me if I died...</font>

408
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,226
<font color="yellow">and not to look for him once he died. He betrayed me.</font>

409
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:07,870
<font color="yellow">He's a coward and a jerk.</font>

410
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,650
<font color="yellow">- Hong Nan.
- You said...</font>

411
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,770
<font color="yellow">you ruined his life, right?</font>

412
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,070
<font color="yellow">Don't be mistaken.</font>

413
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,800
<font color="yellow">10 years ago,</font>

414
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,370
<font color="yellow">he brought you in front of Jae Gook.</font>

415
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,157
<font color="yellow">He's the one who called your manager!</font>

416
00:34:24,157 --> 00:34:27,370
<font color="yellow">So forget about that coward!</font>

417
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,900
<font color="yellow">How can we end this?</font>

418
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,070
<font color="yellow">What do I have to do...</font>

419
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,870
<font color="yellow">to end...</font>

420
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,010
<font color="yellow">this nightmare?</font>

421
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,340
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

422
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,570
<font color="yellow">I found Hong Nan.</font>

423
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,570
<font color="yellow">But after I...</font>

424
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,700
<font color="yellow">I came back here, everything turned into a mess.</font>

425
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,510
<font color="yellow">Mum.</font>

426
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

427
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
<font color="yellow">I'll do it.</font>

428
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,570
<font color="yellow">Let's do it. The modelling contract.</font>

429
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,600
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

430
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:43,470
<font color="yellow">She'll sign the contract. Give me high five.</font>

431
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,640
<font color="yellow">You made the right decision.</font>

432
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,233
<font color="yellow">Sunjin Department Store's model, Song Yi Yeon,</font>

433
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:04,600
<font color="yellow">welcome.</font>

434
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,363
<font color="yellow">Can you carry out the conditions right away?</font>

435
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,294
<font color="yellow">Of course. The modelling fee...</font>

436
00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:17,100
<font color="yellow">will cover the current agency contract cancellation fee.</font>

437
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,700
<font color="yellow">Finally Na Suk Chul will be fired.</font>

438
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,363
<font color="yellow">Until you find a new agency,</font>

439
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:28,594
<font color="yellow">we will take care of your schedule.</font>

440
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,940
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

441
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,840
<font color="yellow">carry out the last condition as well.</font>

442
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,270
<font color="yellow">Ms Han Hong Nan.</font>

443
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,570
<font color="yellow">You are fired from being her manager.</font>

444
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,510
<font color="yellow">It won't cause any harm to reconcile with Yi Yeon.</font>

445
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,170
<font color="yellow">You're right, Sir.</font>

446
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,594
<font color="yellow">It surely is getting positive reviews.</font>

447
00:37:59,594 --> 00:38:01,570
<font color="yellow">That idiot.</font>

448
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,770
<font color="yellow">I basically spoon-fed him, but he couldn't even take it.</font>

449
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:08,294
<font color="yellow">What has Jae Gook been doing?</font>

450
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,470
<font color="yellow">The two have different methods.</font>

451
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,064
<font color="yellow">- Please look at this.
- Our store sells products...</font>

452
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,663
<font color="yellow">Plutocrats' obnoxious behaviours are controversial issues.</font>

453
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:22,694
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee's welfare and love-oriented management policy...</font>

454
00:38:22,694 --> 00:38:25,900
<font color="yellow">went well with what Yi Yeon expected from the department store.</font>

455
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,900
<font color="yellow">We are not obligated to do that.</font>

456
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,270
<font color="yellow">Was Hae Joon...</font>

457
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,894
<font color="yellow">like that?</font>

458
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,940
<font color="yellow">It's a bit different from his previous behaviours.</font>

459
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,240
<font color="yellow">Did you come here to check how I'd look?</font>

460
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,640
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

461
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,840
<font color="yellow">I did give you a chance.</font>

462
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,770
<font color="yellow">Don't think this is the end of it.</font>

463
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,570
<font color="yellow">You said you won't let me go.</font>

464
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,870
<font color="yellow">If making me miserable was what you were after...</font>

465
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,940
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

466
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,170
<font color="yellow">You used the best method.</font>

467
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,970
<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul.</font>

468
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,170
<font color="yellow">You kept that horrible monster by my side.</font>

469
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,740
<font color="yellow">Do you know why I can't forget Gi Tak?</font>

470
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
<font color="yellow">He was the only one...</font>

471
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,170
<font color="yellow">who saved me from that horrible monster.</font>

472
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,370
<font color="yellow">Because of that,</font>

473
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,700
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak ruined his life.</font>

474
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,100
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

475
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,010
<font color="yellow">I'm only trying to have a talk.</font>

476
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,663
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- My friend will be staying with me.</font>

477
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,770
<font color="yellow">You know Hong Nan, don't you?</font>

478
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,533
<font color="yellow">She's been fired. She has nowhere to go.</font>

479
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,133
<font color="yellow">My gosh. How did that happen?</font>

480
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:15,170
<font color="yellow">So please welcome her and treat her nicely.</font>

481
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,940
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

482
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,010
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

483
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,240
<font color="yellow">- What are these?
- I keep getting those.</font>

484
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,270
<font color="yellow">I'm too popular.</font>

485
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,100
<font color="yellow">It's too much for me to handle.</font>

486
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,270
<font color="yellow">Why are you giving these to me?</font>

487
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,840
<font color="yellow">You eat them. Don't give them to Han Na.</font>

488
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,963
<font color="yellow">It's fun to break these.</font>

489
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:42,700
<font color="yellow">It has love messages inside too.</font>

490
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,270
<font color="yellow">I'm not interested.</font>

491
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,470
<font color="yellow">Of course you are.</font>

492
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,510
<font color="yellow">(It's not what we planned. I'll be waiting for your reply.)</font>

493
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,470
<font color="yellow">Wait for my reply?</font>

494
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,340
<font color="yellow">You scared me.</font>

495
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,400
<font color="yellow">What does it say?</font>

496
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,300
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

497
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,700
<font color="yellow">Is this not a love letter?</font>

498
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,510
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

499
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,670
<font color="yellow">My name is Big Head.</font>

500
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,600
<font color="yellow">That's not funny.</font>

501
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,900
<font color="yellow">I'm the Big Head Monster then.</font>

502
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,370
<font color="yellow">It's not funny.</font>

503
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,163
<font color="yellow">- Han Na.
- Yes?</font>

504
00:42:12,163 --> 00:42:15,163
<font color="yellow">Shall I tell you a secret?</font>

505
00:42:15,163 --> 00:42:16,533
<font color="yellow">- A secret?
- But...</font>

506
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,070
<font color="yellow">you have to tell me why you're feeling down.</font>

507
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,493
<font color="yellow">I want to play with you more,</font>

508
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:23,770
<font color="yellow">but I don't have...</font>

509
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,670
<font color="yellow">much time left.</font>

510
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,770
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

511
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,670
<font color="yellow">going somewhere?</font>

512
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,970
<font color="yellow">You tell me first.</font>

513
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,533
<font color="yellow">What's your secret?</font>

514
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:40,100
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

515
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,510
<font color="yellow">I love Han Na very much.</font>

516
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,700
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

517
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,260
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

518
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,533
<font color="yellow">Hi, Han Na.</font>

519
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:06,800
<font color="yellow">- You're home.
- Yes.</font>

520
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,670
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

521
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,133
<font color="yellow">Why are you here without notice?</font>

522
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:15,094
<font color="yellow">I was that close with the family. I would visit...</font>

523
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:16,350
<font color="yellow">without notice.</font>

524
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,010
<font color="yellow">I brought this on myself.</font>

525
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,900
<font color="yellow">Jung Ji Hoon.</font>

526
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,163
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

527
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:37,133
<font color="yellow">Do I need to tell you?</font>

528
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:38,170
<font color="yellow">Did you come here...</font>

529
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,733
<font color="yellow">to tell them about that thing?</font>

530
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:43,594
<font color="yellow">Da Hye and I will...</font>

531
00:43:43,594 --> 00:43:45,663
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. This is all I can serve you.</font>

532
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:47,033
<font color="yellow">- Sir, give it to me.
- What?</font>

533
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,540
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

534
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,763
<font color="yellow">Well, he came uninvited.</font>

535
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:57,970
<font color="yellow">He should've brought his own refreshments.</font>

536
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,500
<font color="yellow">We're family, aren't we?</font>

537
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,384
<font color="yellow">Han Na, did something happen in school that upset you?</font>

538
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:11,540
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

539
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,423
<font color="yellow">Don't pretend you know things.</font>

540
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:16,294
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry? Do you want to go out and eat something yummy?</font>

541
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:18,640
<font color="yellow">- I'm not hungry.
- You know nothing.</font>

542
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,260
<font color="yellow">Is it because you're bored?</font>

543
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,733
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go out and play?</font>

544
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:24,933
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

545
00:44:24,933 --> 00:44:26,733
<font color="yellow">You want to play inside, don't you?</font>

546
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:27,984
<font color="yellow">He's wrong, isn't he?</font>

547
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:29,533
<font color="yellow">Han Na,</font>

548
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,163
<font color="yellow">did you enjoy the concert?</font>

549
00:44:31,163 --> 00:44:33,033
<font color="yellow">Those tickets were hard to get.</font>

550
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:34,900
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how many members there are?</font>

551
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,694
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

552
00:44:37,694 --> 00:44:38,900
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know?</font>

553
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,640
<font color="yellow">How many then?</font>

554
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,294
<font color="yellow">Song Yi Yeon,</font>

555
00:45:37,294 --> 00:45:39,294
<font color="yellow">do you think I don't have a place to go?</font>

556
00:45:39,294 --> 00:45:41,453
<font color="yellow">I have a family too.</font>

557
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:44,040
<font color="yellow">I'm not lonely at all.</font>

558
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,140
<font color="yellow">That's funny.</font>

559
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,500
<font color="yellow">Hey. Chef's assistant, Jegil.</font>

560
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,840
<font color="yellow">Let's have a family meeting.</font>

561
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,470
<font color="yellow">Mummy!</font>

562
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,970
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

563
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,494
<font color="yellow">Father, I'm home.</font>

564
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:35,640
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

565
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,233
<font color="yellow">Da Hye.</font>

566
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:44,100
<font color="yellow">Han Na, I'm going to wash up, so wait in Grandpa's room.</font>

567
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,070
<font color="yellow">Young Soo.</font>

568
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,000
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in here?</font>

569
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:14,840
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

570
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,770
<font color="yellow">Thanks.</font>

571
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,240
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

572
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,240
<font color="yellow">what was that in the box?</font>

573
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,540
<font color="yellow">Something your mum lost some time ago.</font>

574
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you have it?</font>

575
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,670
<font color="yellow">I thought she may look for it some day.</font>

576
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,133
<font color="yellow">Why Lee Hae Joon and not me?</font>

577
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,994
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to hear it.
- Da Hye.</font>

578
00:47:57,994 --> 00:47:59,610
<font color="yellow">Is it because we were together...</font>

579
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,270
<font color="yellow">on the night Young Soo died?</font>

580
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,270
<font color="yellow">Do you like my mum?</font>

581
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:09,100
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

582
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,270
<font color="yellow">I like your mum and your dad,</font>

583
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,000
<font color="yellow">and I like you, too.</font>

584
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,970
<font color="yellow">(Kiwi Banana Juice)</font>

585
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,100
<font color="yellow">Do you get itchy if you eat bananas, too?</font>

586
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,240
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

587
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,640
<font color="yellow">No, right?</font>

588
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,970
<font color="yellow">I don't take after my dad at all.</font>

589
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,370
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be like you.</font>

590
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:51,400
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

591
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:55,000
<font color="yellow">I hate that my dad was as smart as you,</font>

592
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,340
<font color="yellow">and that he was as competitive as you.</font>

593
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,870
<font color="yellow">I hate that my dad liked you.</font>

594
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

595
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,340
<font color="yellow">Are you getting ready for the test?</font>

596
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,870
<font color="yellow">I've been too busy lately to...</font>

597
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,340
<font color="yellow">- But how do you know that?
- Just because Gi Tak is gone,</font>

598
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,063
<font color="yellow">did you stop studying altogether?</font>

599
00:49:30,063 --> 00:49:32,470
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

600
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

601
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:43,140
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak told you to take the exam and go to college.</font>

602
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,840
<font color="yellow">He said not to worry about tuition,</font>

603
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,426
<font color="yellow">but that's gone now.</font>

604
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:51,120
<font color="yellow">- Is that his fault?
- That's not what I mean.</font>

605
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,370
<font color="yellow">That scum, Na Suk Chul.</font>

606
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,363
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

607
00:49:54,363 --> 00:49:56,140
<font color="yellow">He's the one to blame.</font>

608
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,533
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

609
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:00,920
<font color="yellow">Should we attack and reclaim the pub?</font>

610
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,063
<font color="yellow">You punks!</font>

611
00:50:02,063 --> 00:50:04,333
<font color="yellow">Soak your bodies in hot water...</font>

612
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:07,387
<font color="yellow">and draw out that thug nature. Got it?</font>

613
00:50:07,387 --> 00:50:09,163
<font color="yellow">How many times must I say it?</font>

614
00:50:09,163 --> 00:50:12,070
<font color="yellow">Legally! Fair and square!</font>

615
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,970
<font color="yellow">We will reclaim our pub...</font>

616
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,647
<font color="yellow">fair and square.</font>

617
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:18,670
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

618
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,894
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Boss!
- Yes, Boss'... sister.</font>

619

<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

620
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,170
<font color="yellow">let's go see the Big Boss.</font>

621
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,070
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,600
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

623
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,900
<font color="yellow">Get lost.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Your old personality is back.
- What?</font>

625
00:50:53,863 --> 00:50:56,500
<font color="yellow">You were as cold as ice before Hong Nan showed up.</font>

626
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,700
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

627
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,440
<font color="yellow">You changed the most after she came.</font>

628
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,570
<font color="yellow">I... I did not.</font>

629
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,800
<font color="yellow">Will you really not see her again?</font>

630
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,140
<font color="yellow">I really don't want...</font>

631
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,540
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan to become...</font>

632
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,540
<font color="yellow">like Gi Tak.</font>

633
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,770
<font color="yellow">If making me miserable was what you were after...</font>

634
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,970
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

635
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,970
<font color="yellow">You used the best method.</font>

636
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:52,540
<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul.</font>

637
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,270
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

638
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,270
<font color="yellow">I wondered if I'd ever get to see the inside of your office.</font>

639
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,400
<font color="yellow">I'm so honoured to be here.</font>

640
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:17,340
<font color="yellow">But why did you call for me in the middle of the night?</font>

641
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,270
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

642
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,700
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

643
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,140
<font color="yellow">You were so useful when I first met you.</font>

644
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:41,440
<font color="yellow">You are too kind.</font>

645
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,570
<font color="yellow">You knew who Yi Yeon went to 10 years ago,</font>

646
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,600
<font color="yellow">and to whom she'd run to first when the scandal came out.</font>

647
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,240
<font color="yellow">Almost like a fortune teller.</font>

648
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,340
<font color="yellow">I have a radar for things like that.</font>

649
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,940
<font color="yellow">That's how I do what I do.</font>

650
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:06,570
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

651
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,800
<font color="yellow">who did this to you?</font>

652
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,240
<font color="yellow">This?</font>

653
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,540
<font color="yellow">Why do you care about my humble background?</font>

654
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,740
<font color="yellow">Humble background? Still, I want to know.</font>

655
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,640
<font color="yellow">Why? Is it difficult to say because it involves...</font>

656
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:26,500
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon and Gi Tak?</font>

657
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:30,430
<font color="yellow">Sir. That is...</font>

658
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:31,440
<font color="yellow">You rat.</font>

659
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,070
<font color="yellow">How dare you...</font>

660
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:39,500
<font color="yellow">use me?</font>

661
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,170
<font color="yellow">You're mistaken. Please spare me.</font>

662
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,470
<font color="yellow">How dare you covet my woman?</font>

663
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,670
<font color="yellow">How dare you covet something that is mine?</font>

664
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,600
<font color="yellow">Please stop, Sir.</font>

665
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,900
<font color="yellow">No one would care if I kill a rat like you and dump you in the street.</font>

666
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:10,800
<font color="yellow">Shall I try?</font>

667
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:14,940
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

668
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:16,870
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

669
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,400
<font color="yellow">I told you not to eat bananas.</font>

670
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,800
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

671
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,400
<font color="yellow">- Mummy.
- Yes?</font>

672
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:48,770
<font color="yellow">Grandpa, you and dad aren't like this.</font>

673
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,170
<font color="yellow">Why am I the only one?</font>

674
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,540
<font color="yellow">Dad shakes whenever he has carrots.</font>

675
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,300
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

676
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,300
<font color="yellow">All done.</font>

677
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,500
<font color="yellow">I'll call your teacher tomorrow. Take the day off.</font>

678
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,070
<font color="yellow">I'll come home early, too.</font>

679
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight.</font>

680
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,800
<font color="yellow">I miss Daddy,</font>

681
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,240
<font color="yellow">so I'm going to see him.</font>

684
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,740
<font color="yellow">Father, where are you?</font>

685
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,940
<font color="yellow">How about Han Na? Aren't you with her?</font>

686
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,870
<font color="yellow">No. I'm at the senior centre.</font>

687
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,670
<font color="yellow">Why? Is something wrong?</font>

688
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,470
<font color="yellow">No. I'll call you back later.</font>

<font color="yellow">Han Na, please pick up.</font>

692
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,216
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

693
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:38,440
<font color="yellow">How's Han Na?</font>

694
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,757
<font color="yellow">They say seasonal foods are good for allergies.</font>

695
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:43,240
<font color="yellow">So, for dinner...</font>

696
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,840
<font color="yellow">Hello? Are you still there?</font>

697
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,370
<font color="yellow">Are you there?</font>

698
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,640
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? What is it?</font>

699
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:55,840
<font color="yellow">Han Na...</font>

700
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,300
<font color="yellow">Han Na is gone. She isn't answering her phone, either.</font>

701
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,300
<font color="yellow">What? Where are you?</font>

702
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:05,900
<font color="yellow">I'm home.</font>

703
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:10,240
<font color="yellow">I'm home, but she left a note and she's gone.</font>

704
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:14,270
<font color="yellow">Don't move. I'll be right there.</font>

705
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,840
<font color="yellow">Han Na.</font>

706
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,400
<font color="yellow">Why is this...</font>

707
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,700
<font color="yellow">Mummy.</font>

708
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,340
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

709
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:53,740
<font color="yellow">Grandpa, you and dad aren't like this.</font>

710

<font color="yellow">Why am I the only one?</font>

711
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,400
<font color="yellow">What did you tell Han Na yesterday?</font>

712
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,394
<font color="yellow">Da Hye, what do you...</font>

713
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:11,500
<font color="yellow">What did you say to her?</font>

714
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,000
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to her?</font>

715
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,800
<font color="yellow">Han Na, where are you?</font>

716
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,240
<font color="yellow">Daddy's coming.</font>

717
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,070
<font color="yellow">- Yes!
- Yes!</font>

718
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,470
<font color="yellow">- Hold on.
- What's wrong?</font>

719
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,233
<font color="yellow">I don't think this is right.</font>

720
00:59:38,233 --> 00:59:40,840
<font color="yellow">You rat. You want to save it and eat it all by yourself!</font>

721
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,940
<font color="yellow">Give it.</font>

722
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,533
<font color="yellow">It doesn't taste good at all.</font>

723
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:47,630
<font color="yellow">Daddy waited 10 years for Man Bong.</font>

724
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,233
<font color="yellow">Tell him to wait a little longer.</font>

725
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:50,926
<font color="yellow">I'll fly right over.</font>

726
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:52,730
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

727
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,040
<font color="yellow">I love you, got it?</font>

728
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:55,670
<font color="yellow">Man Bong.</font>

729
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,500
<font color="yellow">I need to go to my baby, Man Bong.</font>

730
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,694
<font color="yellow">- No!
- Man Bong!</font>

731
00:59:59,694 --> 01:00:02,070
<font color="yellow">No! Stop!</font>
