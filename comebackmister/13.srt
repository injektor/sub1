Daddy's coming!</font>

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,490
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Honey?</font>

5
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,090
<font color="yellow">- Han Na's missing!
- What?</font>

6
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,620
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Han Na's mom
is freaking out right now.</font>

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,900
<font color="yellow">- Please go to her right away.
- Got it.</font>

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,700
<font color="yellow">I'll head over there right away.</font>

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,300
<font color="yellow">She won't pick up her phone, and none
of her friends know where she is.</font>

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,050
<font color="yellow">Have you called her
school and the police?</font>

11
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,900
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Good job.</font>

12
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,230
<font color="yellow">Above all else though,
you need to calm down.</font>

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,900
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm sure that
our Han Na is just fine.</font>

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,790
<font color="yellow">Ms. Da Hye! I've called my
entire crew. We'll find her soon.</font>

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,900
<font color="yellow">But, um, if she went to
go look for her dad</font>

16
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,490
<font color="yellow">maybe she went to the columbarium?</font>

17
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,100
<font color="yellow">I'll give the security
staff over there a call.</font>

18
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,100
<font color="yellow">All righty! All that's left for you
to do is not worry, and smile.</font>

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,990
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,900
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen her.</font>

21
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,620
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen this girl?
- You're Han Na's friend, right?</font>

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,160
<font color="yellow">If you see her, call me right away.</font>

23
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,340
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

24
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,790

Three of you, that way. Go!</font>

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,580
<font color="yellow">Oh, Father!</font>

28
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,170
<font color="yellow">What's everybody fussing about?</font>

29
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,320
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm sure she's just
hanging out with her friends.</font>

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,320
<font color="yellow">If she wanted to see her dad,
she probably went there.</font>

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,510
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, "there?"</font>

32
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,010
<font color="yellow">I think I know where she might be.</font>

33
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,320
<font color="yellow">- Take me with you.
- I'll find her.</font>

34
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,410

37
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,220
<font color="yellow">I heard that the Branch Manager
told them to change</font>

38
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,510
<font color="yellow">the main billboard to
Song Lee Yeon's photo today.</font>

39
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,010
<font color="yellow">Wow, he's having a grand
old time, isn't he?</font>

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,140
<font color="yellow">Whatever. He has a death wish, defying
me like this. What about the Chairman?</font>

41
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,320
<font color="yellow">Didn't he say that he had an
important meeting today?</font>

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,510
<font color="yellow">He told me that there's
no need for you to join him.</font>

43
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,110
<font color="yellow">You should focus on saving the store.</font>

44
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,220
<font color="yellow">So he doesn't want me to
sit next to him anymore, huh?</font>

45
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,210
<font color="yellow">Did you hear that? Our Branch Manager
beat him and got a contract with Ms. Lee!</font>

46
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,620
<font color="yellow">So the big shot around here
is Branch Manager Lee now!</font>

47
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,010
<font color="yellow">Does this mean that we can finally escape</font>

48
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,420
<font color="yellow">from the pressure from
the higher-ups to raise sales?</font>

49
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,820
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

50
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,820
<font color="yellow">Lee Hae Joon.
He's a real clever one.</font>

51
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,920
<font color="yellow">He really knows how to piss someone off.</font>

52
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,210
<font color="yellow">Does he think that I won't
be able to sell the store</font>

53
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,510
<font color="yellow">if he tacks Song Lee Yeon's
face onto it, or something?</font>

54
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,210
<font color="yellow">Continue with with the selling
of the department store.</font>

55
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,820
<font color="yellow">Buy up all our stock, too.</font>

56
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,210
<font color="yellow">I think Father wants me
to show him just how skilled I am.</font>

57
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,820
<font color="yellow">So it's only fair that I show him.</font>

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,420
<font color="yellow">- Um, yes, sir.
- Oh yeah, about Song Lee Yeon's manager.</font>

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,320
<font color="yellow">That girl named Hong Nan, I mean.</font>

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,710
<font color="yellow">Was there anything strange about her?</font>

61
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,210
<font color="yellow">What do you mean exactly, sir?</font>

62
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,010
<font color="yellow">Why do you think she
is hanging around Song Lee Yeon?</font>

63
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,820
<font color="yellow">It's really getting to me.</font>

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,920
<font color="yellow">Do you have a private
relationship with her, sir?</font>

65
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,210
<font color="yellow">No. Leave.</font>

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,420
<font color="yellow">- Section Chief Gu.
- Yes, sir?</font>

67
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:33,210
<font color="yellow">Bring Na Suk Chul to me.
I need to ask him something.</font>

68
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,710
<font color="yellow">About Han Gi Tak, that is.</font>

69
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:04,120

you can do to help yourself calm down.</font>

71
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,710
<font color="yellow">Pucker your mouth so it
looks like a butthole</font>

72
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,420
<font color="yellow">and make a sound for
a long time, like this.</font>

73
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,320
<font color="yellow">- Are you mad at me?
- No.</font>

74
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,620
<font color="yellow">Did you come here because
you wanted to see your dad?</font>

75
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,920
<font color="yellow">Dad said that we'd come here together.</font>

76
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,210
<font color="yellow">Wow, it looks cool!
Do you want to ride it?</font>

77
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,120
<font color="yellow">Mister. Will I be able to see
Dad if I get closer to the sky?</font>

78
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,660
<font color="yellow">It's been so great lately.</font>

79
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:26,210
<font color="yellow">Mom and Grandpa seem to like you, too</font>

80
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,710
<font color="yellow">even though Dad's not here anymore.</font>

81
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,520
<font color="yellow">If I start to like you, too,
I'll feel so bad for Dad.</font>

82
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,710
<font color="yellow">Because I forgot
about Dad for a little bit.</font>

83
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,210
<font color="yellow">And forgot about being sad.</font>

84
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,610
<font color="yellow">He doesn't even come
visit me in my dreams anymore.</font>

85
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,710
<font color="yellow">There are still so many things
I didn't tell him yet, though.</font>

86
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,210
<font color="yellow">Should we go see Dad, then?</font>

87
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,610
<font color="yellow">- It's so high up!
- Aren't you scared?</font>

88
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,020
<font color="yellow">N-no.</font>

89
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,210
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit scared, though.</font>

90
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,420
<font color="yellow">Your hands are so big like Dad's,
and you smell just like Dad.</font>

91
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,820
<font color="yellow">Really? Maybe it's because
we use the same lotion?</font>

92
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,820
<font color="yellow">Mister... Dad sent you, right?</font>

93
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,920
<font color="yellow">Figures.</font>

94
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,320
<font color="yellow">Han Na. Can you tell me</font>

95
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,520
<font color="yellow">what you wanted to tell your dad?</font>

96
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,820
<font color="yellow">I like you, but you're not Dad.</font>

97
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,210
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

98
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,420
<font color="yellow">- Dad!
- Han Na!</font>

99
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,110
<font color="yellow">Dad! Do you know how much I missed you?</font>

100
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

101
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,020
<font color="yellow">Why did you just leave me behind?
Why did you do that?</font>

102
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry.</font>

103
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,710
<font color="yellow">Dad! I'm sorry that I'm
not your daughter.</font>

104
00:12:53,710 --> 00:13:05,520
<font color="yellow">No. I was so happy to be your dad.</font>

105
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,210
<font color="yellow">Thanks for being my daughter. Okay?</font>

106
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,420
<font color="yellow">Dad! Dad!</font>

107
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,920
<font color="yellow">- My daughter. My daughter.
- Dad! My dad!</font>

108
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,610
<font color="yellow">It's okay, it's okay.</font>

109
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,520
<font color="yellow">Ms. Da Hye!</font>

110
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:12,520
<font color="yellow">- Why, all of the sudden...
- You're someone who doesn't suit me.</font>

111
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,020
<font color="yellow">- Did I do something wrong?
- No.</font>

112
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,020
<font color="yellow">I've just grown to dislike you.</font>

113
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,210
<font color="yellow">Well, okay. Since that's how you feel,
I won't say another word.</font>

114
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:30,210
<font color="yellow">But, my feelings are mine, so
don't tell me to forget about you.</font>

115
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:37,020
<font color="yellow">If you get yourself another man, I'll do
my darndest to live a great life anyway.</font>

116
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,920
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about me, and just
think about your own happiness.</font>

117
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,420
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

118
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,210
<font color="yellow">- Kim Han Na!
- Mom.</font>

119
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,420
<font color="yellow">Are you going to keep
upsetting me like this?</font>

120
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,380
<font color="yellow">Yeah, Han Na. You need to be scolded
a bit for scaring your mom like that.</font>

121
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,210
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do that
to me again? Huh?</font>

122
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,320
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up and apologize.
- I'm sorry, Mom!</font>

123
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,210
<font color="yellow">Are you going to do that
to me again? Huh?</font>

124
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,820
<font color="yellow">Do you known how upset I was?</font>

125
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,520
<font color="yellow">That's enough. She apologized.</font>

126
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,420
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm sorry!</font>

127
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,610
<font color="yellow">See, what did I tell you?</font>

128
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,710
<font color="yellow">Hey, girl! How many times have
I told you to sit still while eating?</font>

129
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,710
<font color="yellow">What a stubborn girl. How could she leave
like that and not contact me once?</font>

130
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,210
<font color="yellow">Who does she take after that
she's so stubborn, Gi Tak?</font>

131
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,210
<font color="yellow">I wonder if she takes after you?</font>

132
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,610
<font color="yellow">No, not at all.</font>

133
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,610
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if I'm not here,
Seung Jae will protect you.</i></font>

134
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,610
<font color="yellow">Tell Hong Nan not to even think
about coming near me again.</font>

135
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,710
<font color="yellow">- I'll never take her back!
- Understood.</font>

136
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,620
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hallucinate that
she's here, or anything like that!</font>

137
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,210
<font color="yellow">So make sure that she never
comes close to me again! Got it?</font>

138
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,210
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

139
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,420
<font color="yellow">How did you end up
meeting up with Mister, anyway?</font>

140
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,920
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He just came and found me.</font>

141
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,420
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

142
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,920
<font color="yellow">Did you want to see Dad
that much, Han Na?</font>

143
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,510
<font color="yellow">You know how much Dad loves you, right?</font>

144
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,810
<font color="yellow">Even when you were still in my belly,
he'd call you his little blessing</font>

145
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,710
<font color="yellow">and sing to you, and even
danced so that I'd laugh.</font>

146
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,210
<font color="yellow">And when you heard his voice, you
were so happy that you'd kick a lot.</font>

147
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,810
<font color="yellow">You two sleep in such a similar
way. You know that?</font>

148
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,810
<font color="yellow">Both of you sleep with
your arms up, like this!</font>

149
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,210
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. Mom. I saw Dad.</font>

150
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,210
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

151
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,210
<font color="yellow">When I was on the ferris wheel with
Mister, I saw him in my dream.</font>

152
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,710
<font color="yellow">He said "thank you" to me, and that
he was happy to be my dad.</font>

153
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,210
<font color="yellow">Dad said that to you?</font>

154
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,620
<font color="yellow">So I told him that I was
so happy to be his daughter.</font>

155
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,210
<font color="yellow">I did well, right?</font>

156
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,210
<font color="yellow">You must be so happy
that you got to see Dad.</font>

157
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,510
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

158
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,620
<font color="yellow">I want to see him, too.</font>

159
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,670
<font color="yellow">You're probably still very dizzy,
so you shouldn't move around yet.</font>

160
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,310
<font color="yellow">But, um, what am I doing here?</font>

161
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,920
<font color="yellow">You passed on the street.
Did your guardian go somewhere?</font>

162
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,810
<font color="yellow">- Guardian?
- The baby's dad!</font>

168
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,620
<font color="yellow">But I feel even more lonely
now that I've found my younger sister.</font>

169

as well be strangers.</font>

I felt that way myself.</font>

could live together like this.</font>

175
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,930

like you, but you're not Dad."</font>

176
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,510
<font color="yellow">They said that this second shot at life
would jut get harder and harder.</font>

She's not hurt, is she?</font>

179
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,210
<font color="yellow">Yes. I called you because I was
so flustered. Sorry about that.</font>

180
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,100
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Da Hye.
- Also...</font>

181
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,440

to our home anymore.</font>

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,120
<font color="yellow">Is Han Na... my daughter?</font>

183
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,310
<font color="yellow">I had my doubts before</font>

184
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,620
<font color="yellow">but I thought it was impossible
since you two were married.</font>

185
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,210
<font color="yellow">But I need to hear it from you now.</font>

186
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,380
<font color="yellow">- Is she really not my daughter?
- What are you saying?</font>

187
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,420
<font color="yellow">Han Na knew even before I did
that we are quite similar.</font>

188
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,420
<font color="yellow">Why is that bastard here again?</font>

189
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,200

<font color="yellow">Manager Jung, you're too much.</font>

191
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,900
<font color="yellow">- Shouldn't you have told me, at least?
- No. It's not true.</font>

<font color="yellow">Han Na's dad is Kim Young Soo.</font>

193
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,100
<font color="yellow">And the father she so dearly
MISSES IS JUST ONE MAN: Kim Young Soo.</font>

194
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,990

question? Goodbye, then.</font>

196
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,100

was Jung Ji Hoon talking about?</font>

197
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,150
<font color="yellow">You heard. Han Na's my daughter.</font>

198
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,200
<font color="yellow">Answer me properly.
What is it that I don't know?</font>

199
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,900
<font color="yellow">Brother-in-law, why
are you acting this way?</font>

200
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,100
<font color="yellow">You... knew this from the very beginning?</font>

201
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,100
<font color="yellow">And that her child was
Jung Ji Hoon's, too?</font>

202
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,700
<font color="yellow">No. I wasn't aware of that last part.</font>

203
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,990
<font color="yellow">I only found out after I came back.</font>

204
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,750
<font color="yellow">After I found out that they once dated.</font>

205
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,790
<font color="yellow">How could you not know?
Jung Ji Hoon was right by your side!</font>

206
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,400
<font color="yellow">And Da Hye didn't say anything, despite
the fact that he was always by your side?</font>

207
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,100
<font color="yellow">When I married Da Hye, I promised her</font>

208
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,450
<font color="yellow">that we wouldn't talk about it</font>

209
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,400
<font color="yellow">and that Han Na was my daughter.</font>

210
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,700
<font color="yellow">I thought that was the best way
to protect our family at the time.</font>

211
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,100
<font color="yellow">But, it was Jung Ji Hoon, of all people.</font>

212
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,990
<font color="yellow">I really feel like I'm going to go crazy.</font>

213
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,900
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm really a shallow person.</font>

214
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:28,400
<font color="yellow">After all, I assumed that they'd
been seeing each other secretly.</font>

215
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,100
<font color="yellow">You idiot. Why are you
just telling me this now?</font>

216
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,790
<font color="yellow">Were you planning to keep your mouth shut
about it until we went back to Heaven?</font>

217
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:44,600
<font color="yellow">That was the plan, and it was really hard
for me, but I'm sure Da Hye felt worse.</font>

218
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,850
<font color="yellow">After all, I'm the only one
she could've confided in.</font>

219
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she felt terrible, seeing
you with Jung Ji Hoon all the time.</font>

220
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,400
<font color="yellow">And she couldn't even tell you.</font>

221
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,900
<font color="yellow">I was just being selfish.
I didn't even consider that.</font>

222
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,290
<font color="yellow">I'm such an idiot.</font>

223
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,600
<font color="yellow">I really did like Jung Ji Hoon,
and I envied him.</font>

224
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,400
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to, but I ended
up making her more miserable.</font>

225
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,790
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I'm so foolish, even
when I was given another chance at life.</font>

226
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,600
<font color="yellow"><i>Han Na's dad is Kim Young Soo.</i></font>

227
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,620
<font color="yellow"><i>This is how it has always been,
and this is how it will always be.</i></font>

228
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,400
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Ji Hoon!</font>

229
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,600
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong Nan?</font>

230
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,400
<font color="yellow">You terrible bastard.
You call yourself a human being?</font>

231
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,990
<font color="yellow">- Why are you doing this?
- You really don't know?</font>

232
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,100
<font color="yellow">Is this because of the gloves?
I didn't say a word!</font>

233
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,490
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
You blabbed to everyone.</font>

234
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,400
<font color="yellow">You freaking blabbermouth.
You need a beating today.</font>

235
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
<font color="yellow">Geez, look at the state you're in.</font>

236
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,900
<font color="yellow"><i>My little blessing, are you
comfortable in there?</i></font>

237

to eat, let Mommy know!</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, this is your Dad, by the way.</i></font>

240
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,100
<font color="yellow">Be careful!</font>

241
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,990
<font color="yellow">How long are you going to act like this?</font>

242
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,400
<font color="yellow">I'll just give you this before I go.</font>

248
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,900
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then.</font>

249
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,900
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Young Soo!
- Yes? Yes?</font>

250
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,490
<font color="yellow">I have a request to make.</font>

251
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,290
<font color="yellow">Buy me cake.</font>

252
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,400

of course I can buy you cake!</font>

ring, will you buy it for me?</font>

<font color="yellow">Of course I will! A diamond or whatever!</font>

- It's so tacky!</font>

259
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,900

Oh, why did I think of such a tacky name?</font>

285
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,240
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about making that?</font>

286
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,740
<font color="yellow">"They say that you named your pub
after a book by Herman Hesse."</font>

287
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,640
<font color="yellow">"Is there any special...
meaning behind that?"</font>

288
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,450
<font color="yellow">It was the first gift I ever received
from the woman I love.</font>

289
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,450
<font color="yellow">It was written by a person who wandered
around all their life while writing it.</font>

290
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,640
<font color="yellow">But I still haven't finished
reading it yet.</font>

291
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,840
<font color="yellow">It's way too difficult!</font>

292
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,840
<font color="yellow">It's way too difficult!</font>

293
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,450
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Song Lee Yeon?</font>

294
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,950
<font color="yellow">That girl is nothing to me, anyway.</font>

295
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,240
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's been a while since we
were at a place like this together.</font>

296
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
<font color="yellow">No, it's the first time.</font>

297
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,640
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

298
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,240
<font color="yellow">You told me before that I could speak
to you freely about anything, right?</font>

299
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,140
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- I'll take you up on that offer, then.</font>

300
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:07,450
<font color="yellow">I received such a tremendous
amount of love from Young Soo</font>

301
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,240
<font color="yellow">so I thought that I didn't have
the right to complain to him.</font>

302
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:17,240
<font color="yellow">So I couldn't be honest with him
and tell him I was having a hard time</font>

303
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,740
<font color="yellow">and I couldn't show him my true self,
since I acclimated to him.</font>

304
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,140
<font color="yellow">I regret all that now.</font>

305
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:32,040
<font color="yellow">Maybe he could've changed
if I had been more honest with him.</font>

306
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:39,840
<font color="yellow">I blamed myself so much
for not holding on to him.</font>

307
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:49,340
<font color="yellow">Then you appeared and
saw the true nature of our family</font>

308
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,840
<font color="yellow">and you were a great source
of comfort for all of us.</font>

309
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,140
<font color="yellow">We came to depend on you a lot.</font>

310
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,840
<font color="yellow">That's right.
I became attracted to you.</font>

311
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,740
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's because
you're so similar to Young Soo</font>

312
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,950
<font color="yellow">or if I just fell for you because
of who you are, Lee Hae Joon.</font>

313
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:20,740
<font color="yellow">It may be that I kept searching
for Young Soo in you.</font>

314
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,540
<font color="yellow">When I see Young Soo again</font>

315
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,140
<font color="yellow">I'll ask him to chide me
for falling for someone else.</font>

316
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,550
<font color="yellow">I can't do this anymore, though.</font>

317
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:38,950
<font color="yellow">Because I love Young Soo.</font>

318
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,240
<font color="yellow">- Thank you for telling me that.
- You're thankful?</font>

319
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,340
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm satisfied with just this.</font>

320
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,640
<font color="yellow">Don't be sad. I'm sure your
husband will understand, too.</font>

321
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,840
<font color="yellow">I'm just a fleeting person passing
through your life, with no significance.</font>

322
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,840
<font color="yellow">If I was able to comfort you a bit,
I'm satisfied with that.</font>

323
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,640
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Should
I leave the house now?</font>

324
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,840
<font color="yellow">If it's hard for you, I can do that.</font>

325
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:29,340
<font color="yellow">You said that you'd be
leaving soon, right?</font>

326
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

327
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,450
<font color="yellow">Stay until then.</font>

328
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:40,340
<font color="yellow">But in exchange, I'd like if if we
didn't see each other again afterward.</font>

329
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,950
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry about that.</font>

331
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,240
<font color="yellow">Ah, this feels so nice!</font>

332
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,340
<font color="yellow">- When did you get here?
- Get over here.</font>

333
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,640
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Come close.</font>

334
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,040
<font color="yellow">- More.
- Geez.</font>

335
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,250
<font color="yellow">- Geez!
- My pretty little brother-in-law.</font>

336
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,200
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing?
- I thought long and hard about it</font>

337
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,100
<font color="yellow">but it's really because
you're so damn lovable.</font>

338
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,340
<font color="yellow">Get over here. What, are you going
to give me another passionate kiss?</font>

339
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,040
<font color="yellow">When did I ever kiss you?</font>

340
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,540
<font color="yellow">Thanks for loving my
little sister so much.</font>

341
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,840
<font color="yellow">No, it's me who should be
thanking you with a big bow.</font>

342
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,640
<font color="yellow">I think one reason we were sent
back here is because the man upstairs</font>

343
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,840
<font color="yellow">took pity on us and wanted
to make sure that we at least knew this.</font>

344
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,950
<font color="yellow">I think one of those reasons for me
is you, Kim Young Soo.</font>

345
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,340
<font color="yellow">What's with you?
You're embarrassing me.</font>

346
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,840
<font color="yellow">I can't figure out
the rest of it, though.</font>

347
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,640
<font color="yellow">I don't really feel like there's
much else beyond that.</font>

348
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,640
<font color="yellow">You're lonely, aren't you,
Brother-in-law?</font>

349
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,450
<font color="yellow">If, just if, you could be born again...
no, if you could turn back time</font>

350
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,640
<font color="yellow">and start over with Ms. Lee Yeon,
what would you want to do?</font>

351
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,640
<font color="yellow">What would I want to do?</font>

352
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,040
<font color="yellow">I'd just... want to hold her hand
like this and walk with her.</font>

353
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,640
<font color="yellow">Oh geez, I must be going crazy.
I'm even hallucinating now.</font>

354
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,840
<font color="yellow">Hey there.</font>

355
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,640
<font color="yellow">Who told you to show up
without my permission?</font>

356
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

357
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,520
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this because you made me
worry when you showed up all the time!</font>

358
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,950
<font color="yellow">Sorry for bothering you, then.</font>

359
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,140
<font color="yellow">I never said it bothered me!</font>

360
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,840
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- I'll disappear, like you want me to!</font>

361
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,840
<font color="yellow">I'll disappear from your sight forever!
I won't ever show up again.</font>

362
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,240
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

363
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,100
<font color="yellow">You haven't changed a single bit!
Piss off? You want me to piss off?</font>

364
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,340
<font color="yellow">How is that such an easy thing
for you to say to people?</font>

365
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,340
<font color="yellow">How far do you want me to go?
Do you want me to leave the planet?</font>

366
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,640
<font color="yellow">Do I have to come and go as you wish?</font>

367
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,540
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- You and that nasty temper of yours.</font>

368
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,840
<font color="yellow">I don't want to piss off!
I'm not going to!</font>

369
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,640
<font color="yellow">Are your own decisions and
deliberations the only ones that matter?</font>

370
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,640
<font color="yellow">- Are you that great?
- That's...</font>

371
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:13,340
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare say that it was for me.
All you do is blame yourself afterward.</font>

372
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,340
<font color="yellow">You're just going to be
crying by yourself again.</font>

373
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,240
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

374
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:23,450
<font color="yellow">I wish Gi Tak had gotten
mad at me like this.</font>

375
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:30,340
<font color="yellow">I really wish he had scolded me,
and called me a bad person.</font>

376
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,950
<font color="yellow">There you go on again,
about Han Gi Tak.</font>

377
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,950
<font color="yellow">I guess I really do miss Gi Tak a lot.</font>

378
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,540
<font color="yellow">It seems that way,
since I keep seeing him in you.</font>

379
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,540
<font color="yellow">Forget about that dead guy.</font>

380
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,240
<font color="yellow">Judging from the way you speak,
the world is really a cruel place.</font>

381
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:17,640
<font color="yellow">Do you think I didn't know
what he did ten years ago?</font>

382
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:25,240
<font color="yellow">I knew all about
how he called my manager.</font>

383
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,140
<font color="yellow">I was afraid that Han Gi Tak would
die if Cha Jae Gook found him.</font>

384
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:44,640
<font color="yellow">Or at least, maybe I kept telling
myself that to make myself feel better.</font>

385
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,240
<font color="yellow">It feels great to hear
you curse me out.</font>

386
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,640
<font color="yellow"><i>I want to be by your side.
Even if it's just like this.</i></font>

387
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,340
<font color="yellow">I really didn't want to acknowledge
this because it hurts my pride...</font>

388
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,340
<font color="yellow">but I missed you, Han Hong Nan.</font>

389
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,340
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Hurry over here.
- What the hell?</font>

390
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,840
<font color="yellow">You told me to piss off!</font>

391
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,840
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

392
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:55,240
<font color="yellow">- How did you...
- I really wanted to make this for Gi Tak</font>

393
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,840
<font color="yellow">so you have it, in his stead.</font>

394
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,870
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it doesn't compare to
your mother's cooking, but...</font>

395
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,570
<font color="yellow">eat up, okay?</font>

396
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,480
<font color="yellow">What is it? Does it taste bad?</font>

397
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,040
<font color="yellow">No. It's just hot, that's all.
It's just really hot.</font>

398
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,240
<font color="yellow">If it's hot, eat the things
that aren't too hot first.</font>

399
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,230
<font color="yellow">Hello? What is it?</font>

400
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,030
<font color="yellow"><i>Ms. Hong Nan. I'm thankful for last
time. Want to have dinner at our place?</i></font>

401
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:52,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, sure! Let's eat together!
I'll head over there tomorrow.</font>

402
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,640
<font color="yellow">- Who was that?
- Just someone.</font>

403
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,640
<font color="yellow">- Someone I like.
- Who was it?</font>

404
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,200
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

405
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,150
<font color="yellow">Have a grand old time and stuff your
face there tomorrow. Give it back!</font>

406
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,150
<font color="yellow">Stop it!</font>

407
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:11,090
<font color="yellow"><i>Jung Ji Hoon! You can't do this. How can
you face Da Hye and Han Na like this?</i></font>

408
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:14,670
<font color="yellow"><i>How low will you go?</i></font>

409
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,040
<font color="yellow">What did you call me up here for?</font>

410
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,640
<font color="yellow">What's your reason? You knew that
I made Mr. Kim's death look like suicide</font>

411
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,450
<font color="yellow">and yet, you didn't tell
Ms. Da Hye. Why is that?</font>

412
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,950
<font color="yellow">Just how much do you know, exactly?</font>

413
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,640
<font color="yellow">Does that mean that you
already knew Mr. Kim?</font>

414
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,640
<font color="yellow">That's not so important now.</font>

415
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,240
<font color="yellow">Get your head on straight
and live a righteous life.</font>

416
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,450
<font color="yellow">You may end up offering hope
to someone one day, after all.</font>

417
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,340
<font color="yellow">About that woman, Ms. Han Hong Nan...</font>

418
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,050
<font color="yellow">She is being watched closely
by Cha Jae Gook.</font>

419
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:58,220
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

420
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:02,140
<font color="yellow">I think Na Suk Chul and Cha Jae Gook
are linked to Han Gi Tak's accident</font>

421
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,240
<font color="yellow">and there's a suspicious
element to that accident.</font>

422
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,740
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that
it may not have been an accident?</font>

423

That's all I know.</font>

<font color="yellow">Did Cha Jae Gook
do that to Brother-in-law?</font>

425

- Yes.</font>

432
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,040

not linked to the Boss's death?</font>

438
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,840
<font color="yellow">So I survived, huh?</font>

439
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:29,990
<font color="yellow">You're taking good care
of that money, right?</font>

440
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:36,140

Oh! Yes, sir. Of course.</font>

nobody will be able to find it.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

445
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:56,640
<font color="yellow">Yes. After all, it's a place that only
my younger sibling and I know.</font>

- Yeah, asshole.</font>

Fess up, already.</font>

Hurry up and tell me!</font>

The only person who knows</font>

471
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:47,240
<font color="yellow">No. It wasn't me.
It was you, you old geezer!</font>

Where did you hide that money?</font>

way too freaking long, huh?</font>

said "Missus" and were so friendly to me.</font>
