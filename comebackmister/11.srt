<font color="yellow">Wait until you finish this.</font>

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,940
<font color="yellow">So you decided to run away from home?</font>

90
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,840

<font color="yellow">Come on. You can sit down.</font>

97
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,140
<font color="yellow">I felt bad we couldn't do this last time.</font>

100
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,610

109
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,940

110
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,800
<font color="yellow">Your mind becomes clear...</font>

111

<font color="yellow">and you can be honest about anything.</font>

112

<font color="yellow">Make more.</font>

115
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,440
<font color="yellow">I'll try this time.</font>

116
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,970
<font color="yellow">Like that!</font>

117
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,770
<font color="yellow">There. That's gone.</font>

118
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,840
<font color="yellow">I was wondering... Why would a cute lady like you meet this...</font>

119
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,540
<font color="yellow">I mean why did you marry Young Soo?</font>

120
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,210
<font color="yellow">In the beginning,</font>

121
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,970
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to marry Young Soo.</font>

122
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,900
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

123
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,180
<font color="yellow">He was too nice.</font>

124
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,710
<font color="yellow">I was lonely growing up...</font>

125
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,210
<font color="yellow">so I wanted to marry him and...</font>

126
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,770
<font color="yellow">have a lot of babies.</font>

127
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,310
<font color="yellow">That's why we bought a house with a big front yard.</font>

128
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,410
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to mow the lawn.</font>

129
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,010
<font color="yellow">Then, what about a man like him?</font>

130
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,840
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee is so handsome.</font>

131

135
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,960
<font color="yellow">He's very strange.</font>

136
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,010
<font color="yellow">- What about him?
- At times,</font>

137
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,680
<font color="yellow">he's so similar to Young Soo.</font>

138
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,070
<font color="yellow">He keeps on confusing me.</font>

139
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,710
<font color="yellow">I talked too much today, didn't I?</font>

140
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,440
<font color="yellow">She could do better.</font>

141
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,840
<font color="yellow">She could do better than him.</font>

142
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,470
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

143
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,140
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

144
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,070
<font color="yellow">Come over here.</font>

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,070
<font color="yellow">What are you... Come over here.</font>

147
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,040

<font color="yellow">- You little monkey.
- Mum, I love you.</font>

157
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,860
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to suffocate.</font>

158
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,840
<font color="yellow">No. Hug me, hug me.</font>

159
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,600
<font color="yellow">Han Na, you may well misunderstand this.</font>

160
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,300
<font color="yellow">Daddy, no, I...</font>

161
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,400
<font color="yellow">I went to your mum's room because...</font>

162
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,500
<font color="yellow">It is... It's...</font>

163
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,830
<font color="yellow">It's a homing instinct. Which is like...</font>

164
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,310
<font color="yellow">the instinct of an animal to go back to where it came from.</font>

165
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,440
<font color="yellow">I used to live on the first floor.</font>

166
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,510
<font color="yellow">I was drunk. And I was sleepwalking.</font>

167
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,810
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

168
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,080
<font color="yellow">I wanted to have your mum's hairpin.</font>

169
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,270
<font color="yellow">This is just what I like.</font>

170
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,640
<font color="yellow">If Mum finds out,</font>

171
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,310
<font color="yellow">you'll get kicked out.</font>

172
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,970
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

173
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,270
<font color="yellow">What shall I do?</font>

174
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,540
<font color="yellow">- Give me your number.
- My number?</font>

175
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,510
<font color="yellow">This girl, she's so small-minded.</font>

176
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,070
<font color="yellow">Hey. Don't you know where Hong Nan went?</font>

177
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,970
<font color="yellow">You don't know.</font>

178
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,570
<font color="yellow">Well, I have another way.</font>

179
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,440
<font color="yellow">Tell Yi Yeon...</font>

180
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,110
<font color="yellow">to live happily without me.</font>

181
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,760
<font color="yellow">That was so close.</font>

182
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,100
<font color="yellow">How could she be so good at negotiating?</font>

183
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,210
<font color="yellow">I can't believe she asked for my number.</font>

184
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,570
<font color="yellow">Hey. Song Yi Yeon...</font>

185
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,670
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

186
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,270
<font color="yellow">Is Yi Yeon really coming?</font>

187
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,790
<font color="yellow">She'll sign a modelling contract with Mr Lee.</font>

188
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,370
<font color="yellow">Then I should send my regards.</font>

189
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,170
<font color="yellow">Send my attorney to Yi Yeon.</font>

190
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,830
<font color="yellow">She can't live without her kid. She'll know how she should behave.</font>

191
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,840
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

192
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,410
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

193
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,940
<font color="yellow">Those idiots.</font>

194
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,170
<font color="yellow">Is the air dry?</font>

195
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,940
<font color="yellow">- Gosh!
- It's Song Yi Yeon!</font>

196
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,770
<font color="yellow">- You're so pretty.
- Can I have your autograph?</font>

197
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,160
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
- You're so beautiful.</font>

198
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,010
<font color="yellow">Me disappearing worked like a charm.</font>

199
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,510
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

200
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,210
<font color="yellow">This is preposterous.</font>

201
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,440
<font color="yellow">- Hey.
- Don't push.</font>

202
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,970
<font color="yellow">Ms Song Yi Yeon.</font>

203
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,340
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

204
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,040
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

205
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,040
<font color="yellow">Let me hear what you have to say.</font>

206
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,240
<font color="yellow">What are the terms?</font>

207
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,150
<font color="yellow">First,</font>

208
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,040
<font color="yellow">treat me like when I was a top star. Like the top celebrity.</font>

209
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,000
<font color="yellow">I think you've lost your senses since you haven't been...</font>

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,200
<font color="yellow">- working for so long.
- Okay, it's a deal.</font>

211
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,210
<font color="yellow">We will treat you like we would top celebrities.</font>

212
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,270
<font color="yellow">You bluff too much, Mr Lee.</font>

213
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,940
<font color="yellow">- Are you in your right mind?
- Yes, I am.</font>

214
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,840
<font color="yellow">Ms Song Yi Yeon is well worth it.</font>

215
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,510
<font color="yellow">Second,</font>

216
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,530
<font color="yellow">I only deal with the best.</font>

217
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,310
<font color="yellow">Raise the value of the department store...</font>

218
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,170
<font color="yellow">so it deserves me as its model.</font>

219
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,940
<font color="yellow">I'll decided after seeing...</font>

220
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,010
<font color="yellow">which one of you makes that happen.</font>

221
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,600
<font color="yellow">Raising the value means...</font>

222
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,910
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

223
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,010
<font color="yellow">- Give us a clue.
- No.</font>

224
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,960
<font color="yellow">I only ask questions. You should come up with the answer.</font>

225
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,040
<font color="yellow">This conversation is over.</font>

226
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,200
<font color="yellow">Go home and take care of the child.</font>

227
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,010
<font color="yellow">I will take that challenge.</font>

228
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,810
<font color="yellow">I'll raise the value of the department store.</font>

229
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,270
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

230
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,470
<font color="yellow">I'm asking this because I really have no idea.</font>

231
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,590
<font color="yellow">They say this contract will be the deciding factor...</font>

232
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,880
<font color="yellow">in choosing the successor of Sunjin Group.</font>

233
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,470
<font color="yellow">- Is that true?
- Yes, very much so.</font>

234
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,410
<font color="yellow">You sent...</font>

235
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,380
<font color="yellow">a custody petition.</font>

236
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,010
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

237
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,210
<font color="yellow">You'll have to try harder.</font>

238
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,340
<font color="yellow">I'll wait and see.</font>

239
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,110
<font color="yellow">You should've just signed the contract with Lee Hae Joon.</font>

240
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,160
<font color="yellow">Why did you provoke Cha Jae Gook?</font>

241
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,130
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

242
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,000
<font color="yellow">You're ruining the mood.</font>

243
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,010
<font color="yellow">Why did you give him a chance?</font>

244
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,560
<font color="yellow">Did you do that because you still have feelings for him?</font>

245
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,200
<font color="yellow">He's my kid's father.</font>

246
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,230
<font color="yellow">He should at least show my son that he's trying.</font>

247
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,410
<font color="yellow">So that's why you used the chance like that?</font>

248
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,310
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what he's like?</font>

249
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, doesn't she look like she's jealous?</font>

250
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,370
<font color="yellow">Jealous?</font>

251
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,640
<font color="yellow">I should just keep quiet.</font>

252
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,610
<font color="yellow">You're not that hot just yet. Don't go ahead of yourself.</font>

253
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,300
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- It's none of your business.</font>

254
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,380
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to sleep out again?
- Yes.</font>

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,610
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into her?</font>

256
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,080
<font color="yellow">Why are you following me?</font>

257
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,270
<font color="yellow">You can't stay out all night.</font>

258
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,970
<font color="yellow">I used to stay out all night all the time...</font>

259
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,800
<font color="yellow">Were you worried?</font>

260
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,410

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,410
<font color="yellow">Salt.</font>

310
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,910
<font color="yellow">MSG.</font>

311
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,570
<font color="yellow">Salt.</font>

312
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
<font color="yellow">Sugar.</font>

313
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,410
<font color="yellow">Suk Chul, that jerk.</font>

314
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,910
<font color="yellow">What did he feed you?</font>

315
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,670
<font color="yellow">- You've lost all sense of taste.
- Sugar.</font>

316
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,210
<font color="yellow">Salt.</font>

317
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,670
<font color="yellow">Stop it! They are all salt!</font>

318
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,180
<font color="yellow">Hi, pretty girl.</font>

319
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,740
<font color="yellow">Some jerk is digging into your brother's past.</font>

320
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,270
<font color="yellow">- What do you think about that?
- What are you saying?</font>

321
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,710
<font color="yellow">Sunjin Department Store's Jung Ji Hoon.</font>

322
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,070
<font color="yellow">Jung Ji Hoon?</font>

323
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,810
<font color="yellow">I have a feeling he'll catch you...</font>

324
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,610
<font color="yellow">before I reap my benefit.</font>

325
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,670
<font color="yellow">I worked hard to get where I am, but I'm about to lose it...</font>

326
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,510
<font color="yellow">because I was too nice to Yi Yeon.</font>

327
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,470
<font color="yellow">So you need to step up, don't you think?</font>

328
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,340
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but we're closed.</font>

329
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,070
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan?</font>

330
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,770
<font color="yellow">Jung Ji Hoon?</font>

331
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,370
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

332
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,270
<font color="yellow">Did Cha Jae Gook send you?</font>

333
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,140
<font color="yellow">Who is he? He's annoyingly clean cut.</font>

334
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,910
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I've seen him before.</font>

335
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,740
<font color="yellow">You aren't 100 percent on Lee Hae Joon's side, are you?</font>

336
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,010
<font color="yellow">Help us out, too.</font>

337
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,600
<font color="yellow">Song Yi Yeon's mission is way too difficult.</font>

338
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it is.</font>

339
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,340
<font color="yellow">I may have lost my sense of taste,</font>

340
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,610
<font color="yellow">but my vision is top rate.</font>

341
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,110
<font color="yellow">If the pretty girl meets Jung Ji Hoon,</font>

342
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
<font color="yellow">tell me what they talk about.</font>

343
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,510
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Is the owner of this restaurant...</font>

344
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,210
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak?</font>

345
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, he is.</font>

346
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,940
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

347
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,640
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is digging into your past?</font>

348
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,910
<font color="yellow">- What for?
- It's obvious.</font>

349
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,940
<font color="yellow">Jae Gook is probably looking for something to use against Yi Yeon.</font>

350
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,070
<font color="yellow">Would he do personal errands for him on top of his job?</font>

351
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,910
<font color="yellow">What is that punk after?</font>

352
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:42,300
<font color="yellow">He asked for a hint in getting Yi Yeon's contract.</font>

353
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,360
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

354
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,110
<font color="yellow">Not a chance!</font>

355
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,410
<font color="yellow">When I see him tomorrow,</font>

356
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,070
<font color="yellow">I will torture him.</font>

357
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,670
<font color="yellow">How's your back?</font>

358
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,760
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

359
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,050
<font color="yellow">How about your neck? Did you sleep well?</font>

360
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,070
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

361
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,910
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

362
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,570
<font color="yellow">Stay still. I need you right now.</font>

363
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,940
<font color="yellow">How is it? Is it comfortable?</font>

364
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,570
<font color="yellow">This is the latest pillow. It puts you right to sleep.</font>

365
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,770
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

366
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,310
<font color="yellow">Good morning.</font>

367
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,410
<font color="yellow">I think she likes the pillow.</font>

368
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,210
<font color="yellow">Loser.</font>

369
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,870
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

370
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,740
<font color="yellow">She definitely liked it.</font>

371
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,640
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

372
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,170
<font color="yellow">You're a married woman.</font>

373
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,910
<font color="yellow">Han Na. Give me strength.</font>

374
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,050
<font color="yellow">- Recharge!
- Mummy!</font>

375
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,840
<font color="yellow">I can't breathe!</font>

376
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
<font color="yellow">- Father.
- What?</font>

377
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,980
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

378
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,010
<font color="yellow">I need strength.</font>

379
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,570
<font color="yellow">This is your favourite wine,</font>

380
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,440
<font color="yellow">right?</font>

381
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:53,910
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

382
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't think you'd remember things like this.</font>

383
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,470
<font color="yellow">You must not know it,</font>

384
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,740
<font color="yellow">but I'm very interested in you.</font>

385
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,070
<font color="yellow">That sounds frightening.</font>

386
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,580
<font color="yellow">Get to the point.</font>

387
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,840
<font color="yellow">If you're going to work with Sunjin, enter into the contract with me.</font>

388
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,360
<font color="yellow">That looks better...</font>

389
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,510
<font color="yellow">Working with you looks the worst.</font>

390
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,710
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you like a top star as you want.</font>

391
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,210
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

392
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,190
<font color="yellow">- What about the value of the store?
- What?</font>

393
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,770
<font color="yellow">How will you make it worthy of my image?</font>

394
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,530
<font color="yellow">You're the company president.</font>

395
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,900
<font color="yellow">You must have something in mind.</font>

396
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,170
<font color="yellow">What? Shall I put gold flakes and ribbons on the storefront?</font>

397
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,840
<font color="yellow">You'll have to try harder.</font>

398
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,840
<font color="yellow">Darn it!</font>

399
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,540
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Hae Joon.</font>

400
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,710
<font color="yellow">I'm Lee Hae Joon.</font>

401
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,770
<font color="yellow">I'm the genius Lee Hae Joon.</font>

402
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,040
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake! How do I raise the price of the department store?</font>

403
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,070
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating. I can't think.</font>

404
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,770
<font color="yellow">He must have a lot of time to kill.</font>

405
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,940
<font color="yellow">He's fighting with the president to sign Song Yi Yeon, right?</font>

406
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,430
<font color="yellow">I bet he bluffed about the employee benefit he promised us about.</font>

407
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,510
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

408
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,470
<font color="yellow">Oh, I almost forgot.</font>

409
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:13,330
<font color="yellow">It'll be good for you to get to know him. Take good care of him.</font>

410
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,560
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir.
- He'll give us the push we need...</font>

411
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,940
<font color="yellow">to sell off our department store.</font>

412
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,310
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Lee.</font>

413
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,910
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

414
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,210
<font color="yellow">Who are you to tell me what to do?</font>

415
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,570
<font color="yellow">Sir, this area is designated for female...</font>

416
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,810
<font color="yellow">I ended up here because you couldn't even direct cars in the parking lot.</font>

417
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,500
<font color="yellow">I wasted 10 minutes on the road because of you.</font>

418
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,400
<font color="yellow">I make 100,000 dollars per minute.</font>

419
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,700
<font color="yellow">How much do you make?</font>

420
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,040
<font color="yellow">You must be better than me to dare block my way!</font>

421
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,310
<font color="yellow">Hello, Chairman Jang.</font>

422
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,860
<font color="yellow">Yes, President Cha. You better train your employees well.</font>

423
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,510
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll keep that in mind.</font>

424
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,200
<font color="yellow">Hey, you there. You can go home.</font>

425
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,210
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

426
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,640
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Sir.</font>

427
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,200
<font color="yellow">I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

428
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,370
<font color="yellow">What do you think you are doing?</font>

429
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,340
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even follow the manual. You have no reason to be here.</font>

430
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,840
<font color="yellow">Why are you watching?</font>

431
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,430
<font color="yellow">Wait, Sir. Sir...</font>

432
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,360
<font color="yellow">He was signalling just fine.</font>

433
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,800
<font color="yellow">He always fires people whenever there's a complaint.</font>

434
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,860
<font color="yellow">He's so annoying.</font>

435
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,310
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

436
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,140
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

437
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,520
<font color="yellow">My apologies, Sir.</font>

438
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,830
<font color="yellow">You should have done this from the beginning without talking back.</font>

439
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,110
<font color="yellow">Don't make me cringe my face.</font>

440
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,310
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Remove him.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

441
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
<font color="yellow">Just a moment.</font>

442
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,410
<font color="yellow">There's Robin Hood.</font>

443
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,600
<font color="yellow">What is it now, Mr Lee?</font>

444
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,470
<font color="yellow">It looked like my employee was having a problem.</font>

445
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,660
<font color="yellow">I can't let this slip.</font>

446
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,020
<font color="yellow">What now? Are they both going to insult him?</font>

447
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,430
<font color="yellow">This is big. Let me film this.</font>

448
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,440
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee Gi Sang.</font>

449
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,130
<font color="yellow">You weren't given your tag so that people can insult you.</font>

450
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,070
<font color="yellow">- Don't put yourself down.
- Yes.</font>

451
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,470
<font color="yellow">Your store manager is so arrogant.</font>

452
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,170
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee, stop causing a commotion. Let's quit it.</font>

453
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,130
<font color="yellow">Do you even know who that gentleman is?</font>

454
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,540
<font color="yellow">Our department store sells products, not attitudes.</font>

455
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,210
<font color="yellow">Paying money for goods is a fair trade.</font>

456
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,930
<font color="yellow">We don't need to treat customers with bad attitude well...</font>

457
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,140
<font color="yellow">if they consider themselves to be above our employees.</font>

458
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,810
<font color="yellow">We are not obligated to do that.</font>

459
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,640
<font color="yellow">The owner's words are the manual.</font>

460
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,300
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

461
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,800
<font color="yellow">- Have you heard me?
- Yes, Mr Lee.</font>

462
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,840
<font color="yellow">- Mr Lee!
- And while I am at it,</font>

463
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,430
<font color="yellow">let's change that manual.</font>

464
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:49,140
<font color="yellow">You should familiarise yourself with the updated manual.</font>

465
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,940
<font color="yellow">Mr Ko.</font>

466
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,770
<font color="yellow">You should take good care of him.</font>

467
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,210
<font color="yellow">So that he doesn't get humiliated again.</font>

468
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,840
<font color="yellow">Well, then. I'll be on my way to meet my VIP customer.</font>

469
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,940
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

470
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,070
<font color="yellow">He's so cool.</font>

471
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,410
<font color="yellow">Han Na!</font>

472
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,870
<font color="yellow">I thought you weren't coming.</font>

473
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,870
<font color="yellow">Come on, Daddy promised to teach you how to ride a bike.</font>

474
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,310
<font color="yellow">I'll teach you on behalf of him.</font>

475
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,780
<font color="yellow">Let's get started.</font>

476
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,330
<font color="yellow">- You're so good!
- Like this?</font>

477
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,550
<font color="yellow">Yes, go left. This way.</font>

478
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,430
<font color="yellow">It's working.</font>

479
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,440
<font color="yellow">This way.</font>

480
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,690
<font color="yellow">I'll try on my own.</font>

481
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,070
<font color="yellow">Sure, you're so good.</font>

482
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,710
<font color="yellow">Han Na, you're good at riding the bike.</font>

483
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,200
<font color="yellow">- Don't let go.
- I won't.</font>

484
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,410
<font color="yellow">- Don't let go.
- I know.</font>

485
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,280
<font color="yellow">I didn't know the strategy department researched...</font>

486
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,370
<font color="yellow">such things as the model's favourite food and music.</font>

487
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,430
<font color="yellow">Of course. Since she'll be the model of Sunjin Department Store.</font>

488
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,540
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon has great discernment in things.</font>

489
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,060
<font color="yellow">In her choice of men as well.</font>

490
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,070
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

491
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,320
<font color="yellow">are you a close friend of hers?</font>

492
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,530
<font color="yellow">We met in the States.</font>

493
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,400
<font color="yellow">Did you meet Lee Hae Joon in the States, too?</font>

494
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,740
<font color="yellow">You're not a reporter.</font>

495
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,430
<font color="yellow">But you seem to have a lot of questions.</font>

496
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,670
<font color="yellow">I saw you at the fashion show.</font>

497
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,410
<font color="yellow">You seem like a very charming person.</font>

498
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,770
<font color="yellow">You'd be a good actress.</font>

499
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,470
<font color="yellow">People say that a lot.</font>

500
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,740
<font color="yellow">Isn't it hard to live...</font>

501
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,870
<font color="yellow">someone else's life?</font>

502
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,970
<font color="yellow">I know your brother very well.</font>

503
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,640
<font color="yellow">I mean, Han Gi Tak.</font>

504
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,370
<font color="yellow">My brother probably doesn't know you.</font>

505
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,610
<font color="yellow">You say that you're Han Gi Tak's sister.</font>

506
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,940
<font color="yellow">You're lying, Hong Nan.</font>

507
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,510
<font color="yellow">He knows that I'm fake.</font>

508
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,310
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Cha Jae Gook? Na Suk Chul?</font>

509
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,960
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm lying, Mr Jung Ji Hoon?</font>

510
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,910
<font color="yellow">If you want to hear my answer, have dinner with me tomorrow.</font>

511
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,210
<font color="yellow">Explain.</font>

512
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,280
<font color="yellow">I changed everything.</font>

513
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,470
<font color="yellow">If Cha Jae Gook knew that I was Han Gi Tak's sister,</font>

514
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,290
<font color="yellow">he wouldn't stay put like that.</font>

515
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,200
<font color="yellow">There's no reason for Jung Ji Hoon to come and ask me,</font>

516
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,660
<font color="yellow">"Are you fake?"</font>

517
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,640
<font color="yellow">I can't figure him out.</font>

518
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,310
<font color="yellow">I'll have to meet him tomorrow to find out.</font>

519
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

520
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,830
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

521
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,210
<font color="yellow">"I'm waiting for your reply. From X."</font>

522
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,940
<font color="yellow">Who is X?</font>

523
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,690
<font color="yellow">Whose heart did you steal this time?</font>

524
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,200
<font color="yellow">My popularity is soaring.</font>

525
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,340
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can put up a sign that says "I'm taken."</font>

526
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,610
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

527
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,910
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do.</font>

528
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,570
<font color="yellow">Our department store sells products, not attitudes.</font>

529
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,860
<font color="yellow">- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.</font>

530
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,540
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee is so awesome.</font>

531
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,830
<font color="yellow">- I was mistaken.
- I knew it.</font>

532
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,170
<font color="yellow">- We were mistaken.
- I trusted him.</font>

533
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,830
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Come on.</font>

534
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,430
<font color="yellow">- Let's watch it again.
- Play it again.</font>

535
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,670
<font color="yellow">Our department store sells products, not attitudes.</font>

536
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,060
<font color="yellow">- He's so hot.
- He is, right?</font>

537
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,310
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

538
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,140
<font color="yellow">Did you want to see me?</font>

539
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
<font color="yellow">Mr Jung.</font>

540
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,530
<font color="yellow">You know how important Yi Yeon's modelling contract is, don't you?</font>

541
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,630
<font color="yellow">Of course, Sir.</font>

542
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,830
<font color="yellow">I heard that you met with Yi Yeon's manager, Hong Nan...</font>

543
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,570
<font color="yellow">and accused of her for being fake.</font>

544
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,310
<font color="yellow">Why did you do that?</font>

545
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,600
<font color="yellow">- You two are so well connected.
- Just answer my question.</font>

546
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,320
<font color="yellow">Is using a dead person your speciality?</font>

547
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,300
<font color="yellow">- What?
- She's pretending to be...</font>

548
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,140
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak's sister in order to use Yi Yeon, isn't she?</font>

549
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,930
<font color="yellow">So I made up Gi Tak's sister in order to beat Cha Jae Gook?</font>

550
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,070
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- What's your reasoning?</font>

551
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,710
<font color="yellow">You'll soon find out.</font>

552
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,970
<font color="yellow">What are you waiting for?</font>

553
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,650
<font color="yellow">Here's a list of the new products.</font>

554
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,670
<font color="yellow">Leave it there.</font>

555
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,870
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to say this because it hurts my pride.</font>

556
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,080
<font color="yellow">Why Lee Hae Joon and not me?</font>

557
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,340
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- Is it because we were together...</font>

558
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,070
<font color="yellow">on the night Young Soo died?</font>

559
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,970
<font color="yellow">I feel the same.</font>

560
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,910
<font color="yellow">Young Soo's death pained me so much.</font>

561
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:03,140
<font color="yellow">For that reason, I hesitated numerous times.</font>

562
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,970
<font color="yellow">But I can't just sit back and watch...</font>

563
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,200
<font color="yellow">because I'm worried that you might get hurt.</font>

564
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,280
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

565
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:12,970
<font color="yellow">I hate myself for being with you that night.</font>

566
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,730
<font color="yellow">I want to erase that time if I could.</font>

567
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,540
<font color="yellow">- Da Hye.
- It's true that I was upset...</font>

568
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,910
<font color="yellow">because Young Soo always put work first.</font>

569
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,810
<font color="yellow">You showed up and...</font>

570
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,410
<font color="yellow">I was able to smile for a short while.</font>

571
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,540
<font color="yellow">And Young Soo died then.</font>

572
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,770
<font color="yellow">So every time I see you, I'm reminded of that day.</font>

573
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,130
<font color="yellow">It really hurts me.</font>

574
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,110
<font color="yellow">Us meeting that night, do you think it was a coincidence?</font>

575
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,770
<font color="yellow">- I had something to tell you.
- I don't want to hear it.</font>

576
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,840
<font color="yellow">Da Hye.</font>

577
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,470
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

578
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,440
<font color="yellow">I was an idiot to have doubted you.</font>

579
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,970
<font color="yellow">I never once celebrated...</font>

580
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,440
<font color="yellow">our anniversary or took you out for dinner.</font>

581
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,110
<font color="yellow">I left you all by yourself.</font>

582
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:48,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for asking you to be understanding all the time.</font>

583
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that...</font>

584
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
<font color="yellow">all I can say is "I'm sorry."</font>

585
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,970
<font color="yellow">Since when were you there?</font>

586
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
<font color="yellow">Always.</font>

587
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,470
<font color="yellow">I've always been beside you.</font>

588
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,810
<font color="yellow">You just didn't know.</font>

589
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,710
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

590
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,140
<font color="yellow">I won't say that I'm sorry like an idiot.</font>

591
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,780
<font color="yellow">So that I don't have any regrets...</font>

592
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,570
<font color="yellow">when I leave.</font>

593
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,170
<font color="yellow">Isn't it hard to...</font>

594
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,470
<font color="yellow">live someone else's life?</font>

595
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,410
<font color="yellow">You say that you're Han Gi Tak's sister.</font>

596
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,710
<font color="yellow">You're lying, Hong Nan.</font>

597
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,670
<font color="yellow">Jung Ji Hoon.</font>

598
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,110
<font color="yellow">What does he know?</font>

599
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,940
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

600
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,240
<font color="yellow">Does he know who it is?</font>

601
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,230
<font color="yellow">So what did Jung Ji Hoon say?</font>

602
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,160
<font color="yellow">He knew Hong Nan was Gi Tak's sister.</font>

603
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,240
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

604
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,460
<font color="yellow">He's pretty good.</font>

605
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,630
<font color="yellow">We should take care of it before Cha Jae Gook finds out.</font>

606
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:55,670
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

607
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,860
<font color="yellow">If Mr Cha finds out,</font>

608
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,970
<font color="yellow">he'll be upset.</font>

609
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,210
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

610
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,170
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Sir.</font>

611
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,960
<font color="yellow">How did you know where I was?</font>

612
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,130
<font color="yellow">I told you not to scare me like that.</font>

613
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,340
