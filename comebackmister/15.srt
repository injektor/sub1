35
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,829

but I've never had a proper meal here.</font>

36
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,730
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

37
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,329
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Give me mine
back. I'll be fine eating it.</font>

38
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:05,530
<font color="yellow">I wanted to do that for you.
Go on and eat.</font>

39
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,429
<font color="yellow">How is it?
Is it good?</font>

40
00:07:56,829 --> 00:07:58,730
<font color="yellow">You're not eating?</font>

41
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,929
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat.</font>

42
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:04,472
<font color="yellow">But, you know...</font>

43
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,730
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see
me here, of all places?</font>

44
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:19,929
<font color="yellow">Because I was so thankful for the
warm meals that you made for me.</font>

45
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:24,329
<font color="yellow">So I wanted to buy you a
delicious dinner, at least once.</font>

46
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:30,929
<font color="yellow">Even though this is nothing compared
to all you've done for me.</font>

47
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:38,830
<font color="yellow">Also, because you
became my family.</font>

48
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,929
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

49
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,929
<font color="yellow">I wanted to be sure to tell you
these things, no matter what.</font>

50
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:11,330
<font color="yellow">I... feel great.
I kept my promise this time.</font>

51
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:25,731
<font color="yellow">- Um...
- Today, you...</font>

52
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,630
<font color="yellow">look so beautiful.</font>

53
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,330
<font color="yellow">Mr. Hae Joon!
Mr. Hae Joon!</font>

54
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:50,530
<font color="yellow">Hey, Honey!
Hey, wake up!</font>

55
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,429
<font color="yellow">What do we do,
Ms. Hong Nan?</font>

56
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:54,630
<font color="yellow">- Call the ambulance, now!
- Yes, ma'am!</font>

57
00:09:58,929 --> 00:09:59,929
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

58
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:03,130
<font color="yellow">I... got... hit by a car.</font>

59
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:14,929
<font color="yellow">- Will he be okay?
- Is the patient okay?</font>

60
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,231
<font color="yellow">Doctor!</font>

61
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:23,231
<font color="yellow">- What happened to him?
- It was a hit-and-run.</font>

62
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:25,330
<font color="yellow">Let's do a thorough
examination of him first.</font>

63
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,130
<font color="yellow">Please stay here.</font>

64
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:31,030
<font color="yellow">Why didn't he say something?</font>

65
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,530
<font color="yellow">- He'll be okay.
- Why does he do this?</font>

66
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,330
<font color="yellow">Why go through such great lengths?</font>

67
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,731
<font color="yellow">Round up the kids and find out
what the license plate was first.</font>

68
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:46,929
<font color="yellow">We're in a hurry,
so make sure you do it quickly.</font>

69
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:49,030
<font color="yellow">And call me as soon
as you find it out.</font>

70
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:51,731
<font color="yellow">Okay, got it.</font>

71
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,731
<font color="yellow">Are you just going to
let him die like this?</font>

72
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,630
<font color="yellow">It truly is a shame</font>

73
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,530
<font color="yellow">but it seems that Mr. Kim Young Soo
will be returning earlier than expected.</font>

74
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,030
<font color="yellow">What kind of bullshit is that?</font>

75
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,130
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard for him
to live past two days.</font>

76
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,231
<font color="yellow">Wait, you're not saying... that
he's going to die again, right?</font>

77
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:40,830
<font color="yellow">It can't be helped, as he
brought this upon himself.</font>

78
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,429
<font color="yellow">So you want him to
die like that, again?</font>

79
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:46,030
<font color="yellow">You're the one who made
him into Lee Hae Joon!</font>

80
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,330
<font color="yellow">Save him!
Now, damn it!</font>

81
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,231
<font color="yellow">I cannot do anything that interferes
with the life and death of humans.</font>

82
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:05,429
<font color="yellow">You should at least give them
time to say their goodbyes.</font>

83
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:11,130
<font color="yellow">Bring him back to life!
What can I do?</font>

84
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:16,231
<font color="yellow">I can't just let him die like this!</font>

85
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,130
<font color="yellow">- There is one way, but...
- And what is that?</font>

86
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,731
<font color="yellow">I'll do anything.</font>

87
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:39,030
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han Gi Tak. Can you share the
time you have left with Kim Young Soo?</font>

88
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,429
<font color="yellow">Please, please wake up already.</font>

89
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,830
<font color="yellow">If you don't,
I'll get mad at you!</font>

90
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:23,630
<font color="yellow">You said that you'd come
and go, like the wind.</font>

91
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:29,231
<font color="yellow">You can't do this to me.</font>

92
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:37,429
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and wake up,
and leave our house smiling!</font>

93
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,429
<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

94
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,130
<font color="yellow">Are... are you okay?</font>

95
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,231
<font color="yellow">I want to go home.</font>

96
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:47,929
<font color="yellow">I want to lie on my own blanket
and listen to Han Na chatter on</font>

97
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:51,030
<font color="yellow">and eat the food
you make for me.</font>

98
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,429
<font color="yellow">Yes, let's go.</font>

99
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,830
<font color="yellow">Where's the patient
that was just here?</font>

100
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,530
<font color="yellow">- He was discharged.
- What?</font>

101
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:18,231
<font color="yellow">- But he has a brain hemorrhage!
- What?</font>

102
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,731
<font color="yellow">Geez... just what kind of trouble
did this guy cause this time?</font>

103
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,731
<font color="yellow">- You're back?
- Yeah.</font>

104
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:53,130
<font color="yellow">- Geez, makes me so worried!
- What is it now?</font>

105
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,596
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook!</font>

106
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,501
<font color="yellow">He asked me to get dinner
with Young Chan and him</font>

107
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,330
<font color="yellow">but he wouldn't smile
or even talk in front of her.</font>

108
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,231
<font color="yellow">Geez, seriously.
Something's definitely off.</font>

109
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,730
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Gosh.</font>

110
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,580
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

111
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:11,730
<font color="yellow">Oh my, this is me!</font>

112
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,430
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?
I did this interview 10 years ago!</font>

113
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,130
<font color="yellow">Wow. Your older brother sure
did collect peculiar things.</font>

114
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,930
<font color="yellow">I don't know who
this lovely lady is</font>

115
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,680
<font color="yellow">but she sure was pretty
10 years ago</font>

116
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,430
<font color="yellow">and she still is now.</font>

117
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,730
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, right?</font>

118
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,730
<font color="yellow">She sure is.</font>

119
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:43,230
<font color="yellow">Sheesh... it's been far too long.
I look so young here!</font>

120
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:06,130
<font color="yellow">President Cha, it sure is a nice
change of pace to see you like this.</font>

121
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,529
<font color="yellow">Meeting under a suspicious bridge.
How suitable, really.</font>

122
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,529
<font color="yellow">I guess the thug life hasn't
been easy on you.</font>

123
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,930
<font color="yellow">That's why you're going
to save me now.</font>

124
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,329
<font color="yellow">We're on the same
boat, after all.</font>

125
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,430
<font color="yellow">- Give me "that" first.
- Ah.</font>

126
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,730
<font color="yellow">You mean, this?</font>

127
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,330
<font color="yellow"><i>Kill that piece of trash!</i></font>

128
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,930
<font color="yellow">Oh my, how surprising!</font>

129
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,529
<font color="yellow">Now you have to show me the funds.</font>

130
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,029
<font color="yellow">That'll have to be the
original recording.</font>

131
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:42,930
<font color="yellow">Of course it's the original.</font>

132
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:54,329
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Looks like you've
gotten yourself new buddies.</font>

133
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,730
<font color="yellow">An owner can't let
his crazy dog run amok.</font>

134
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,430
<font color="yellow">Crazy dog, eh?</font>

135
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:07,029
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah.
Did you hear?</font>

136
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:09,930
<font color="yellow">Here I was, doing
my crazy dog thing</font>

137
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,529
<font color="yellow">but he kept getting in
my way, so I ran him over.</font>

138
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:19,529
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about your rival,
Lee Hae Joon.</font>

139
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,730
<font color="yellow">What?
Lee Hae Joon?</font>

140
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,730
<font color="yellow">Why would I run him over,
you may ask.</font>

141
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,930
<font color="yellow">Well, that's because
you ordered me to.</font>

142
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,329
<font color="yellow">Just like how you told me
to kill Han Gi Tak.</font>

143
00:19:32,329 --> 00:19:35,130
<font color="yellow">So you killed him and you're
going to put the blame on me?</font>

144
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,130
<font color="yellow">I've been taking your
crap this whole time</font>

145
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,130
<font color="yellow">so I need some sort of insurance.</font>

146
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:44,730
<font color="yellow">You were the one who told me to kill
Han Gi Tak and Lee Hae Joon.</font>

147
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,130
<font color="yellow">You commanded me to
do all that. You did!</font>

148
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,930
<font color="yellow">Because we're
in the same boat.</font>

149
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,829
<font color="yellow">Wow, this son of a bitch.</font>

150
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:58,130
<font color="yellow">You dare try and blackmail me?</font>

151
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,930
<font color="yellow">You're laughing?</font>

152
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,529
<font color="yellow">Oh, ouch.
That hurts.</font>

153
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:19,029
<font color="yellow">You think I brought just that
without anything to defend myself with?</font>

154
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,430
<font color="yellow">Surprise!
Just you wait for it.</font>

155
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,930
<font color="yellow">Find him.
Find him!</font>

156
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,930
<font color="yellow">Go after him.
Hurry and find him!</font>

157
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,329
<font color="yellow">Damn this loach-ass bastard,
slipping away from me!</font>

158
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:43,630
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and find him!</font>

159
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,630
<font color="yellow">Find him!</font>

160
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,529
<font color="yellow"><i>[Hurry up and get better, Mister]</i></font>

161
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,029
<font color="yellow">Oh no, that'll leave a scar.</font>

162
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,930
<font color="yellow">Good morning,
Middle-Aged Lady.</font>

163
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:58,430
<font color="yellow">- Are you all better now?
- Yep.</font>

164
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,130
<font color="yellow">I feel like I've made
a complete recovery.</font>

165
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,730
<font color="yellow">That's a relief.
Come downstairs and eat.</font>

166
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,029
<font color="yellow">It felt like someone kept on taking
care of me in my dreams.</font>

167
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,430
<font color="yellow">Here you go.
Thank you.</font>

168
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,329
<font color="yellow">Did you hear me ask for a sticker?</font>

169
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,130
<font color="yellow">Oh, Ms. Maya!
I think the watch is broken!</font>

170
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,630
<font color="yellow">The time I have left here
decreased by a ton!</font>

171
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,430
<font color="yellow">- It's not that it's broken.
- What? What do you mean?</font>

172
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:58,430
<font color="yellow">It's not that your time has decreased.</font>

173
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,430
<font color="yellow">It's actually increased.
That's all I'll say.</font>

174
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,730
<font color="yellow">Say it in a way
that I'll understand!</font>

175
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,930
<font color="yellow">You'll find out when
you come back.</font>

176
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,029
<font color="yellow">Just make sure you take care
of everything you need to.</font>

177
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:11,730
<font color="yellow">This isn't nearly enough time!</font>

178
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,430
<font color="yellow">It's like that for everyone.</font>

179
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:31,230
<font color="yellow">I'm curious what your plan was for
acting oblivious this whole time.</font>

180
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,730
<font color="yellow">It was to the point where I wondered if
you really were the Lee Hae Joon I know.</font>

181
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:38,029
<font color="yellow">I couldn't trust you completely.</font>

182
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,230
<font color="yellow">I believe that you said something
similar before, as well.</font>

183
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,730
<font color="yellow">I'm not exactly
a trusting person.</font>

184
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,230
<font color="yellow">Lee Hae Joon, the leader of
the Sunjin revitalization project.</font>

185
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,529
<font color="yellow">The Chairman was
your official guardian, but</font>

186
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,829
<font color="yellow">the one who protected a motherless boy
like he was his own was someone else.</font>

187
00:24:53,829 --> 00:25:00,130
<font color="yellow">And that was the Chairman's executive
secretary, which was my father.</font>

188
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,730
<font color="yellow"><i>I didn't expect that at all.</i></font>

189
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,630
<font color="yellow">I wanted to confirm the
results of his efforts</font>

190
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,230
<font color="yellow">for the sake of Sunjin's
future, for myself.</font>

191
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:13,829
<font color="yellow">Right now, there's a game going on that
is leaving you at a disadvantage.</font>

192
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:18,529
<font color="yellow">May I help you now?</font>

193
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:29,829
<font color="yellow">if I want to stop the department store
from being sold</font>

194
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:33,130
<font color="yellow">I have to become the real Lee Hae Joon.</font>

195
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,430
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- Goodbye!</font>

196
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:39,430
<font color="yellow">- Oh, hello!
- Hey there, friend.</font>

197
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:42,430
<font color="yellow">I came to raise
your sales for you!</font>

198
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:45,329
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

199
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:55,730
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong Nan was at the pub.
She's not your manager anymore?</font>

200
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,430
<font color="yellow">That pub was originally
her older brother's.</font>

201
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,728
<font color="yellow">I've heard that, yes.</font>

202
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,430
<font color="yellow">She said that she learned
from him when she was younger</font>

203
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,730
<font color="yellow">and even taught me a few moves.</font>

204
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,230
<font color="yellow">Her older brother was
originally the chef there</font>

205
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,930
<font color="yellow">but he was a skilled
fighter back in the day, too.</font>

206
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:23,329
<font color="yellow">You must have been
close with him, too.</font>

207
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:31,529
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak.
That's his name.</font>

208
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,730
<font color="yellow">Han... Gi Tak?</font>

209
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:43,730
<font color="yellow">I really liked him a lot,
but he died.</font>

210
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,130
<font color="yellow">And now, his men are protecting me.</font>

211
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,430
<font color="yellow">They're so wonderful to me.</font>

212
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,130
<font color="yellow">Are you all right,
Ms. Da Hye?</font>

213
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,029
<font color="yellow">Yes.
I'm fine.</font>

214
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:18,529
<font color="yellow">How strange.
Why am I reacting this way?</font>

215
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:29,029
<font color="yellow">Branch Manager!
Have you seen this?</font>

216
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:33,730
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.
Oh me, oh my!</font>

217
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,029
<font color="yellow">Yes. The preparations to sell the
store are going well, correct?</font>

218
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,529
<font color="yellow">Make sure you manage
the directors until the end</font>

219
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:53,730
<font color="yellow">so that the sale can
be finalized this time.</font>

220
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,230
<font color="yellow">Are you the one whose voice
was recorded and put online</font>

221
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,930
<font color="yellow">where the person was ordering a murder?</font>

222
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,130
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

223
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,230
<font color="yellow">Rumor says you're the one
that ordered a man named</font>

224
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,230
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak killed.
Word is spreading fast.</font>

225
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,829
<font color="yellow">Stop it with your nonsense.</font>

226
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,529
<font color="yellow">Which bastard sullied my name when I
have such an important deal coming up?</font>

227
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,029
<font color="yellow">The police are on the
move right now, too.</font>

228
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,730
<font color="yellow">Big trouble, sir!</font>

229
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,329
<font color="yellow">If this is true,
I can no longer help you.</font>

230
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,829
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?
Did something happen?</font>

231
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:55,730
<font color="yellow">Um... are you all right?</font>

232
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,329
<font color="yellow"><i>I think this voice file is
talking about our Boss Gi Tak!</i></font>

233
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,130
<font color="yellow"><i>What should I do,
President?</i></font>

234
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,529
<font color="yellow"><i>These nasty bastards.</i></font>

235
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,930
<font color="yellow"><i>Then, shall we do as we
planned, to Han Gi Tak, and--</i></font>

236
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,930
<font color="yellow"><i>Kill him! That piece
of human trash!</i></font>

237
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,730
<font color="yellow"><i>- Then, I'll do it, as planned.
- Oh my gosh!</i></font>

238
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,829
<font color="yellow">You know, I saw that too.
Isn't that this store's President?</font>

239
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:22,730
<font color="yellow"><i>- Oh, no way!
- Kill him!</i></font>

240
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,430
<font color="yellow"><i>That piece of human trash!</i></font>

241
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,430
<font color="yellow"><i>- Oh my!
- Then, I'll do it, as planned.</i></font>

242
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,730
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak.</font>

243
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,029
<font color="yellow"><i>Kill him!</i></font>

244
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:30,329
<font color="yellow"><i>That piece of human trash!</i></font>

245
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,430
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook.</font>

246
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,029
<font color="yellow">- Oh my!
- The President? Really?</font>

247
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:44,130
<font color="yellow">Um, Ms. Da Hye.
I'm sorry. I have to go.</font>

248
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,329
<font color="yellow">Are you all right,
Ms. Lee Yeon?</font>

249
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:53,029
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'll be sure to
come back next time.</font>

250
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,730
<font color="yellow"><i>Kill him! That piece of
human trash!</i></font>

251
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,430
<font color="yellow">You killed Han Gi Tak?</font>

252
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,430
<font color="yellow">Just who is spreading
around this nonsense?</font>

253
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:12,029
<font color="yellow">- Did you cause his death?
- I'm Cha Jae Gook.</font>

254
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,130
<font color="yellow">Why would I be so afraid of
some thug that I'd kill him?</font>

255
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,130
<font color="yellow">I'll kill everyone who goes around
spouting nonsense like that!</font>

256
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,730
<font color="yellow">Yeah, it had better not be you.
Because if it is...</font>

257
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,130
<font color="yellow">I'll destroy you.</font>

258
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,730
<font color="yellow">Good. Now you're finally showing
your true colors, Lee Hae Joon.</font>

259
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:37,630
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to make you feel the pain
of the people you've trampled on.</font>

260
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,529
<font color="yellow">- It can't be.
- Song Lee Yeon.</font>

261
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:05,130
<font color="yellow">No matter what a terrible man he is...
he wouldn't have done this.</font>

262
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,730
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan, I'm sorry. I have something
else I have to do today.</font>

263
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,730
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

264
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,329
<font color="yellow">Did you hear it?</font>

265
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,430
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook and Na Suk Chul...
those bastards killed...</font>

266
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,130
<font color="yellow">- Follow Song Lee Yeon.
- She's not important right now!</font>

267
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,730
<font color="yellow">Your older brother
was murdered!</font>

268
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,430
<font color="yellow">- I'm begging you.
- Han Hong Nan!</font>

269
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,029
<font color="yellow">Think about what
Han Gi Tak would want.</font>

270
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,230
<font color="yellow">Are you okay,
Ms. Hong Nan?</font>

271
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,930
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to say.</font>

272
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,230
<font color="yellow">Here.
Are you alright?</font>

273
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,630
<font color="yellow">No. I'm not
alright at all.</font>

274
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,730
<font color="yellow">I didn't exactly live as
a goody two-shoes</font>

275
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,829
<font color="yellow">but I didn't live such a bad life</font>

276
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:20,930
<font color="yellow">that someone would
want to kill me, right?</font>

277
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,730
<font color="yellow">Geez, why are you
saying such things...</font>

278
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,529
<font color="yellow">I cast my family aside and
hurt the woman I loved.</font>

279
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,730
<font color="yellow">Is that why I was punished this way?</font>

280
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:37,029
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll be sure to uncover
who was responsible for sure, so--</font>

281
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:42,130
<font color="yellow">No. Instead of doing that, stay by
my Hong Nan's side a bit longer.</font>

282
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,329
<font color="yellow">She asked me if I was okay.</font>

283
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:54,829
<font color="yellow">Even though I'm the one who's
so sorry for having died like that.</font>

284
00:32:54,829 --> 00:33:07,329
<font color="yellow">I can't be by her side, so be by her
and protect her in my stead.</font>

285
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,230
<font color="yellow">Even if you have to do so for the
remainder of your time here.</font>

286
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:15,529
<font color="yellow">I promise I will.</font>

287
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:20,730
<font color="yellow">I'll use all the time I have
left to be by her side.</font>

288
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:32,930
<font color="yellow"><i>Han Gi Tak.
That's his name.</i></font>

289
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,529
<font color="yellow"><i>I told you that only crybabies cry
just about anywhere, right?</i></font>

290
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:38,029
<font color="yellow"><i>You're so cool,
my Little Sis.</i></font>

291
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,730
<font color="yellow"><i>- Where are you going?
- Ms. Da Hye.</i></font>

292
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,230
<font color="yellow">Ms. Da Hye?</font>

293
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:52,529
<font color="yellow">Um, did you have a bad
dream or something?</font>

294
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,529
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm just
having a hard time.</font>

295
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:04,729
<font color="yellow">It's so strange. Why do I feel like
something bad is going to happen?</font>

296
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:10,928
<font color="yellow">- Can I ask you a favor?
- Go ahead.</font>

297
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:16,928
<font color="yellow">Even if you leave, don't leave
without saying anything.</font>

298
00:34:16,928 --> 00:34:22,131
<font color="yellow">You have to say goodbye
before you leave, okay?</font>

299
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:27,031
<font color="yellow">Okay.
I promise I will.</font>

300
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:58,229
<font color="yellow">So you've finally made
your appearance.</font>

301
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:03,531
<font color="yellow">Did you really...
do that?</font>

302
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:10,830
<font color="yellow">Did you really tell him
to kill Han Gi Tak?</font>

303
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:14,330
<font color="yellow">How many years has it been since
you've come into this room?</font>

304
00:35:15,131 --> 00:35:17,031
<font color="yellow">But this is what you came
in here to say, huh?</font>

305
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:22,428
<font color="yellow">You didn't, right?
You didn't. You didn't, right?</font>

306
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:25,729
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and tell me.
You didn't, right?</font>

307
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:28,229
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and tell me
that you didn't do it!</font>

308
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:35,531
<font color="yellow">You can't have done it!
No! No! No! No!</font>

309
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:38,428
<font color="yellow">Yes, I killed him.</font>

310
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,131
<font color="yellow">I was the one who had him killed.</font>

311
00:35:41,131 --> 00:35:44,729
<font color="yellow">I told them to shred him apart so that
there wasn't a piece of him left!</font>

312
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,229
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

313
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:57,531
<font color="yellow">- No... tell me it isn't true!
- No, no!</font>

314
00:35:59,729 --> 00:36:06,830
<font color="yellow">I killed him. Why, you ask?
Because of you, Song Lee Yeon...</font>

315
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,928
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

316
00:36:57,531 --> 00:37:03,031
<font color="yellow">Where are you, punk? You don't
have time to be doing this to me.</font>

317
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:23,229
<font color="yellow">Are you going to see
the prosecutors?</font>

318
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:25,830
<font color="yellow">- Huh?
- President.</font>

319
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,428
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't a more formal outfit
be better suited for this?</font>

320
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:32,729
<font color="yellow">Why? It's not like
I did anything wrong.</font>

321
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:40,531
<font color="yellow">Oh, come on in.</font>

322
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,131
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

323
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:49,031
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook is being investigated right
now as a potential perp for the crime.</font>

324
00:37:49,031 --> 00:37:53,428
<font color="yellow">But Jung Ji Hoon and
Choi Seung Jae both said</font>

325
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:56,928
<font color="yellow">that there were many mysterious
aspects about your death.</font>

326
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:59,631
<font color="yellow">So I decided to look
into it again, myself.</font>

327
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:02,729
<font color="yellow">The truth behind
Han Gi Tak's death, huh?</font>

328
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,229
<font color="yellow">All right, lay it on me.</font>

329
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:14,131
<font color="yellow">Okay, first: the black box camera in your
car that should've been at the scene.</font>

330
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:16,531
<font color="yellow">Secondly, the driving patterns of the
paparazzi and the truck driver.</font>

331
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:20,830
<font color="yellow">They were both quite suspicious.
And thirdly, they did this</font>

332
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,131
<font color="yellow">in a place where there were no CCTVs
to see what happened.</font>

333
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:26,531
<font color="yellow">- So?
- So!</font>

334
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,729
<font color="yellow">What is it that we need?</font>

335
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,428
<font color="yellow">Our brains.</font>

336
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,729
<font color="yellow">Let's go through the accident again,
using your memories of the night.</font>

337
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,928
<font color="yellow"><i>- Yes, Seung Jae. Let's talk later.
- What happened, sir?</i></font>

338
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:49,428
<font color="yellow"><i>The police are even at the
restaurant right now.</i></font>

339
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,729
<font color="yellow"><i>- What?
- They're making a fuss, looking for you.</i></font>

340
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,928
<font color="yellow"><i>What are they talking about?
Physical assault?</i></font>

341
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,131
<font color="yellow"><i>What, exactly, is--</i></font>

342
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:58,928
<font color="yellow"><i>So they're starting with me, eh?
All right, bring it on!</i></font>

343
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:08,330
<font color="yellow"><i>Han Gi Tak was in the middle of
chasing down a paparazzi's car</i></font>

344
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,131
<font color="yellow"><i>to clear Song Lee Yeon's name.</i></font>

345
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,131
<font color="yellow"><i>He also knew that there had been
an assault incident with Yoo Hyuk</i></font>

346
00:39:12,131 --> 00:39:16,131
<font color="yellow"><i>and that he'd been
caught in someone's trap.</i></font>

347
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:36,330
<font color="yellow"><i>So he followed the paparazzi
who'd followed Song Lee Yeon</i></font>

348
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,031
<font color="yellow"><i>and then the first phase
of the accident happened.</i></font>

349
00:39:55,928 --> 00:40:01,531
<font color="yellow"><i>And the second phase of the accident
was when the truck hit Han Gi Tak</i></font>

350
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:04,229
<font color="yellow">and thus, ensuring that that he'd
be crossing over to the next world.</font>

351
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:07,928
<font color="yellow">You don't remember anything about that?
Like, anything strange that stood out.</font>

352
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:09,729
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not sure.</font>

353
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:13,229
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it...</font>

354
00:40:13,229 --> 00:40:17,131
<font color="yellow"><i>What's this?
"Purgatory?"</i></font>

355
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,428
<font color="yellow"><i>There was a cigarette
in my pocket.</i></font>

356
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,031
<font color="yellow"><i>And just what
the hell is this?</i></font>

357
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:27,631
<font color="yellow"><i>Even though it'd been quite
a while since I'd quit smoking.</i></font>

358
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:41,330
<font color="yellow"><i>You okay, Mister?
Hey, Mister.</i></font>

359
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:45,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Is he dead or alive?</i></font>

360
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:52,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Hey, Mister!
Is he dead?</i></font>

361
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:10,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Here you are, sir.</i></font>

362
00:41:10,428 --> 00:41:11,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Go on, now.</i></font>

363
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:28,031
<font color="yellow"><i>What should I do, sir?</i></font>

364
00:41:33,729 --> 00:41:36,729
<font color="yellow"><i>- Disgusting scum.
- Then, shall we do as planned and kill--</i></font>

365
00:41:36,729 --> 00:41:39,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Kill Han Gi Tak!
This piece of human trash!</i></font>

366
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:42,428
<font color="yellow"><i>Only do as we'd planned,
without any issues.</i></font>

367
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:46,729
<font color="yellow"><i>When he said "kill him,"
it was merely in a fit of anger.</i></font>

368
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,428
<font color="yellow"><i>His original plan was to lock
Song Lee Yeon up with the scandal.</i></font>

369
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:54,928
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, I'll be sure to take care of
Han Gi Tak without any issues.</i></font>

370
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:59,531
<font color="yellow"><i>[Cha Jae Gook:
Recording]</i></font>

371
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:20,928
<font color="yellow"><i>Good work. Get some
good rest now. Later.</i></font>

372
00:42:22,428 --> 00:42:24,620
<font color="yellow"><i>Na Suk Chul, that bastard.</i></font>

373
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:29,928
<font color="yellow"><i>He used Cha Jae Gook
to kill Han Gi Tak?</i></font>

374
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:35,729
<font color="yellow">What a pitiful bastard.</font>

375
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:37,729
<font color="yellow">He'll burn in the pits of hell.</font>

376
00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:44,031
<font color="yellow">The one who did the hit-and-run
was Na Suk Chul, too.</font>

377
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:47,928
<font color="yellow">So it was Na Suk Chul, huh?
What does he want, exactly?</font>

378
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:51,531
<font color="yellow">He killed the Big Boss, who was like
his parent, as well as his friend.</font>

379
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:53,928
<font color="yellow">The only thing he cares
about is money.</font>

380
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,928
<font color="yellow">Now, he has nothing
left to lose.</font>

381
00:42:57,928 --> 00:43:02,729
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook ended up this way, too,
so Na Suk Chul's last hope is...</font>

382
00:43:03,729 --> 00:43:05,229
<font color="yellow">the secret funds?</font>

383
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:11,031
<font color="yellow">Until Na Suk Chul is good and dead,
Han Gi Tak's little sister must be me.</font>

384
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:13,229
<font color="yellow">No matter what.</font>

385
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,131
<font color="yellow">Will they be okay?</font>

386
00:43:16,131 --> 00:43:23,428
<font color="yellow">If we go back like this,
will Da Hye and Lee Yeon be okay?</font>

387
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:28,031
<font color="yellow">I have to hurry up and catch
Na Suk Chul while I'm still here.</font>

388
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:39,631
<font color="yellow">What the heck?
Why is it different than mine?</font>

389
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,631
<font color="yellow">- Why do you have so little time left?
- What are you talking about?</font>

390
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:42,729
<font color="yellow">What did you do?</font>

391
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:45,381
<font color="yellow"><i>Your time hasn't decreased.
It has increased.</i></font>

392
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:48,031
<font color="yellow"><i>That's all I'll say.</i></font>

393
00:43:51,229 --> 00:43:55,229
<font color="yellow">Did you, by any chance,
give your time to me?</font>

394
00:43:55,229 --> 00:43:58,428
<font color="yellow">She said that you didn't
even have two days left.</font>

395
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:02,729
<font color="yellow">It was for my little sister's sake.</font>

396
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,131
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on, you.</font>

397
00:44:14,131 --> 00:44:18,531
<font color="yellow">I told you, be good to your wife
if you have time do be doing this.</font>

398
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,729
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- Geez, how pathetic.</font>

399
00:45:00,729 --> 00:45:02,928
<font color="yellow">- Pathetic?
- Pathetic?</font>

400
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:06,229
<font color="yellow">I want to forget so badly, but I can't.
So what am I supposed to do?</font>

401
00:45:06,229 --> 00:45:10,330
<font color="yellow">I want to just rip it out of
my heart, but I can't!</font>

402
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:14,031
<font color="yellow">And they keep wandering around me,
to the point I want to claw my eyes out.</font>

403
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:15,729
<font color="yellow">You call that pathetic?</font>

404
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:18,928
<font color="yellow">I'm the most pathetic
person in the world.</font>

405
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:30,631
<font color="yellow">I wish you could've been
here with me too, Gi Tak.</font>

406
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:40,031
<font color="yellow">Your younger sister grew up
to be so pretty and strong.</font>

407
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:44,229
<font color="yellow">It would've been so nice if
we both could have seen her.</font>

408
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,729
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak?</font>

409
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:13,531
<font color="yellow">Oh my. Wow!</font>

410
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:23,031
<font color="yellow">My wish came true.</font>

411
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:29,131
<font color="yellow">And here I was, wishing I had
a photo that we'd taken together.</font>

412
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:38,330
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Gi Tak.</font>

413
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:48,229
<font color="yellow">I did whatever I wanted, and then
couldn't help but want to see you</font>

414
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:53,031
<font color="yellow">and then went to seek you out,
like a selfish woman.</font>

415
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,729
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

416
00:46:57,031 --> 00:47:03,631
<font color="yellow">I knew that you'd never
be able to forget me</font>

417
00:47:03,631 --> 00:47:11,131
<font color="yellow">and yet I kept telling you to
forget me and to piss off.</font>

418
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:21,428
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for loving you.</font>

419
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:30,729
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

420
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,330
<font color="yellow">Song Lee Yeon.</font>

421
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:50,928
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.
No need to be sorry.</font>

422
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:55,031
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Goo isn't the one
who did that to Han Gi Tak</font>

423
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:58,729
<font color="yellow">so there's no need for
you to feel guilty.</font>

424
00:48:00,928 --> 00:48:06,729
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that Cha Jae Gook
feels totally drained right now.</font>

425
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:11,928
<font color="yellow">So you have to take
good care of Young Chan.</font>

426
00:48:11,928 --> 00:48:13,830
<font color="yellow">Isn't that right?</font>

427
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:19,729
<font color="yellow">That's what I came here to say.
I'll be going now, then.</font>

428
00:48:29,229 --> 00:48:35,131
<font color="yellow">Show me your face, won't you?
I have to leave soon.</font>

429
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:40,729
<font color="yellow">I've done all I had to
do here, after all.</font>

430
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:16,928
<font color="yellow"><i>[The 15th Sunjin Shareholders' Meeting]</i></font>

431
00:49:16,928 --> 00:49:18,729
<font color="yellow">President!</font>

432
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:24,229
<font color="yellow">Oh my. It's been a
while, directors.</font>

433
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:27,928
<font color="yellow">I heard quite a strange thing
through the grapevine.</font>

434
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:30,631
<font color="yellow">Apparently, one new topic up for
discussion has been added in.</font>

435
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:43,928
<font color="yellow">Number One!
The termination of the President.</font>

436
00:49:43,928 --> 00:49:46,729
<font color="yellow">Number Two: Regarding the
selling of the department store...</font>

437
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,928
<font color="yellow">Do you really think
Number One will happen?</font>

438
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:56,928
<font color="yellow">But... I do wonder whose
bright idea this was?</font>

439
00:49:57,729 --> 00:50:01,180
<font color="yellow">Was it you? Or was it you?</font>

440
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,631
<font color="yellow">Which bastard dared to try and fire me?</font>

441
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:08,928
<font color="yellow">It was me.
I did it.</font>

442
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:13,928
<font color="yellow">Lee Hae Joon.
What right do you have to--</font>

443
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:18,229
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm only the
majority shareholder.</font>

444
00:50:18,229 --> 00:50:19,928
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

445
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:22,031
<font color="yellow">I bought them out bit by bit</font>

446
00:50:22,031 --> 00:50:25,928
<font color="yellow">all thanks to you making the
stock worth next to nothing.</font>

447
00:50:25,928 --> 00:50:29,531
<font color="yellow"><i>Wouldn't 4.9 percent
be sufficient?</i></font>

448
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,729
<font color="yellow">Covering up an employee's death
from being overworked as suicide.</font>

449
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:37,729
<font color="yellow">Trying to cover up
a bribery scheme.</font>

450
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:40,830
<font color="yellow">Trying to cover up our decrease in
sales by renovating the store.</font>

451
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,729
<font color="yellow">Using company funds to
fund private investments.</font>

452
00:50:43,729 --> 00:50:45,294
<font color="yellow">Ruining our image with
your dating scandal.</font>

453
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:47,729
<font color="yellow">Having shown that you're a
risk to our company many times over</font>

454
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:49,729
<font color="yellow">our Sunjin Department's
position is becoming quite shaky.</font>

455
00:50:49,729 --> 00:50:51,019
<font color="yellow">No matter the situation</font>

456
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:53,729
<font color="yellow">the company and owner
must be separate entities, and</font>

457
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:57,928
<font color="yellow">we must establish a firm foundation
so that Sunjin will no longer be shaky.</font>

458
00:50:57,928 --> 00:51:02,928
<font color="yellow">And with that in mind, I propose the
termination of President Cha.</font>

459
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:08,428
<font color="yellow">Father. You sure did
raise a great son.</font>

460
00:51:08,428 --> 00:51:12,531
<font color="yellow">You must be real happy,
as one of the two ended up all right.</font>

461
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:16,631
<font color="yellow">We'll now be discussing the
termination of President Cha.</font>

462
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:19,428
<font color="yellow">Okay, we'll do it with
a show of hands.</font>

463
00:51:19,428 --> 00:51:23,928
<font color="yellow">Those in favor of terminating him,
please raise your hand.</font>

464
00:51:36,729 --> 00:51:42,330
<font color="yellow">Due to a unanimous vote,
President Cha has now been terminated.</font>

465
00:51:47,131 --> 00:51:53,428
<font color="yellow">For the time being, Lee Hae Joon will
take over the position of President.</font>

466
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:57,131
<font color="yellow">What a great decision!</font>

467
00:52:12,031 --> 00:52:15,729
<font color="yellow">- It was for the sake of the company.
- Is this your way of comforting me?</font>

468
00:52:15,729 --> 00:52:18,729
<font color="yellow">I know that you didn't actually
intend to kill Han Gi Tak.</font>

469
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:21,729
<font color="yellow">Piss off.</font>

470
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:37,229
<font color="yellow">In the end, you managed to
acquire the department store.</font>

471
00:52:37,229 --> 00:52:40,830
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- But, um...</font>

472
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,229
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to meet at a
place like this? It's so awkward.</font>

473
00:52:43,229 --> 00:52:46,031
<font color="yellow">- We're... going to see Da Hye.
- What?</font>

474
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:50,428
<font color="yellow">Sit down.
I know you want to see her.</font>

475
00:52:50,428 --> 00:52:52,631
<font color="yellow">The one who wanted to meet
in the first place is Da Hye.</font>

476
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:53,631
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

477
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,830
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong Nan!</font>

478
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:07,830
<font color="yellow">I found these while I was cleaning
the Branch Manager's room.</font>

479
00:53:08,729 --> 00:53:14,729
<font color="yellow">This kid is definitely me.
But I don't understand any of this.</font>

480
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:18,729
<font color="yellow">Please tell me...
how do you have this?</font>

481
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:24,330
<font color="yellow">The truth is... we've found
your older brother.</font>

482
00:53:26,928 --> 00:53:32,428
<font color="yellow">But I can't tell you that person's name,
age, or even where they live.</font>

483
00:53:32,428 --> 00:53:37,330
<font color="yellow">He doesn't want that.
He can't appear before you</font>

484
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,530
<font color="yellow">but one thing is for certain.</font>

485
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,729
<font color="yellow">He loved you very much</font>

486
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:46,229
<font color="yellow">and wanted to protect you,
which is why he left you behind.</font>

487
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:52,874
<font color="yellow">Is my older brother...</font>

488
00:53:55,050 --> 00:53:57,229
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak?</font>

490
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:26,531
<font color="yellow">It's too far.</font>

491
00:54:34,031 --> 00:54:36,729
<font color="yellow">Whatever.
No need to look.</font>

492
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:51,229

It's here!</font>
