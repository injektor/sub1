53
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,220
<font color="yellow">If I give it to her now, she might get sad.</font>

54

<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

55
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,110
<font color="yellow">Are you going to deduct it from Mum's debt?</font>

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,950
<font color="yellow">I wonder who you take after.</font>

57

<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,810
<font color="yellow">No wonder you have enough money to loan to people.</font>

62
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,010
<font color="yellow">No, I don't loan money.</font>

63
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,400
<font color="yellow">Have you ever seen a loan shark this handsome?</font>

64

- Mum.</font>

68

<font color="yellow">If that's not the problem, then what is?</font>

70
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,110
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

71

<font color="yellow">You're awesome.</font>

81
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,910
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

82
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,080
<font color="yellow">Cha Jae Gook made up Yi Yeon's scandal.</font>

83
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,480
<font color="yellow">You became the store manager overnight.</font>

84
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,910
<font color="yellow">I sure am glad you're my friend.</font>

85
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,910
<font color="yellow">This is the place.</font>

86
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,910
<font color="yellow">It's where I took my last breath.</font>

87
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,210
<font color="yellow">That must've hurt.</font>

88
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,810
<font color="yellow">Actually, I don't remember...</font>

89
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,310
<font color="yellow">whether I was hurt,</font>

90
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,910
<font color="yellow">sad...</font>

91

<font color="yellow">or scared.</font>

92
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,490
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were hurt, sad and scared...</font>

93
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,010
<font color="yellow">just like me.</font>

94
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,910
<font color="yellow">I feel that way now.</font>

95
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,380
<font color="yellow">My daughter...</font>

96
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,710
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I might make her cry again.</font>

97

<font color="yellow">She's pretty...</font>

101
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,550
<font color="yellow">like her mum.</font>

102
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,210

<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

108
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,820
<font color="yellow">was the world we lived in...</font>

<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

112
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,410
<font color="yellow">Father,</font>

113
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,580
<font color="yellow">he was here yesterday.</font>

114
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,210
<font color="yellow">Who was here yesterday?</font>

115
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,550
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

116
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,910
<font color="yellow">Yesterday feels like the day before it.</font>

117
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,710
<font color="yellow">And the day before yesterday feels like yesterday.</font>

118
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,010
<font color="yellow">Have dinner before you go, Mr Moneylender.</font>

119
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,910
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

120
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,580
<font color="yellow">think the same way?</font>

121
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,710
<font color="yellow">Do you think it was suicide?</font>

122
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,280
<font color="yellow">Do you really believe that?</font>

123
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,710
<font color="yellow">The circumstances were...</font>

124
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,410
<font color="yellow">Do you believe it wasn't suicide or do you want to believe it wasn't?</font>

125
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,210
<font color="yellow">What difference does it make?</font>

126
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,450
<font color="yellow">A dead man tells no tales.</font>

127
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,550
<font color="yellow">A dead man tells no tales.</font>

128
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,380
<font color="yellow">That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.</font>

129
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,020
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

130
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,910
<font color="yellow">You're blocking my way.</font>

131
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,410
<font color="yellow">I have no place to sleep.</font>

132
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,910
<font color="yellow">I'm asking to stay in your room not in Yi Yeon's room.</font>

133
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,610
<font color="yellow">Why won't you let me stay?</font>

134
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,910
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

135
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,510
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense. You better go home...</font>

136
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,810
<font color="yellow">before it gets ugly.</font>

137
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,880
<font color="yellow">I am not talking nonsense.</font>

138
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,580
<font color="yellow">You getting a circumcision in middle school was what got ugly.</font>

139
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,450
<font color="yellow">Why would Boss...</font>

140
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,490
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak said...</font>

141
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,610
<font color="yellow">What else did he say?</font>

142
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,380
<font color="yellow">He said you would never betray him...</font>

143
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:24,350
<font color="yellow">even if everyone else in this world does.</font>

144
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,350
<font color="yellow">"Today, I saw Song Yi Yeon in Sunjin Department Store."</font>

145
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,590
<font color="yellow">"She was flirting with her ex-lover in front of her ex-husband."</font>

146
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,710
<font color="yellow">"I think she is crazy."</font>

147
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,210
<font color="yellow">"She's coming out with a movie. An erotic movie would be perfect."</font>

148
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,020
<font color="yellow">"She can't live without men."</font>

149
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,210
<font color="yellow">"Her poor son..."</font>

150
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,310
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

151
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,550
<font color="yellow">Why? There are 600 more.</font>

152
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,850
<font color="yellow">So please...</font>

155
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,410
<font color="yellow">why did you act up?</font>

<font color="yellow">And barking up.</font>

159
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,810
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

160
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,210
<font color="yellow">Shall I call you...</font>

161
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,310
<font color="yellow">a slave instead?</font>

162
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:27,180
<font color="yellow">I know you work for him.</font>

163
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,610
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

164
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,210
<font color="yellow">We get paid from the same man.</font>

165
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,810
<font color="yellow">So let's be polite to each other.</font>

166
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,550
<font color="yellow">Don't make me pop in and out. It's tiring.</font>

167
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,450
<font color="yellow">You got this big house. You're fed well and dressed nicely.</font>

168
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,110
<font color="yellow">Who'd put down...</font>

169
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,450
<font color="yellow">that much money for a has-been actress?</font>

170
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,180
<font color="yellow">- Then...
- The investor is...</font>

171
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,710
<font color="yellow">very upset in many ways.</font>

172
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,910
<font color="yellow">The dead man is dragging down a living person.</font>

173
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,710
<font color="yellow">I'm so upset.</font>

174
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,820
<font color="yellow">Send your son to his father.</font>

175
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,820
<font color="yellow">- Live freely and act...
- Let me go.</font>

176
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,310
<font color="yellow">Let this go or I'll kill you.</font>

177
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,710
<font color="yellow">Who's that?</font>

178
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,310
<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul.</font>

179
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,210
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

180
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,800
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Sir.</font>

181
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,710
<font color="yellow">This is my sister whom I told you about.</font>

182
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,210
<font color="yellow">I told her now, but she begged to at least run errands.</font>

183
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,080
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Let go of me!</font>

184
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,410
<font color="yellow">Are you the president...</font>

185
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,710
<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul?</font>

186
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,110
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

187
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,100
<font color="yellow">Would you like some coffee?</font>

188
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,810
<font color="yellow">Naturally.</font>

189
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,510
<font color="yellow">These are the offers that came in.</font>

190
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,710
<font color="yellow">One has a nude scene.</font>

191
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,980
<font color="yellow">And the other is an adult movie.</font>

192
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,410
<font color="yellow">Which one do you want?</font>

193
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,590
<font color="yellow">You should be grateful...</font>

194
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,210
<font color="yellow">and do as you're told, okay?</font>

195
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,310
<font color="yellow">Stop being obvious that you're a thug...</font>

196
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,710
<font color="yellow">and stay out of it.</font>

197
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,310
<font color="yellow">I'll take care of my own business.</font>

198
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,910
<font color="yellow">What will I ever do about that confidence of yours?</font>

199
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,810
<font color="yellow">It tastes good.</font>

200
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:50,300
<font color="yellow">I'll work like a dog and pay back your money...</font>

201
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="yellow">and leave this dump.</font>

202
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,600
<font color="yellow">Please do.</font>

203
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,210
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

204
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,780
<font color="yellow">You drink...</font>

205
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,610
<font color="yellow">way too much.</font>

206
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,810
<font color="yellow">You're too weak.</font>

207
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,710
<font color="yellow">There's a meeting with producers tomorrow.</font>

208
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,710
<font color="yellow">They're working on something with Director Bong Soon Wook.</font>

209
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,950
<font color="yellow">I'm not ready yet,</font>

210
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,910
<font color="yellow">but they insist it must be me.</font>

211
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,210
<font color="yellow">How do I look?</font>

212
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,020
<font color="yellow">Am I a big mess?</font>

213
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,710
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

214
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,110
<font color="yellow">not so much that you're unrecognisable.</font>

215
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,980
<font color="yellow">I gained 5kg after having a kid.</font>

216
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,080
<font color="yellow">I'll look huge on screen.</font>

217
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,710
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

218
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,350
<font color="yellow">what's your name again?</font>

219
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,110
<font color="yellow">Hong...</font>

220
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,410
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan.</font>

221
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,910
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan?</font>

222
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,350
<font color="yellow">Han Hong Nan.</font>

223
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,810
<font color="yellow">What a pretty name.</font>

224
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,010
<font color="yellow">That looks good on you.</font>

225
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,810
<font color="yellow">You keep it.</font>

226
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,520
<font color="yellow">Hong Nan.</font>

227
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,210
<font color="yellow">Let's not meet again.</font>

228
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,210
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

229
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,910
<font color="yellow">want to forget the name...</font>

230
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,710
<font color="yellow">Han Gi Tak.</font>

231
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,910
<font color="yellow">As if...</font>

232
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,810
<font color="yellow">he were never in my life to begin with.</font>

233
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,010
<font color="yellow">I'll pay back all the debt I owe Gi Tak...</font>

234
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,280
<font color="yellow">on my own later.</font>

235
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,110
<font color="yellow">You may resent me,</font>

236
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,610
<font color="yellow">but for now,</font>

237
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,480
<font color="yellow">I want to live a quiet life.</font>

238
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,580
<font color="yellow">What did that jerk Suk Chul say to you?</font>

239
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,350
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

240
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,610
<font color="yellow">Get out of my face!</font>

241
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,810
<font color="yellow">It's too late...</font>

242
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,910
<font color="yellow">to repay that debt.</font>

243
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,210
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have...</font>

244
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,110
<font color="yellow">come back.</font>

245
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,310
<font color="yellow">Did you see?</font>

246
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,210
<font color="yellow">That punk shook his body and completely ignored me.</font>

247
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,510
<font color="yellow">He did this as his greeting.</font>

248
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,110
<font color="yellow">Did you see that woman mock me?</font>

249
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,010
<font color="yellow">And who was that kid?</font>

250
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,310
<font color="yellow">They teamed up to insult me, Cha Jae Gook,</font>

251
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,210
<font color="yellow">and in my own department store, too!</font>

252
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,310
<font color="yellow">You too, punks.</font>

253
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,510
<font color="yellow">You should respond when someone talks to you!</font>

254
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,010
<font color="yellow">Shoot!</font>

255
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,110
<font color="yellow">Don't be nervous just because he's the chairman.</font>

256
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,510
<font color="yellow">Right now, he's my father.</font>

257
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,010
<font color="yellow">Mr Chairman! It's an honour to meet you!</font>

258
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,310
<font color="yellow">Mr President. I was out of it earlier.</font>

259
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

260
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,310
<font color="yellow">"Increase Sunjin Department Store's sales by 130 percent in 2 months!"</font>

261
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,010
<font color="yellow">"You'll be busy starting tomorrow, so get some rest!"</font>

262
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,510
<font color="yellow">That is what he says.</font>

263
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,820
<font color="yellow">Whatever it is,</font>

264
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,510
<font color="yellow">don't do it.</font>

265
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,210
<font color="yellow">- Sorry?
- You can't have it anyway.</font>

266
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,690
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

267
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,990
<font color="yellow">Drop the act.</font>

268
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,810
<font color="yellow">What? Just because he called you into the department store,</font>

269
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,210
<font color="yellow">do you think Father will accept you?</font>

270
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,700
<font color="yellow">Absolutely not. Not a chance.</font>

271
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,110
<font color="yellow">So don't even bother.</font>

272
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,410
<font color="yellow">I see. Is that so?</font>

273
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,710
<font color="yellow">If you return to the States now,</font>

274
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,480
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you go back with a lot.</font>

275
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,900
<font color="yellow">The department store is closing down anyway.</font>

276
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,110
<font color="yellow">The losses are multiplying as we speak.</font>

277
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,790
<font color="yellow">The store is shutting down?</font>

278
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,110
<font color="yellow">He was just yelling at me to increase sales.</font>

279
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,010
<font color="yellow">I died for nothing.</font>

280
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,690
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you understand what I mean.</font>

281
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,710
<font color="yellow">You're smart, aren't you?</font>

282
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

283
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,410
<font color="yellow">You're smart, so you understand.</font>

284
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,510
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best, and if I fail,</font>

285
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:19,410
<font color="yellow">we can talk again then. Goodnight.</font>

286
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,110
<font color="yellow">It's about to get interesting.</font>

287
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,010
<font color="yellow">She wants to forget.</font>

288
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,510
<font color="yellow">She wants to erase me,</font>

289
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,510
<font color="yellow">is that it?</font>

290
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,810
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

291
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:14,580
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

292
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,010
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

293
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,310
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

294
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,480
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

295
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

296
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,800
<font color="yellow">What am I doing here?</font>

297
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,710
<font color="yellow">I have nowhere to go...</font>

298
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,310
<font color="yellow">and there is nobody waiting for me.</font>

299
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,410
<font color="yellow">Why did I even come back?</font>

300
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,480
<font color="yellow">I'm so hungry.</font>

301
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,010
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

302
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,310
<font color="yellow">If you need help or have any question,</font>

303
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,910
<font color="yellow">press the star button.</font>

304
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,810
<font color="yellow">It's a direct line to reach me.</font>

305
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,310
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

306
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,510
<font color="yellow">Would you like to return?</font>

307
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,450
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I didn't press it. I really didn't!</font>

308
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,250
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute. Were you watching me all this time?</font>

309
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,710
<font color="yellow">- Are you a pervert?
- It's called monitoring.</font>

310
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,010
<font color="yellow">You are not a prosecutor.</font>

311
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,110
<font color="yellow">What you are doing is illegal.</font>

312
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,310
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

313
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,010
<font color="yellow">Why are you insulting me? I'm just trying to do my job.</font>

314
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,280
<font color="yellow">Don't. Stop working so hard!</font>

315
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,910
<font color="yellow">- It's going down
- It's going down</font>

316

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,010
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

347
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,910
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it?</font>

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,610
<font color="yellow">Shoot. Why is it not working?</font>

349
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,550
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,310
<font color="yellow">Just stay low, you stupid girl.</font>

355
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,910
<font color="yellow">Girl? Did you call me a girl?</font>

356
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,300
<font color="yellow">I bit him like a girl.</font>

357
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,510
<font color="yellow">So unmanly.</font>

358
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,810
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

359
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,380
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

360
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,910
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

361
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,250
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what you are doing?</font>

362
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,080
<font color="yellow">Why would you crawl in there?</font>

363
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,210
<font color="yellow">Did you follow me?</font>

364
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,480
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

365
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,810
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

368
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,060
<font color="yellow">I met her,</font>

369
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,710
<font color="yellow">loved her...</font>

370
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,710
<font color="yellow">When did I turn the light on?</font>

371
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,380
<font color="yellow">I guess you were worried, then.</font>

372
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,700
<font color="yellow">I am not interested in who you are.</font>

373
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,810
<font color="yellow">If you were looking to dig up something,</font>

374
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,310
<font color="yellow">you better go away before you get hurt.</font>

375
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,710
<font color="yellow">You are trying to scare me away,</font>

376
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,550
<font color="yellow">but I know exactly what you are thinking.</font>

377
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,610
<font color="yellow">You are so cute.</font>

378
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,710
<font color="yellow">How can I leave you behind?</font>

379
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,110
<font color="yellow">What a man.</font>

380
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,810
<font color="yellow">Didn't they teach you to respect others in the States?</font>

381
00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:00,950
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Should I call you by your name?</font>

382
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,590
<font color="yellow">You punk.</font>

383
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,780
<font color="yellow">I... I warned you.</font>

384
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,280
<font color="yellow">Get going.</font>

385
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,580
<font color="yellow">Don't treat me like a woman.</font>

386
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,710
<font color="yellow">Treat me like a boss.</font>

387
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,210
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep appearing in front of Song Yi Yeon?</font>

388
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,110
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to ask.</font>

389

<font color="yellow">- I saw a ghost!
- That dude.</font>

390
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,050
<font color="yellow">Why did he appear in front of Song Yi Yeon all of a sudden?</font>

391
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,410
<font color="yellow">This is dangerous.</font>

392

<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

393
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,090

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,710
<font color="yellow">Why am I shaking?</font>

475
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,480
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

476
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,120
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

477
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,610
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

478
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,510
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

479
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,480
<font color="yellow">Here's your coffee. Did you have a good break?</font>

480
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,280
<font color="yellow">Yes, thank you.</font>

481
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,980
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

482
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,180
<font color="yellow">you're not upset about serving coffee, are you?</font>

483
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,900
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

484
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:00,200
<font color="yellow">I am very honoured to serve you.</font>

485
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,710
<font color="yellow">Please help me until I grasp my tasks here.</font>

486
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,710
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. I'll do my best.</font>

487
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,150
<font color="yellow">Stand aside.</font>

488
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,980
<font color="yellow">Don't block the view.</font>

489
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,420
<font color="yellow">They can't see me.</font>

490
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,920
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

491
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,280
<font color="yellow">you ordered the full glass walls for...</font>

492
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,050
<font color="yellow">It's a work benefit.</font>

493
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,780
<font color="yellow">- Hi.
- Gosh.</font>

494
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,610
<font color="yellow">It's to cheer up the employees.</font>

495
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,450
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

496
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,410
<font color="yellow">I'm cheered up as well.</font>

497
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,310
<font color="yellow">Very much so.</font>

498
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,980
<font color="yellow">When you receive new menswear products,</font>

499
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,610
<font color="yellow">send them to my office first.</font>

500
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,810
<font color="yellow">Pardon? What for?</font>

501
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:39,920
<font color="yellow">I'll put them on and walk around. I'll be like a model roaming around.</font>

502
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,710
<font color="yellow">The sales will shoot up, won't it?</font>

503
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,010
<font color="yellow">I see, Sir.</font>

504
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,350
<font color="yellow">It's more convincing because you said it yourself.</font>

505
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,010
<font color="yellow">One's face completes one's look.</font>

506
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,110
<font color="yellow">Face completes fashion.</font>

507
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,610
<font color="yellow">You are complete.</font>

508
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,610
<font color="yellow">You work in fashion. When will you complete your look?</font>

509
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,680
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

510
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,950
<font color="yellow">Your eyelids are starting to sag. How about getting them lifted?</font>

511
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,690
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

512
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,580
<font color="yellow">If you leave them like that,</font>

513
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,410
<font color="yellow">they'll sag like this. You might not be able to see.</font>

514
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,980
<font color="yellow">No, Sir. I can see very well.</font>

515
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,930
<font color="yellow">All right. Let me know when you can't see.</font>

516
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,480
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

517
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

518
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,680
<font color="yellow">Oh goodness.</font>

519
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,110
<font color="yellow">What is it, Sir?</font>

520
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,210
<font color="yellow">I want iced coffee all of a sudden.</font>

521
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,810
<font color="yellow">On a cold day like this?</font>

522
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,510
<font color="yellow">Shall I bring a new one?</font>

523
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,080
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Sure. I'll bring a new one.</font>

524
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,580
<font color="yellow">I'll bring iced coffee.</font>

525
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:57,120
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

526
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,610
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

527
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,290
<font color="yellow">Did he bring a woman?</font>

528
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,810
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir. And...</font>

529
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,710
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

530
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,190
<font color="yellow">You whisper like a sad undertaker asking for payment.</font>

531
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,620
<font color="yellow">Stop that.</font>

532
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,280
<font color="yellow">Whisper of an undertaker?</font>

533
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,080
<font color="yellow">Just say it out loud.</font>

534
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,420
<font color="yellow">- Nobody is listening.
- Right, Sir.</font>

535
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,310
<font color="yellow">I think she was the reason why he postponed coming to work.</font>

536
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,410
<font color="yellow">He invited her to his house.</font>

537
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:44,010
<font color="yellow">He spent many nights drinking with her in expensive bars.</font>

538
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:46,380
<font color="yellow">He finally brought her to the department store...</font>

539
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,850
<font color="yellow">and...</font>

540
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:50,510
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

541
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,110
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

542
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,980
<font color="yellow">they are shopping.</font>

543
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,710
<font color="yellow">Bang!</font>

544
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,310
<font color="yellow">These are just my taste.</font>

545
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,980
<font color="yellow">Those are mine!</font>

546
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,780
<font color="yellow">Buy me! Buy me!</font>

547
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:27,010
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

548
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:29,410
<font color="yellow">Please buy me.</font>

549
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,410
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Oh my.</font>

550
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,810
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mr Lee.</font>

551
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,700
<font color="yellow">My friend wants to buy some clothes.</font>

552
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,180
<font color="yellow">Then I will help...</font>

553
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,710
<font color="yellow">Will you help, Ms Shin Da Hye?</font>

554
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,280
<font color="yellow">Me, Sir?</font>

555
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,610
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

556
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:55,280
<font color="yellow">She...</font>

557
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:57,650
<font color="yellow">is really my friend.</font>

558
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,910
<font color="yellow">She has horrible taste.</font>

559
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,980
<font color="yellow">Please recommend her some clothes.</font>

560
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,710
<font color="yellow">Please help me.</font>

561
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,610
<font color="yellow">Your wife is so pretty.</font>

562
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,810
<font color="yellow">No wonder you insisted on coming back.</font>

563
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:22,610
<font color="yellow">She's totally cute.</font>

564
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,910
<font color="yellow">Would you like to try it on?</font>

565
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,080
<font color="yellow">- You look beautiful.
- You look beautiful.</font>

566
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,610
<font color="yellow">Do I have to wear these stockings?</font>

567
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,710
<font color="yellow">They're giving me a wedgie.</font>

568
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:00,180
<font color="yellow">It's nice and elegant. We'll take this.</font>

569
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,880
<font color="yellow">And that and that.</font>

570
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,610
<font color="yellow">Ring up the bag and shoes, too.</font>

571
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,080
<font color="yellow">All of them?</font>

572
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,280
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

573
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,580
<font color="yellow">I'll charge it.</font>

574
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,610
<font color="yellow">The black card that only the top one percent uses.</font>

575
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,010
<font color="yellow">Single payment please.</font>

576
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,910
<font color="yellow">- How much is it?
- That will be 9,620 dollars.</font>

577
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,510
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Don't do it.</font>

578
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,450
<font color="yellow">When else would I do this?</font>

579
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,610
<font color="yellow">- Single payment, please.
- Yes, Sir.</font>

580
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,910
<font color="yellow">It's okay. I'm the store manager. It's okay. I'm the store manager.</font>

581
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,060
<font color="yellow">That would be months of my salary.</font>

582
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,580
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

583
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,580
<font color="yellow">He has so much money already.</font>

584
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,510
<font color="yellow">I see why women shop when they're depressed.</font>

585
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:03,010
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

586
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:05,310
<font color="yellow">What is that walk?</font>

587
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,850
<font color="yellow">Women are all about attitude. Stand up straight. Chest...</font>

588
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,010
<font color="yellow">Chest out.</font>

589
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,250
<font color="yellow">Stick out your butt like this.</font>

590
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,050
<font color="yellow">This is the most beautiful pose.</font>

591
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,580
<font color="yellow">Like this?</font>

592
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,910
<font color="yellow">Can't you do that right?</font>

593
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,250
<font color="yellow">Is it hard?</font>

594
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,810
<font color="yellow">- Put your hand on your waist and...
- Okay.</font>

595
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,710
<font color="yellow">Press down and...</font>

596
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,380
<font color="yellow">What a waste of expensive clothes.</font>

597
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,050
<font color="yellow">But you know,</font>

598
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,080
<font color="yellow">your wife seemed very familiar.</font>

599
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,580
<font color="yellow">Where have I seen her before?</font>

600
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,180
<font color="yellow">Where would you have seen her?</font>

601
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sure I've seen her before.</font>

602
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,480
<font color="yellow">Maybe she looks like Madam Bong from the club.</font>

603
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,280
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

604
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,080
<font color="yellow">I've already died, punk.</font>

605
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,810
<font color="yellow">By it for me.</font>

606
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,100
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey!</font>

607
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,180
<font color="yellow">Do you have an appointment?</font>

608
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,010
<font color="yellow">Someone else stood there and asked me the same question before.</font>

609
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she was fired the next day.</font>

610
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:40,480
<font color="yellow">Of course, that was long ago.</font>

611
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,760
<font color="yellow">He's in a meeting right now.</font>

612
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,480
<font color="yellow">They say that every time I call.</font>

613
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,880
<font color="yellow">It's good to be busy.</font>

614
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,280
<font color="yellow">As long as he doesn't forget who made this a major movie company.</font>

615
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,180
<font color="yellow">I can't wait long.</font>

616
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,310
<font color="yellow">You can't go in!</font>

617
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,250
<font color="yellow">You came out.</font>

618
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,610
<font color="yellow">Miss Song.</font>

619
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,310
<font color="yellow">What brings you all the way here?</font>

620
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,190
<font color="yellow">You seemed busy, so I came myself.</font>

621
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,380
<font color="yellow">Did you talk to the director?</font>

622
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,090
<font color="yellow">Oh, that.</font>

623
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,910
<font color="yellow">I told him that you would be perfect for the role,</font>

624
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,950
<font color="yellow">but he had a different image in mind.</font>

625
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,710
<font color="yellow">Most actresses won't be able to pull off that role.</font>

626
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,410
<font color="yellow">My sentiments exactly.</font>

627
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,180
<font color="yellow">But you know how stubborn Director Bong is.</font>

628
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,910
<font color="yellow">He's not a rookie, so I can't be too pushy.</font>

629
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,080
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

630
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,010
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you at the shoot.
- Okay.</font>

631
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,580
<font color="yellow">Miss Song.</font>

632
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,310
<font color="yellow">I'll play a mum.</font>

633
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,580
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Grandmother. That's fine.</font>

634
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,860
<font color="yellow">Small roles are fine. Just give me something.</font>

635
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,480
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon.</font>

636
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,080
<font color="yellow">For old times' sake.</font>

637
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,580
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

638
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,010
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

639
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,080
<font color="yellow">but I have no choice. That was the investor's condition.</font>

640
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,070
<font color="yellow">Sunjin Group has been pressuring everyone,</font>

641
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,180
<font color="yellow">so you'll only be able to do indie films for a while.</font>

642
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,410
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

643
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,810
<font color="yellow">You must be so upset.</font>

644
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,080
<font color="yellow">That scum!</font>

645
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,080
<font color="yellow">Shoot.</font>

646
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,610
<font color="yellow">Director Bong is calling.</font>

647
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,710
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

648
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,910
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir?</font>

649
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,010
<font color="yellow">What? Today?</font>

650
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,910
<font color="yellow">Do I have time? Of course...</font>

651
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,580
<font color="yellow">I'll have to check.</font>

652
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,410
<font color="yellow">How does my day look? I have a little time? Okay.</font>

653
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,180
<font color="yellow">I have a little time.</font>

654
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,980
<font color="yellow">I don't usually go to that part of town, but I'll go just for you.</font>

655
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,910
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll see you later.</font>

656
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,510
<font color="yellow">He asks for hot coffee then iced coffee...</font>

657
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,710
<font color="yellow">then honey water.</font>

658
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:33,290
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

659
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,610
<font color="yellow">he has a strange habit, too.</font>

660
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,210
<font color="yellow">Let's work hard together.</font>

661
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,310
<font color="yellow">Do you need help?</font>

662
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,380
<font color="yellow">I guess I don't have to worry.</font>

663
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:08,280
<font color="yellow">Punks like that are easy.</font>

664
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,580
<font color="yellow">He's not as great as the rumours say he is.</font>

665
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,080
<font color="yellow">I drank a lot last night.</font>

666
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,810
<font color="yellow">You should all cut back too.</font>

667
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,610
<font color="yellow">You'll get in trouble in your afterlife.</font>

668
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,610
<font color="yellow">Mr Jung, what are you doing here?</font>

669
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,790
<font color="yellow">He was recently promoted to manager.</font>

670
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,180
<font color="yellow">You were? Manager?</font>

671
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,180
<font color="yellow">Wow. Then you're the same as Mr Ma.</font>

672
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,250
<font color="yellow">How impressive.</font>

673
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,710
<font color="yellow">Ji... I mean, Mr Jung.</font>

674
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,680
<font color="yellow">You saw Kim Young Soo on the way to work on the day he died, right?</font>

675
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,980
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

676
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,690
<font color="yellow">His daughter says...</font>

677
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,880
<font color="yellow">he had a date with his wife that day.</font>

678
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,010
<font color="yellow">And he asked you to cover for him at work, right?</font>

679
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,610
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

680
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,710
<font color="yellow">You're saying someone who asked you to cover for him and had a date...</font>

681
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,480
<font color="yellow">committed suicide, is that it?</font>

682
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,510
<font color="yellow">That is...</font>

683
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,210
<font color="yellow">Why did you conclude it was suicide when there was no note?</font>

684
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,780
<font color="yellow">Did you see him on camera?</font>

685
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:31,780
<font color="yellow">We have a video of him getting into the elevator alone.</font>

686
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,010
<font color="yellow">He took off his shoes and there was no sign of foul play.</font>

687
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:36,510
<font color="yellow">Because of these and other reasons, the police concluded it was suicide.</font>

688
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,870
<font color="yellow">I see. Circumstantial evidence.</font>

689
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,680
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

690
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:43,710
<font color="yellow">but I don't understand why you keep asking about him.</font>

691
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,250
<font color="yellow">Why am I here?</font>

692
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,080
<font color="yellow">Because the chairman told you to increase sales.</font>

693
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,210
<font color="yellow">Sale? Yes!</font>

694
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:52,410
<font color="yellow">I need to increase sales.</font>

695
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:53,910
<font color="yellow">But would you want to...</font>

696
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,210
<font color="yellow">shop at a despicable store like this where an employee took bribes...</font>

697
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:57,810
<font color="yellow">and killed himself?</font>

698
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,180
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

699
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,250
<font color="yellow">I want to clear this despicable store's name.</font>

700
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,410
<font color="yellow">- Pardon?
- Pardon?</font>

701
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:07,710
<font color="yellow">I plan to expose why Mr Kim had to die here, to which...</font>

702
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:09,180
<font color="yellow">he devoted himself for 15 years.</font>

703
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,710
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the reason is right here.</font>

704
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,410
<font color="yellow">Are you saying...</font>

705
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,410
<font color="yellow">whether or not it was suicide,</font>

706
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,110
<font color="yellow">the cause is within the company?</font>

707
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,480
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

708
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:22,810
<font color="yellow">If something is rotten,</font>

709
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:25,080
<font color="yellow">we must cut that out, must we not?</font>

710
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,550
<font color="yellow">For the sake of our sales.</font>

711
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,110
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Mr President?</font>

712
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:37,010
<font color="yellow">- What was his problem?
- Exactly. I don't understand.</font>

713
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:42,010
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee is very zealous.</font>

714
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,810
<font color="yellow">Let's hear what you have to say.</font>

715
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,910
<font color="yellow">These are people who saw Mr Kim...</font>

716
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:51,110
<font color="yellow">on the day that he died.</font>

717
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,280
<font color="yellow">That night,</font>

718
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,650
<font color="yellow">he was very desperate and passionate.</font>

719
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,810
<font color="yellow">He didn't look well.</font>

720
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,760
<font color="yellow">He said it was his anniversary...</font>

721
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,010
<font color="yellow">and that he hurt his family, and begged and begged...</font>

722
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:11,480
<font color="yellow">for another chance.</font>

723
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,610
<font color="yellow">To be honest,</font>

724
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:18,010
<font color="yellow">he's the one that won the Lucia deal.</font>

725
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:20,300
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

726
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,110
<font color="yellow">he committed suicide that very night?</font>

727
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,210
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

728
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:34,250
<font color="yellow">I was shocked when I saw the news.</font>

729
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,350
<font color="yellow">I felt like I did something wrong.</font>

730
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,710
<font color="yellow">I didn't smell any alcohol on him.</font>

731
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,510
<font color="yellow">He rushed out of the car...</font>

732
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,910
<font color="yellow">and suddenly threw up.</font>

733
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:50,580
<font color="yellow">Did you see him jump?</font>

734
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,510
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

735
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,680
<font color="yellow">I heard a thump and looked down and...</font>

736
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,080
<font color="yellow">he was already...</font>

737
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:58,700
<font color="yellow">Wait, is that a camera?</font>

738
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,080
<font color="yellow">Why you...</font>

739
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,810
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say. Just go.</font>

740
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:05,150
<font color="yellow">I heard you quit the job the day after Mr Kim died.</font>

741
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,410
<font color="yellow">Will you explain?</font>

742
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,910
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to say!</font>

743
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,010
<font color="yellow">Leave me alone!</font>

744
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:17,610
<font color="yellow">We couldn't get anything else from him after this.</font>

745
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,680
<font color="yellow">What was he so afraid of?</font>

746
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,210
<font color="yellow">But you know...</font>

747
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:32,450
<font color="yellow">we need to focus on what he did say.</font>

748
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:47,610
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

749
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,610
<font color="yellow">I heard a thump and looked down and...</font>

750
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,980
<font color="yellow">he was already...</font>

751
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,110
<font color="yellow">The camera is awesome.</font>

752
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,480
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

753
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,910
<font color="yellow">It smells all sorts of dirty.</font>

754
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,680
<font color="yellow">He didn't see it.</font>

755
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,710
<font color="yellow">He was on the roof for 1 to 2 minutes.</font>

756
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,810
<font color="yellow">Unless he was hanging on somewhere where he couldn't see and fell,</font>

757
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:09,510
<font color="yellow">it was enough time to witness someone trying to commit suicide.</font>

758
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,700
<font color="yellow">Let's assume something.</font>

759
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:15,390
<font color="yellow">Everyone said he looked ill that night.</font>

760
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:19,110
<font color="yellow">What if he didn't jump voluntarily?</font>

761
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,510
<font color="yellow">So what is that reason?</font>

762
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,910
<font color="yellow">He isn't a window-washer.</font>

763
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,610
<font color="yellow">Why did he go up there unless he meant to die?</font>

764
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:37,450
<font color="yellow">It's not like we can ask a dead man.</font>

765
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,310
<font color="yellow">Mr Lee.</font>

766
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,010
<font color="yellow">So, are you saying it was or it was not suicide?</font>

767
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:56,350
<font color="yellow">That's what I'd like to ask all of you.</font>

768
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,810
<font color="yellow">There is a man.</font>

769
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,410
<font color="yellow">He works himself to death during sales season...</font>

770
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,710
<font color="yellow">to meet the target of 130 percent increase.</font>

771
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:09,810
<font color="yellow">There are times when he sleeps 2 hours and eats twice in 2 days.</font>

772
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,910
<font color="yellow">He eats kimbap, hamburgers and the like...</font>

773
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,910
<font color="yellow">and downs it with soda.</font>

774
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,810
<font color="yellow">He has no time to work out and goes to the gym twice in six months.</font>

775
00:59:17,810 --> 00:59:21,210
<font color="yellow">He takes diet pill because his boss tells him to lose weight.</font>

776
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:23,470
<font color="yellow">And he drinks every day with clients.</font>

777
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:27,010
<font color="yellow">If you add up all the alcohol he has drunk, it is 1/30,000 of...</font>

778
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,510
<font color="yellow">the Pacific. Is this or is this not suicide?</font>

779
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,710
<font color="yellow">Cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction, high blood pressure,</font>

00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:49,150
<font color="yellow">His body probably sends him signals with constant pain,</font>

785
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,810
<font color="yellow">but he ignores them and pushes onward.</font>

786
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:53,210
<font color="yellow">Is this or is this not suicide?</font>

787
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:56,080
<font color="yellow">A suicide without a doubt.</font>

788
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:04,820
<font color="yellow">You work an average of 40 hours a week, correct?</font>

789
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,210
<font color="yellow">With Mr Kim,</font>

790
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,410
<font color="yellow">he worked on average 72 hours a week...</font>

791
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,610
<font color="yellow">although he was paid for only 45.</font>

792
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:15,010
<font color="yellow">He devoted more than half of his life to this place.</font>

793
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,070
<font color="yellow">That's how most of the employees at the department store work.</font>

794
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,110
<font color="yellow">Everyone who works with them can attest to that.</font>

795
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:24,710
<font color="yellow">You pressure someone with unrealistic sales targets...</font>

796
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:28,200
<font color="yellow">and yet, how can you say his death was not the company's fault?</font>

797
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,480
<font color="yellow">If the company is even one percent responsible,</font>

798
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,710
<font color="yellow">we must admit it and compensate him accordingly...</font>

799
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,810
<font color="yellow">at least for the family...</font>

800
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,050
<font color="yellow">who lost their only husband,</font>

801
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:42,080
<font color="yellow">father and son.</font>

802
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,510
<font color="yellow">That was very moving.</font>

803
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:54,210
<font color="yellow">You have a point.</font>

804
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,610
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

805
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,210
<font color="yellow">you said the company is responsible for Mr Kim's death.</font>

806
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,680
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

807
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,210
<font color="yellow">is that woman Shin Da Hye working at...</font>

808
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,910
<font color="yellow">the company that killed her husband?</font>

809
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:14,910
<font color="yellow">If she had any suspicion about her husband's death,</font>

810
01:01:14,910 --> 01:01:18,610
<font color="yellow">how could she work at this company?</font>

811
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,580
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree, Ms Shin?</font>

812
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:46,550
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

813
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:50,350
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey!</font>

814
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,450
<font color="yellow">Is it hypothermia?</font>

815
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,510
<font color="yellow">No! No! You can't die.</font>

816
01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:58,610
<font color="yellow">No! You can't leave me here and die!</font>

817
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,010
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

818
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:07,810
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

819
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,010
<font color="yellow">(Come Back Alive)</font>

820
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,460
<font color="yellow">It is too painful for me to look at you.</font>

821
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:33,210
<font color="yellow">Did you think you could keep hiding it?</font>

822
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:36,310
<font color="yellow">Why did he have to die?</font>

823
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,710
<font color="yellow">I'll give you that answer.</font>

824
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,350
<font color="yellow">Please wait.</font>
