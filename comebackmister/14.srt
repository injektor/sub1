<font color="yellow">the store manager of Sunjin Department Store?</font>

125

<font color="yellow">Is that him? Is that Na Suk Chul?</font>

<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul.</font>

130
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,550
<font color="yellow">My old friend...</font>

131
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,420
<font color="yellow">or more like...</font>

132
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,880
<font color="yellow">someone who thinks of me as his enemy.</font>

133
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,480
<font color="yellow">Big Boss was more fond of me...</font>

134
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,750
<font color="yellow">than Na Suk Chul even after I quit,</font>

135
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,290
<font color="yellow">and that became his venom.</font>

136
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,250
<font color="yellow">Big Boss couldn't trust him,</font>

137
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,650
<font color="yellow">so he left the funds to me.</font>

138
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,290
<font color="yellow">He did this to you so he can find the money?</font>

139
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,920
<font color="yellow">Where is that money?</font>

140
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,150
<font color="yellow">Somewhere safe.</font>

141
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,220
<font color="yellow">It's a secret account under Gi Tak's name at a Swiss bank.</font>

142
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,320
<font color="yellow">You need to have the secret key to withdraw the money.</font>

143
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,680
<font color="yellow">Gi Tak died...</font>

144
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,880
<font color="yellow">so only the remaining family members can take over the account.</font>

145
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,020
<font color="yellow">By family members,</font>

146
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,520
<font color="yellow">do you mean Da Hye?</font>

147
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,580
<font color="yellow">Then, she needs to know that she had a brother.</font>

148
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,880
<font color="yellow">If in any case...</font>

149
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,120
<font color="yellow">Na Suk Chul finds out that Da Hye is my real sister...</font>

150
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,250
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

151
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,820
<font color="yellow">I think it's best if I don't see her for a while.</font>

152
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

153
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,950
<font color="yellow">let Da Hye get hurt.</font>

154
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
<font color="yellow">Boss.</font>

155
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,790
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this on behalf of Gi Tak.</font>

156
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,180
<font color="yellow">Don't seek...</font>

157
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,720
<font color="yellow">revenge on anyone.</font>

158
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,650
<font color="yellow">I thought you were going to die.</font>

159
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
<font color="yellow">Why would I die?</font>

160

471
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,520
<font color="yellow">It's not because of you.</font>

472
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,350
<font color="yellow">It's for Da Hye.</font>

473
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,420
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

474
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,180
<font color="yellow">She has nowhere...</font>

475
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,580
<font color="yellow">but the department store to remind her of her husband.</font>

476
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,980
<font color="yellow">I don't want this pub to be a source of pain as well.</font>

477
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,950
<font color="yellow">It's the only place where the three of us met while alive.</font>

478
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,850
<font color="yellow">I want to replace the bad memories with good ones.</font>

479
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,350
<font color="yellow">You fool.</font>

480
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,950
<font color="yellow">Who else would've helped me, but you?</font>

481
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,050
<font color="yellow">Right? Boss.</font>

482
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,520
<font color="yellow">Welcome!</font>

484
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,420
<font color="yellow">Welcome, our dear customer.</font>

485
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,320
<font color="yellow">Sit here.</font>

486
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,450
<font color="yellow">Can I make an order?</font>

487
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,150
<font color="yellow">It finally feels like...</font>

488
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,320
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

489
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,680
<font color="yellow">- Welcome to Han Gi Tak's Knulp!
- Welcome to Han Gi Tak's Knulp!</font>

490
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,850
<font color="yellow">You guys...</font>

491
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:00,220
<font color="yellow">What? Were you moved to tears? Okay, fine.</font>

492
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,450
<font color="yellow">Fine, I get it.</font>

493
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,050
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- Fine.</font>

494
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,520
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Boss? Blow the candle.</font>

495
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,480
<font color="yellow">I'm the owner?</font>

496
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,680
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's blow it out!</font>

497
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,180
<font color="yellow">Hold on, wait!</font>

498
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,480
<font color="yellow">It's such a historic day. I need to take my camera out.</font>

499
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,120
<font color="yellow">Okay. Wait, hold on.</font>

500
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,950
<font color="yellow">Why is this so blurry?</font>

501
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,120
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

502
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, that looks good.</font>

503
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,680
<font color="yellow">You look so ugly!</font>

504
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,180
<font color="yellow">- Hurrah!
- Cheers!</font>

505
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,920
<font color="yellow">He's my type.</font>

506
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,950
<font color="yellow">How cute. He's so cute. Look at him.</font>

507
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,890
<font color="yellow">They look happy.</font>

508
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,820
<font color="yellow">You rascals.</font>

509
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,750
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can reopen the pub at this rate?</font>

510
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,120
<font color="yellow">It's been merely a few months and you've lost your grip.</font>

511
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,120
<font color="yellow">Get your mind back in the game.</font>

512
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,420
<font color="yellow">Commence!</font>

513
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,120
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Ma'am!
- Yes, Ma'am!</font>

514
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,980
<font color="yellow">Don't be confused. Stay calm.</font>

515
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,520
<font color="yellow">She has tendency to intimidate others.</font>

516
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,820
<font color="yellow">No wonder you are related to Gi Tak.</font>

517
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,580
<font color="yellow">You focus on your own job. Just do your job.</font>

518
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,350
<font color="yellow">You're the most troublesome out of all of you.</font>

519
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,950
<font color="yellow">Can you tell sugar, salt and artificial seasoning apart?</font>

520
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
<font color="yellow">I cannot.</font>

521
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,350
<font color="yellow">Just do your job and stop trying to discipline the guys.</font>

522
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,720
<font color="yellow">Are you watching?</font>

523
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:36,050
<font color="yellow">It feels like you are back.</font>

524
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,120
<font color="yellow">The consignee is Lee Hae Joon,</font>

525
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,850
<font color="yellow">the store manager of Sunjin Department Store.</font>

526
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,220
<font color="yellow">Sunjin Department Store?</font>

527
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,520
<font color="yellow">He's the one who brought Han Gi Tak's guys...</font>

528
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,420
<font color="yellow">to rescue the girl.</font>

529
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,020
<font color="yellow">So Lee Hae Joon and Han Gi Tak know each other.</font>

530
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,580
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

531
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,150
<font color="yellow">You're back late.</font>

532
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,180
<font color="yellow">Did you wait for me?</font>

533
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

534
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,780
<font color="yellow">People usually stay up when their family hasn't returned home.</font>

535
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,220
<font color="yellow">Family?</font>

536
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,320
<font color="yellow">You should rest.</font>

537
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,050
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have dinner...</font>

538
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,520
<font color="yellow">with me tomorrow evening?</font>

539
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,050
<font color="yellow">Let's eat together before I leave for good.</font>

540
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,020
<font color="yellow">I hope you can make it.</font>

541
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,980
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

542
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,280
<font color="yellow">Han Na,</font>

543
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,420
<font color="yellow">you can go to school on your own now, right?</font>

544
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,480
<font color="yellow">Try to go with your friends and use the main roads.</font>

545
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:11,180
<font color="yellow">When a stranger talks to you, ask for help from adults nearby.</font>

546
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,480
<font color="yellow">And when you're going out, make sure you tell...</font>

547
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,220
<font color="yellow">your mum and grandpa where you're going. Got it?</font>

548
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,020
<font color="yellow">Fine, I get it.</font>

549
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,750
<font color="yellow">Stop nagging me.</font>

550
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,550
<font color="yellow">You're just like my daddy.</font>

551
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,950
<font color="yellow">Fine, Kid.</font>

552
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,120
<font color="yellow">You can go by yourself, right?</font>

553
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,350
<font color="yellow">Why? Why do I have to go by myself?</font>

554
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,520
<font color="yellow">I have to go to work.</font>

555
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,450
<font color="yellow">- Okay, then.
- Hold on.</font>

556
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,580
<font color="yellow">I walked you all the way here, so you have to pay for it.</font>

557
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,850
<font color="yellow">You look like an octopus.</font>

<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

560
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,450
<font color="yellow">Sir, do it like me!</font>

561
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,580
<font color="yellow">Like this! It's good for preventing dementia.</font>

562
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,420
<font color="yellow">- Like this?
- Good job.</font>

563
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,780
<font color="yellow">- You're doing well.
- Like this!</font>

564
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,520
<font color="yellow">Walking and exercising are good for preventing dementia.</font>

565
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,820
<font color="yellow">Even when I'm gone, you should come out...</font>

566
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,920
<font color="yellow">and meet your friends. Keep exercising, too.</font>

567
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,120
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry.</font>

568
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,550
<font color="yellow">I'm strong for my age.</font>

569
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,980
<font color="yellow">My brain is functioning perfectly, too.</font>

570
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,280
<font color="yellow">And my spine is also in good shape.</font>

571
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,650
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

572
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,350
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

573
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,550
<font color="yellow">Father, when did you shrink?</font>

574
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,750
<font color="yellow">You used to be so big.</font>

575
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,020
<font color="yellow">I'm still in good condition.</font>

576
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,480
<font color="yellow">Hello, ladies! Hello!</font>

577
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,390
<font color="yellow">He just started working out here. Please treat him well.</font>

578
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,480
<font color="yellow">- Sure.
- Hello.</font>

579
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,620
<font color="yellow">He's so charming.</font>

580
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,780
<font color="yellow">He's smart, too.</font>

581
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,780
<font color="yellow">His hips are nice and his waist is strong, too.</font>

582
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,350
<font color="yellow">Sir, show them.</font>

583
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,820
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

584
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,890
<font color="yellow">I wonder.</font>

585
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:51,280
<font color="yellow">One of you fall into the river and the other gets kidnapped.</font>

586
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,250
<font color="yellow">What a mess.</font>

587
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,620
<font color="yellow">Why are you staying behind here for?</font>

588
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,850
<font color="yellow">Anyone could drop by here.</font>

589
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,680
<font color="yellow">And here's that random person dropping by here.</font>

590
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,780
<font color="yellow">What is it now? What is it?</font>

591
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:03,890
<font color="yellow">Young Chan is looking for you!</font>

592
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,220
<font color="yellow">I'll come and get him!</font>

593
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,620
<font color="yellow">He wants to eat with you.</font>

594
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,320
<font color="yellow">The three of us.</font>

595
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,550
<font color="yellow">It's not like I want to but I don't have a choice. That's what he wants.</font>

596
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,050
<font color="yellow">For goodness' sake.</font>

597
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,350
<font color="yellow">Why am I even wasting my precious time...</font>

598
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,250
<font color="yellow">here to tell you this, anyway?</font>

599
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,850
<font color="yellow">It's deserted here.</font>

600
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,480
<font color="yellow">I don't know who he takes after, but he's eating well and growing fast.</font>

601
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,750
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why is he acting like that? He's making me more anxious.</font>

602
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,520
<font color="yellow">Don't get intimidated by him.</font>

603
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,580
<font color="yellow">He can't get his hands on you now.</font>

604
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,850
<font color="yellow">I wasn't intimidated.</font>

605
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,750
<font color="yellow">I won't let him step all over me any more.</font>

606
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,480
<font color="yellow">Yi Yeon.</font>

607
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,390
<font color="yellow">I have a favour to ask of you.</font>

608
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,390
<font color="yellow">Forget about Jae Gook and Gi Tak...</font>

609
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,050
<font color="yellow">and you should enjoy your life.</font>

610
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,220
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

611
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,850
<font color="yellow">I've started the second phase of my life.</font>

612
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,220
<font color="yellow">I hope you meet a good man next time.</font>

613
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,280
<font color="yellow">Not like Gi Tak who loved but was a coward...</font>

614
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,620
<font color="yellow">or Jae Gook who liked you but harassed you.</font>

615
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,320
<font color="yellow">You should meet a man...</font>

616
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,390
<font color="yellow">who'll love you for who you are.</font>

617
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,850
<font color="yellow">No, actually,</font>

618
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,550
<font color="yellow">you don't have to date anyone.</font>

619
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,750
<font color="yellow">Just...</font>

620
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,420
<font color="yellow">meet someone nice.</font>

621
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,820
<font color="yellow">Someone who can...</font>

622
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,580
<font color="yellow">stay by your side as a friend and as family.</font>

623
