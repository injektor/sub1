3
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,060
<font color="yellow">Let us go.</font>

4
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,460
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are you acting like this
over some damn urn?</i></font>

5
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,160
<font color="yellow"><i>You don't even appreciate her
raising you all this time</i></font>

6
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,560
<font color="yellow"><i>and you're lying
and trying to alienate her?</i></font>

7
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,860
<font color="yellow"><i>I never should have raised
someone else's child.</i></font>

8
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,260
<font color="yellow">Everything will be fine
once you're gone.</font>

9
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,120
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm... not your real daughter?</i></font>

10
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,660
<font color="yellow"><i>You're someone that your mother
had with another man!</i></font>

11
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,770
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

12
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,260
<font color="yellow">I'll make the special announcement
from the Chairman now.</font>

13
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,760
<font color="yellow">Ms. Eun Ha Won will be living here at
Sky House with you all, starting today.</font>

14
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

15
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,460
<font color="yellow">She's going to live here?</font>

16
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,960
<font color="yellow">Really? For real?
Why, though?</font>

17
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,760
<font color="yellow">Ridiculous.</font>

18
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,960
<font color="yellow">When you said "everyone" before,
does that include Kang Ji Woon?</font>

19
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,460
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

20
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,260
<font color="yellow">Ridiculous.</font>

21
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,760
<font color="yellow">Why bring back someone
who said he didn't want to live here?</font>

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,970
<font color="yellow">It also doesn't make sense
to force a playboy and his fiancée</font>

23
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,160
<font color="yellow">into the same house.</font>

24
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,320
<font color="yellow">There you two go again.</font>

25
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="yellow">This is something that
the Chairman decided.</font>

26
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,350
<font color="yellow">Wow, this is ridiculous.</font>

27
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,160
<font color="yellow">How are we supposed to live with a girl?
It'll be so uncomfortable!</font>

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,060
<font color="yellow">What is Grandpa thinking?</font>

29
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,560
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm sure he has a plan.</font>

30
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,360
<font color="yellow">- But he might not.
- He doesn't.</font>

31
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,160
<font color="yellow">But, there's just one rule.</font>

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,160
<font color="yellow">Dating is forbidden within Sky House.</font>

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,820
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

34
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,160
<font color="yellow">Isn't she Kang Hyun Min's girlfriend?
So, what do you mean, "no dating"?</font>

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,360
<font color="yellow">It's not like Kang Hyun Min
has only one girlfriend.</font>

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,650
<font color="yellow">Well, duh.</font>

37
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,140
<font color="yellow">Actually, Hyun Min and Ms. Ha Won--</font>

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
<font color="yellow">Yoon Sung!</font>

39
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,740
<font color="yellow">Wait! Come with me.</font>

40
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,540
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

41
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,240
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest with everyone.</font>

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,940
<font color="yellow">Wait, wait!</font>

43
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,040
<font color="yellow">I thought you said
we're forbidden to date her.</font>

44
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,540
<font color="yellow">Think about it carefully.</font>

45
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,040
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be safer if we just let them
believe that she's my fiancée?</font>

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
<font color="yellow">Just look at them.</font>

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,940
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that they'd go crazy
for anything in a dress?</font>

48
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,140
<font color="yellow">Isn't that you?</font>

49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,440
<font color="yellow">You don't know it, do you?
Those punks are no joke.</font>

50
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,440
<font color="yellow">Let's reveal the truth.</font>

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,840
<font color="yellow">Come on, Yoon Sung!
Can you just go along with it?</font>

52
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,340
<font color="yellow">I promise I can stop all of them
from breaking the rule!</font>

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,440
<font color="yellow">If anything should still happen,
I'll give up all my credit cards. Deal?</font>

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,740
<font color="yellow">You'd better uphold
your end of that promise.</font>

55
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,640
<font color="yellow">Of course I will!
Hurry, let's go!</font>

56
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,140
<font color="yellow">Where's Ji Woon?</font>

57
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,040
<font color="yellow">He left. You know how he is.</font>

58
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,840
<font color="yellow">At any rate, as long as
Ms. Ha Won is here</font>

59
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,440
<font color="yellow">dating within Sky House
is strictly forbidden.</font>

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,040
<font color="yellow">Does that mean you have to
break up with her?</font>

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,540
<font color="yellow">I'm an exemption.</font>

62
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,740
<font color="yellow">You're the most dangerous one of all.</font>

63
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,540
<font color="yellow">You in particular... be careful.</font>

64
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,940
<font color="yellow">You heard him, right?
I'm an exception. Ex-cep-tion!</font>

65
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,200
<font color="yellow">Mom, stay here for just a bit.</font>

66
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,240
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

67
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:43,040
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'll be just fine here
until Dad isn't mad anymore.</font>

68
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,140
<font color="yellow">You've now chosen to live
as Kang Ji Woon.</font>

69
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,940
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a choice.
It was coercion.</font>

70
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,740
<font color="yellow">But you know, I only came here
because there's something I want to know.</font>

71
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,940
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of "Han Ji Woon"?</font>

72
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,940
<font color="yellow">What sort of man was my father
that he abandoned my mother and myself?</font>

73
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,140
<font color="yellow">And why I was forced
to live as Han Ji Woon!</font>

74
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,940
<font color="yellow">I need to find all of this out
for myself.</font>

75
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,040
<font color="yellow">Sure, try and find out for yourself.</font>

76
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,640
<font color="yellow">However, as long as
you live under this roof</font>

77
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,540
<font color="yellow">don't you dare
oppose the Chairman's will</font>

78
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,040
<font color="yellow">Why is there such a big dining room table
when only three people live here?</font>

79
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

80
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,840
<font color="yellow">Oh, um... I was hungry.</font>

81
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,440
<font color="yellow">If you're a newcomer, you should've
come and said hello first.</font>

82
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,740
<font color="yellow">Why are you sneaking around
like a stray cat?</font>

83
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,140
<font color="yellow">Geez, things have really gone downhill
around here ever since Butler Kim left!</font>

84
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,840
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

85
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:17,440
<font color="yellow">So, child, what's your name?
How old are you?</font>

86
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,740
<font color="yellow">My name is Eun Ha Won,
and I'm twenty years old.</font>

87
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,740
<font color="yellow">Call me Ms. Beolgyo.</font>

88
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,540
<font color="yellow">Because I'm from Beolgyo, in the south.
Do you know where that is?</font>

89
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,940
<font color="yellow">Um, yes!</font>

90
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,740
<font color="yellow">- It's famous for blood cockles.
- Yes.</font>

91
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,330
<font color="yellow">You'll have a hard time
if the young masters see you here.</font>

92
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,840
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

93
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you so slow?
Did you eat a turtle or something?</font>

94
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,240
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

95
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,540
<font color="yellow">Um, where are we going?</font>

96
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,840
<font color="yellow">Shush! I told you, we'll be
in trouble if we're caught!</font>

97
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,820
<font color="yellow">All right, you can stay here from now on</font>

98
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,540
<font color="yellow">so don't you dare move,
and just stay here!</font>

99
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,940
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I like this place better!</font>

100
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,740
<font color="yellow">Of course you do.
I'll bet you love it!</font>

101
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,540
<font color="yellow">Why are you here, Miss?</font>

102
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,540
<font color="yellow">Mister!</font>

103
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,240
<font color="yellow">Oh, have you two
already been introduced?</font>

104
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,140
<font color="yellow">This is the youngest one
working with us now--</font>

105
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,340
<font color="yellow">She's not here to work.</font>

106
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,840
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

107
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,040
<font color="yellow">She's the Chairman's special guest.
Please mind your manners.</font>

108
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,540
<font color="yellow">What? The Chairman's special guest?</font>

109
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,340
<font color="yellow">Oh my, forgive me!</font>

110
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's okay!
I'm just here as a part-timer.</font>

111
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not a special guest!</font>

112
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,830
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it seems like
I've made a terrible mistake.</font>

113
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,740
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

114
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,040
<font color="yellow">You should've said
something sooner, Miss!</font>

115
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,540
<font color="yellow">Let us go.</font>

116
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:59,710
<font color="yellow">It's really okay.
Don't worry too much, okay?</font>

117
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,840
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

118
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,600
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Miss!</font>

119
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,340
<font color="yellow">What the heck?</font>

120
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,140
<font color="yellow">Weren't you being a bit much?</font>

121
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
<font color="yellow">She's a lot older than me, too!</font>

122
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,140
<font color="yellow">And yet, you were all like,
"please mind your manners."</font>

123
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,740
<font color="yellow">That's not very nice!</font>

124
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,540
<font color="yellow">All the employees in this estate
must serve you with respect.</font>

125
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,530
<font color="yellow">I'm just a fellow employee!</font>

126
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,540
<font color="yellow">So people don't need to
give me special treatment--</font>

127
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,340
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman's command.</font>

128
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,740
<font color="yellow">But still, she's much older than I am--</font>

129
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,340
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman's command.</font>

130
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,440
<font color="yellow">But still, it's not polite!</font>

131
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,540
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman's command.</font>

132
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,440
<font color="yellow">You haven't eaten yet?</font>

133
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,140
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

134
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,040
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the meal!</font>

135
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,640
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

136
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,540
<font color="yellow">Would you like some, too?</font>

137
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,840
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

138
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, we're still "engaged," okay?</font>

139
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,140
<font color="yellow">Stop talking crap.</font>

140
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,240
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're so fearless as the only girl
living in a house full of guys.</font>

141
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,540
<font color="yellow">It'll be safer for you
to live here as my fiancée.</font>

142
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,140
<font color="yellow">How about you just back off?</font>

143
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,140
<font color="yellow">Are you going to tell everyone
that you put on that act for money?</font>

144
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,540
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter. That is what I chose
to do back then, anyway.</font>

145
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,140
<font color="yellow">Also, didn't you hear what
Mister said before?</font>

146
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,540
<font color="yellow">Dating is forbidden!</font>

147
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,100
<font color="yellow">I'm not asking you to date me.
Just pretend like you're my fiancée.</font>

148
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,240
<font color="yellow">And why do you need me
to do that, exactly?</font>

149
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,740
<font color="yellow">Is this because I never
paid you for last time?</font>

150
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,840
<font color="yellow">Want me to pay more?</font>

151
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,540
<font color="yellow">I told you, I don't need your money!</font>

152
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,440
<font color="yellow">Then you're doing it for free?</font>

153
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,140
<font color="yellow">Did you manage to fall for me
in this short amount of time?</font>

154
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,940
<font color="yellow">Put your hands up.</font>

155
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

156
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,540
<font color="yellow">Higher.</font>

157
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,340
<font color="yellow">Even higher.</font>

158
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,940
<font color="yellow">Put your hands up.</font>

159
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,540
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

160
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,540
<font color="yellow">Higher.</font>

161
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,140
<font color="yellow">Even higher.</font>

162
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,740
<font color="yellow">I said I'll protect you.</font>

163
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,340
<font color="yellow">And I... told you not to talk crap.</font>

164
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,540
<font color="yellow">Hey! Thanks, girlfriend!</font>

165
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,140
<font color="yellow">How much money did you get this time?</font>

166
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,740
<font color="yellow">How much money did you get this time?</font>

167
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,140
<font color="yellow">Kang Ji Woon, that jerk!</font>

168
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,040
<font color="yellow">Kang Seo Woo makes me
feel at ease, though.</font>

169
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,240
<font color="yellow">But Kang Hyun Min is...</font>

170
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,040
<font color="yellow">Ugh, that playboy!</font>

171
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,840
<font color="yellow"><i>From this point on, dating within
Sky House is strictly forbidden.</i></font>

172
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,740
<font color="yellow"><i>Keep in mind that dating within
the house can get you kicked out.</i></font>

173
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,540
<font color="yellow">It's not like I'm crazy!
Why would I ever date any of them?</font>

174
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,640
<font color="yellow">Let's continue walking
our own paths, huh?</font>

175
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,840
<font color="yellow">And not be a nuisance to each other.</font>

176
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,540
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

177
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,240
<font color="yellow">I thought you said
you weren't coming back.</font>

178
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,340
<font color="yellow">Let's try to see as little
of each other as possible.</font>

179
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,940
<font color="yellow">That's what I want, too.</font>

180
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,940
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I'd love it
if you would just ignore me.</font>

181
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,040
<font color="yellow">But seriously, why did you come back?</font>

182
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,940
<font color="yellow">Mind your own business.</font>

183
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,040
<font color="yellow">It hasn't changed a bit.</font>

184
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,360
<font color="yellow"><i>But seriously, why did you come back?</i></font>

185
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,660
<font color="yellow"><i>And I have to find out why
I was forced to live as Han Ji Woon!</i></font>

186
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,940
<font color="yellow">Sheesh! Ow!</font>

187
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,740
<font color="yellow">Ow, my head! My head.</font>

188
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,240
<font color="yellow">That's right. I slept here last night.</font>

189
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,240
<font color="yellow"><i>Good morning, National Jackpot Girl!
Did anything happen after yesterday?</i></font>

190
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,840
<font color="yellow"><i>I moved into Sky House.
I'll tell you everything later.</i></font>

191
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,040
<font color="yellow"><i>Wow! That's insane!
Send me a pic! Send me a pic!</i></font>

192
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,140
<font color="yellow">A photo?</font>

193
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,740
<font color="yellow">One, two, three.</font>

194
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,240
<font color="yellow">What the heck?
You can totally see into my room!</font>

195
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,140
<font color="yellow">What the heck!</font>

196
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,540
<font color="yellow">And what about...</font>

197
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,940
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

198
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,140
<font color="yellow">What the heck?
Who is that?</font>

199
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,440
<font color="yellow"><i>Girlfriend! I'm not exactly
appropriately dressed right now.</i></font>

200
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,340
<font color="yellow"><i>I understand that you want to see me,
but let's see each other later!</i></font>

201
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,940
<font color="yellow">That's... his room?</font>

202
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,890
<font color="yellow">My room... what the hell?</font>

203
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,140
<font color="yellow">They're so close!
You can see straight into my room!</font>

204
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,340
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

205
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,940
<font color="yellow">Then, whose room is that over there?</font>

206
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,040
<font color="yellow">Who is it?
Who is it?</font>

207
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking into
someone else's room?</font>

208
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,440
<font color="yellow">Um, it's not like that...</font>

209
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,240
<font color="yellow">Then get lost.</font>

210
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,540
<font color="yellow">This is... my room.</font>

211
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,740
<font color="yellow">This is Kang Hyun Min's room.</font>

212
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,340
<font color="yellow">This is Kang Ji Woon's room.</font>

213
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,840
<font color="yellow">What? I'm surrounded on all sides!</font>

214
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,240
<font color="yellow">Put the vegetables and other things
like that on top, and the seafood...</font>

215
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,840
<font color="yellow">Wow. This is crazy.</font>

216
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,940
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you eating?</font>

217
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,340
<font color="yellow">I feel kind of bad,
eating before anyone else.</font>

218
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,240
<font color="yellow">Don't worry and eat.
None of them will come.</font>

219
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,940
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

220
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,740
<font color="yellow">Because the three of them have
yet to sit down for a meal together.</font>

221
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,740
<font color="yellow">Not even once?
What do you do with all of this, then?</font>

222
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,640
<font color="yellow">We have our way of taking care of it.</font>

223
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,540
<font color="yellow">Wow, what a waste!</font>

224
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,640
<font color="yellow">So eat to your heart's content.</font>

225
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,440
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman.</font>

226
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,340
<font color="yellow">Aloha!</font>

227
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,940
<font color="yellow">Hello, Chairman!</font>

228
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,040
<font color="yellow">So, how was your first night
at Sky House?</font>

229
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,540
<font color="yellow">Um, I'm not sure yet.</font>

230
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,640
<font color="yellow">I see. All right, then.
Try eating with all of them together.</font>

231
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

232
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,640
<font color="yellow">Eat with them?</font>

233
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,440
<font color="yellow">That's your first mission.</font>

234
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,840
<font color="yellow">Well, I'll be in touch! Aloha!</font>

235
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,940
<font color="yellow"><i>[Contract]</i></font>

236
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,140
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

237
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,140
<font color="yellow">It's a contract that
the Chairman had prepared.</font>

238
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,640
<font color="yellow">A... contract?</font>

239
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,540
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll explain it to you briefly.</font>

240
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,290
<font color="yellow">You'll be provided with a bonus</font>

241
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,640
<font color="yellow">every time you successfully complete
one of the Chairman's missions.</font>

242
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
<font color="yellow">A bonus?</font>

243
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,640
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

244
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,540
<font color="yellow">The reward will be proportional
to the difficulty of the mission.</font>

245
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,940
<font color="yellow">- What?
- But if you fail the mission</font>

246
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,140
<font color="yellow">you must leave Sky House.</font>

247
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

248
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,040
<font color="yellow">And as I told you yesterday,
dating is strictly forbidden.</font>

249
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,240
<font color="yellow">All you have to do is refrain
from dating anyone.</font>

250
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,340
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

251
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,040
<font color="yellow">- Oh, about her...
- Huh?</font>

252
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,340
<font color="yellow">About that girl, Ha Won...</font>

253
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she won't last a week
and crawl back here.</font>

254
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,840
<font color="yellow">Don't you dare let her back in.</font>

255
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,240
<font color="yellow">Of course not!</font>

256
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,140
<font color="yellow">But, um... Honey.</font>

257
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,340
<font color="yellow">Did your past wife
really cheat on you, and...</font>

258
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,640
<font color="yellow">Don't ever bring that up again!</font>

259
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,140
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay. Sure.</font>

260
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,640
<font color="yellow">Yoo Na!
Dad's leaving!</font>

261
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,140
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Don't wake her up.</font>

262
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,940
<font color="yellow">This time, I'm working on constructing
an apartment, so it may take a while.</font>

263
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,340
<font color="yellow">I'll call you later.</font>

264
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,740
<font color="yellow">All right.
Be careful!</font>

265
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,340
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

266
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,040
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you calling
because you saw the flyer?</font>

267
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,740
<font color="yellow"><i>[Looking for Mr. Kang Young Jin,
who lived at Yeongak Apartment, Unit 308]</i></font>

Apartment ten years ago?</font>

Who is this?</font>

276
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,740

Ms. Eun Ha Won's belongings?</font>

277
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,340
<font color="yellow">Please, have some tea.</font>

278
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

279
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,940
<font color="yellow">Oh... all right.</font>

280
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,140
<font color="yellow">But, um, how did our Ha Won
get to live at Sky House?</font>

281
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,240
<font color="yellow">She received an invitation to do so
from Chairman Kang Jong Du.</font>

282
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,740
<font color="yellow">She was invited... by the chairman?</font>

283
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
<font color="yellow">- But, why?
- You mean, that girl, Eun Ha Won did?</font>

at a later time.</font>

286
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,340
<font color="yellow">Wait, already?</font>

287
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,410
<font color="yellow">Wait. Yoo Na!
Give him a proper farewell.</font>

288
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,340
<font color="yellow">He's the General Secretary
for Haneul Group!</font>

289
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,140
<font color="yellow">Oh. Goodbye!</font>

290
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Did her father go somewhere?</font>

291
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,340
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm doing some really
important work or something!</font>

292
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,040
<font color="yellow">Shall I get started now, then?</font>

293
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,940
<font color="yellow">What's so hard about getting them
to eat a meal together?</font>

294
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,840
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

295
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,740
<font color="yellow">How is there not a single
family photo in such a huge house?</font>

296
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ms. Celebrity!
I picked this up at the hotel.</font>

297
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

298
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,340
<font color="yellow">I was looking for this
for a really long time!</font>

299
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,840
<font color="yellow">Wow!</font>

300
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,740
<font color="yellow">But, did something happen last night?</font>

301
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,340
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

302
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,040
<font color="yellow">You seemed like you were crying...</font>

303
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,410
<font color="yellow">Oh... I wasn't crying.</font>

304
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,140
<font color="yellow">It's just because
I got caught in the rain.</font>

305
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,630
<font color="yellow">Oh! I see.</font>

306
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,140
<font color="yellow">I thought that something happened
with your family or something!</font>

307
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,440
<font color="yellow">Why did you think that?</font>

308
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,560
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

309
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,140
<font color="yellow">Oh, um, just because.</font>

310
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,940
<font color="yellow">Yeah.
Just because.</font>

311
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,740
<font color="yellow">Deleting my texts
wasn't on accident, was it?</font>

312
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,340
<font color="yellow">Of course it was an accident!</font>

313
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,240
<font color="yellow">Were those texts that bad?</font>

314
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,540
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

315
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,840
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

316
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,940
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

317
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:35,040
<font color="yellow">I deleted them because I thought
they would hurt your feelings!</font>

318
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,940
<font color="yellow">I mean, is that Yoo Na or whoever
really a part of your family?</font>

319
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,040
<font color="yellow">It's the first time I've seen sisters
who share such a bad relationship!</font>

320
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,840
<font color="yellow">Our relationship isn't as bad as your
relationship with your cousins, though.</font>

321
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,640
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

322
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,140
<font color="yellow">I heard that the three of you
have never even eaten together.</font>

323
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,840
<font color="yellow">What kind of family is that?</font>

324
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,940
<font color="yellow">I still ate with my family every day
even if only for appearance's sake.</font>

325
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,840
<font color="yellow">You're such a kind person.</font>

326
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,040
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,
how about we all eat together?</font>

327
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,840
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you looking at?</font>

328
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,840
<font color="yellow">You saw that, right?
He definitely won't eat with us.</font>

329
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,840
<font color="yellow">Huh? What is that?</font>

330
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,040
<font color="yellow">This is Lee Yoon Sung.</font>

331
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,140
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

332
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,840
<font color="yellow">Is it a hobby of yours to invade
other people's personal space?</font>

333
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,040
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep hanging around me?
You shouldn't be in here.</font>

334
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,140
<font color="yellow">What's so special about this place?</font>

335
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,240
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

336
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

337
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,340
<font color="yellow">What made you think
it's okay to live here?</font>

338
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,340
<font color="yellow">I have my reasons.</font>

339
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,440
<font color="yellow">Living here won't be as simple
as you may think.</font>

340
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,940
<font color="yellow">I'm aware.</font>

341
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,840
<font color="yellow">No, I don't think you are.</font>

342
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,340
<font color="yellow">I came here to protect something
that's important to me.</font>

343
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,740
<font color="yellow">What's important to you
is money, isn't it?</font>

344
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,640
<font color="yellow">I told you, it's not like that!</font>

345
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,940
<font color="yellow">What, then? Are you going to try
and seduce me or something?</font>

346
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,740
<font color="yellow">You really must be out of your mind.</font>

347
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,340
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you doing?</font>

348
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,740
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you never to
lay a hand on me again?</font>

349
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,140
<font color="yellow">Oh no!
What do I do?</font>

350
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,540
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

351
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,540
<font color="yellow">Oh no.</font>

352
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,040
<font color="yellow">This is the reality of my life, huh?</font>

353
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,140
<font color="yellow">What's that girl doing over there?</font>

354
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,740
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ms. Celebrity!
What are you doing over there?</font>

355
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,940
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you crazy?
Do you enjoy taking cold baths?</font>

356
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,640
<font color="yellow">And what's with all this garbage?</font>

357
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,940
<font color="yellow">It's not garbage.
These are my belongings.</font>

358
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,140
<font color="yellow">This stuff?</font>

359
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, you're going to catch a cold!
Can't you just throw these things away?</font>

360
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,340
<font color="yellow">Why would I throw my stuff away?</font>

361
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,940
<font color="yellow">Go back inside, you two.</font>

362
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,740
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.
How ridiculous.</font>

363
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,740
<font color="yellow">Hold on!</font>

364
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,640
<font color="yellow">Hey, you can throw
those kinds of things away!</font>

365
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,340
<font color="yellow">I can use this sample
for three whole days!</font>

366
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,540
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

367
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,340
<font color="yellow">Get out of there!</font>

368
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,640
<font color="yellow">Let's go back inside.
It's pretty cold.</font>

369
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,340
<font color="yellow">It's fine. You two can go inside.</font>

370
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,540
<font color="yellow">Did you force your way in here
to be treated like this?</font>

371
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,500
<font color="yellow">How about you take care
of your own things</font>

372
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,640
<font color="yellow">instead of making other people
worry about you?</font>

373
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,040
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Don't worry about her.</font>

374
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,240
<font color="yellow">Because I'll be the one
to worry about her.</font>

375
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,430
<font color="yellow">Then make sure she's not
in my face all the time.</font>

376
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,940
<font color="yellow">Or why don't you just get lost?</font>

377
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,540
<font color="yellow">You heard him, right?
He told me to get lost.</font>

378
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,040
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that she's
your newest toy or something?</font>

379
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,240
<font color="yellow">Why, do you want it or something?</font>

380
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,540
<font color="yellow">Stop it, already.</font>

381
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,770
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about them.</font>

382
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,040
<font color="yellow">They're like this every time
they see each other.</font>

383
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,340
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Leave me alone,
all three of you!</font>

384
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,840
<font color="yellow">How many times has it been already?</font>

385
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,440
<font color="yellow">How many times has it been already?</font>

386
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,740
<font color="yellow">I apologize. I should've been
more careful with your belongings.</font>

387
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:56,140
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's okay, Mister.
Thank you for bringing everything here.</font>

388
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,940
<font color="yellow">Let us go.
The car is waiting.</font>

389
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,240
<font color="yellow">Go where?</font>

390
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,340
<font color="yellow">Mister. Are we filming
"Pretty Woman" right now?</font>

391
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,240
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman's command.</font>

392
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,540
<font color="yellow">I told you, I'm okay with
having this one outfit!</font>

393
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:22,340
<font color="yellow">Um, then I'll pick out
a few things for you.</font>

394
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,640
<font color="yellow">- It's the Chairman's--
- "It's the Chairman's command."</font>

395
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
<font color="yellow">That's what you were about
to say just now, right?</font>

396
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,940
<font color="yellow">I might just go and return
everything you buy, okay?</font>

397
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,940
<font color="yellow">Then how about you go to
the cafe and rest a bit?</font>

398
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,740
<font color="yellow">Mister!</font>

399
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,540
<font color="yellow">Please go there and wait for me.</font>

400
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,840
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

401
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,240
<font color="yellow">- Oh my!
- Oh no!</font>

402
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,140
<font color="yellow">Oh my! What the hell?
You should be more careful!</font>

403
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,140
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

404
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,940
<font color="yellow">Oh no, my crocodile skin bag!
It got scratched!</font>

405
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,540
<font color="yellow">Oh no, my crocodile skin bag!</font>

406
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

407
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,540
<font color="yellow">You think your apology will fix this?
It got scratched because you bumped me!</font>

408
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,140
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- What do you think you're touching?</font>

409
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,940
<font color="yellow">This cost me 30 million won, you know!
It's worth 30 million won!</font>

410
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,540
<font color="yellow">Pay me back for this bag!
Pay me back!</font>

411
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,440
<font color="yellow">Really, now?</font>

412
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,740
<font color="yellow">Who the hell are you?</font>

413
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,940
<font color="yellow">A genuine article has five stitches
on both sides of the logo.</font>

414
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,340
<font color="yellow">But yours isn't like that.</font>

415
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,370
<font color="yellow">This material obviously
isn't even S-level quality.</font>

416
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,340
<font color="yellow">Where did you buy this?</font>

417
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,440
<font color="yellow">Oh my. How is that any of your business?</font>

418
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,440
<font color="yellow">Looks like we've run into
each other again.</font>

419
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,940
<font color="yellow">Oh... yeah.</font>

420
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,640
<font color="yellow">Did you come to do some shopping?</font>

421
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,840
<font color="yellow">Um, no. I'm just waiting for someone.</font>

422
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,040
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

423
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,740
<font color="yellow">I guess we tend to run into each other
at the most inopportune moments.</font>

424
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,240
<font color="yellow">Thanks so much for earlier.
I was freaking out like crazy!</font>

425
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,940
<font color="yellow">It was obvious that lady
was being really weird.</font>

426
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,740
<font color="yellow">But, how did you know
that the bag was a fake?</font>

427
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,340
<font color="yellow">People who do a lot of needlework
tend to know these things.</font>

428
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,540
<font color="yellow">Needlework?</font>

429
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,940
<font color="yellow">I have a lot of interest
in fashion design, you see.</font>

430
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,440
<font color="yellow">I'm planning to major in
fashion design in college.</font>

431
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,740
<font color="yellow">Oh, no wonder you're
always dressed so well!</font>

432
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,840
<font color="yellow">You don't seem like a person
from "that world," either.</font>

433
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,340
<font color="yellow">"Either"? So, you're not, either?</font>

434
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,940
<font color="yellow">You didn't know, huh?</font>

435
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,340
<font color="yellow">I'm not from a super-rich family
like those guys are.</font>

436
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,140
<font color="yellow">Oh... I thought you'd
definitely be one of them.</font>

437
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,640
<font color="yellow">Hyun Min and I have lived in the same
neighborhood ever since we were kids.</font>

438
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,940
<font color="yellow">So we've been close since then.</font>

439
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,340
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

440
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,740
<font color="yellow">How did you meet Hyun Min?</font>

441
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,840
<font color="yellow">Um, well, that is...</font>

442
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:19,940
<font color="yellow">He came by the convenience store
where I work part-time...</font>

443
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,540
<font color="yellow">- So, um...
- A convenience store?</font>

444
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,040
<font color="yellow">Yeah, so...</font>

445
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,240
<font color="yellow">I'm being too nosy. I'm sorry.</font>

446
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,940
<font color="yellow">No, it's okay.</font>

447
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,880
<font color="yellow">I did know that Hyun Min dates around</font>

448
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,540
<font color="yellow">but he's never introduced
anyone as his fiancée.</font>

449
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

450
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,340
<font color="yellow">I guess you're happy.</font>

451
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,940
<font color="yellow">Huh?
About what?</font>

452
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,240
<font color="yellow">Um, to be officially dating Hyun Min.</font>

453
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,540
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

454
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,940
<font color="yellow">I'm finished shopping, Ms. Ha Won.</font>

455
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,040
<font color="yellow">Shall we head back now?</font>

456
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,740
<font color="yellow">Yoon Sung?</font>

457
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:13,040
<font color="yellow">Why are you shopping for her?</font>

458
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,440
<font color="yellow">Did Hyun Min tell him
to do this for you?</font>

459
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,140
<font color="yellow">- Um...
- No.</font>

460
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,240
<font color="yellow">Ms. Eun Ha Won is living at Sky House,
so I'm taking care of her.</font>

461
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
<font color="yellow">She's living at Sky House?</font>

462
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,540
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

463
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,640
<font color="yellow">So the person you were waiting for
was Yoon Sung?</font>

464
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,340
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

465
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,840
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I'll get going.</font>

466
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,940
<font color="yellow">Shall we go?</font>

467
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,340
<font color="yellow">Um, but, why did you buy
so many things, Mister?</font>

468
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,940
<font color="yellow">I told you that I'd return everything!</font>

469
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,940
<font color="yellow">It's the Chairman's command.</font>

470
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,140
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mister!</font>

471
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,040
<font color="yellow">I have duties
that I must fulfill, after all.</font>

472
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,340
<font color="yellow">But still, this is way too much.</font>

473
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,940
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that you've been having
a hard time due to the Kang Cousins.</font>

474
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,640
<font color="yellow">I'll be sure to take care of you now,
so that you won't be troubled anymore.</font>

475
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,740
<font color="yellow">That's also the Chairman's command.</font>

476
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,740
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

477
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,640
<font color="yellow">I'll apologize on behalf
of those three boys.</font>

478
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Ms. Ha Won.</font>

479
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,140
<font color="yellow">No, no, Mister!</font>

480
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,740
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

481
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,340
<font color="yellow">I'll just wear this one thing.</font>

482
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,840
<font color="yellow">It's because it makes me
feel bad to accept all this.</font>

483
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:52,840
<font color="yellow">Let's hurry and return
the rest, okay? Let's go!</font>

484
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,940
<font color="yellow">Come on, let's go!</font>

485
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,040
<font color="yellow">Eun Ha Won's friend, Kim Ja Young!</font>

486
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,940
<font color="yellow">It's Hong Ja Young, actually.</font>

487
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,340
<font color="yellow">Who the hell cares?</font>

488
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,240
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

489
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,240
<font color="yellow">You know who I am, right?</font>

490
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:35,040
<font color="yellow">I heard that girl, Eun Ha Won,
is living at Sky House?</font>

491
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,740
<font color="yellow">Oh... um, no!
I don't think so.</font>

492
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,840
<font color="yellow">"I don't 'think' so?"</font>

493
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,540
<font color="yellow">It's not even a "No",
but an "I don't think so"?</font>

494
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,540
<font color="yellow">You know something, don't you?</font>

495
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,940
<font color="yellow">Spit it out.</font>

496
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,840
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and spit it out!</font>

497
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,640
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything.
Really. I don't know.</font>

498
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,940
<font color="yellow">What the hell are you saying?</font>

499
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,640
<font color="yellow">I really don't know.</font>

500
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,540
<font color="yellow">Give me your phone.</font>

501
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,140
<font color="yellow">Why do you want someone else's phone?</font>

502
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,440
<font color="yellow">Let me see!</font>

503
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,140
<font color="yellow">So... it was true.</font>

504
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,040
<font color="yellow">Wow, I'm so jealous.
You are too, right?</font>

505
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,440
<font color="yellow">Why the hell would I be jealous?</font>

506
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,940
<font color="yellow">Happy now?</font>

507
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,710
<font color="yellow">Hey, give that back.</font>

508
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,940
<font color="yellow">How do you know
if that's really Sky House?</font>

509
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,440
<font color="yellow">No. I'm busy!</font>

510
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,840
<font color="yellow">Hey, let me see!</font>

511
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:51,340
<font color="yellow">What... am I holding
in my hand right now?</font>

512
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:56,440
<font color="yellow">I don't know.
Three-day-old toilet paper?</font>

513
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:07,040
<font color="yellow">Mommy! Ew!
Oh my gosh! Mommy!</font>

514
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, I guess it's Eun Ha Won's.</font>

515
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,940
<font color="yellow">How cute.</font>

516
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,540
<font color="yellow"><i>[Payment of 3,995,000 won
to Haneul Crematorium]</i></font>

517
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,940
<font color="yellow">She only has 800 won left?</font>

518
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,440
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

519
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,140
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much about me.</font>

520
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,340
<font color="yellow">The part-time jobs I took on before
and the work I'm doing now</font>

521
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:07,540
<font color="yellow">are all just jobs for me to earn money.</font>

522
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,340
<font color="yellow">I don't have any reason
to feel hurt by them.</font>

523
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,740
<font color="yellow">I've experienced far worse.</font>

524
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,040
<font color="yellow">You're not just a part-timer.</font>

525
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,240
<font color="yellow">You're our precious guest.</font>

526
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,440
<font color="yellow">Even so, I'm going to do all the work
that the Chairman asks me to do</font>

527
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,940
<font color="yellow">before I leave Sky House.</font>

528
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,440
<font color="yellow">My life is on the line, after all.
I can do it!</font>

529
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,140
<font color="yellow"><i>Ms. Eun Ha Won is living at Sky House now</i></font>

530
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,740
<font color="yellow"><i>so I'm taking care of her.</i></font>

531
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,440
<font color="yellow">I really don't get it.</font>

532
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,740
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

533
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,440
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you something?</font>

534
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,340
<font color="yellow">I heard that Hyun Min's fiancée
is living at Sky House now?</font>

535
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,740
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

536
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,540
<font color="yellow">So it is true.</font>

537
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,340
<font color="yellow">It just ended up this way, somehow.</font>

538
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,840
<font color="yellow">This is so frustrating.
I can't take this anymore.</font>

539
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,540
<font color="yellow">I don't think you'd tell me,
so I'll have to go ask Hyun Min myself.</font>

540
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,940
<font color="yellow">Right now?</font>

541
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ms. Celebrity!</font>

542
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,440
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

543
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,540
<font color="yellow">Did you go out with Yoon Sung?</font>

544
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah. My clothes all got wet,
so he bought me some new ones.</font>

545
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,440
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.</font>

546
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,340
<font color="yellow">This is yours, right?</font>

547
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:26,240
<font color="yellow">Oh... where did you find this?</font>

548
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,740
<font color="yellow">It was on the floor.</font>

549
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,640
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

550
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,940
<font color="yellow">Thanks for finding this for me.</font>

551
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,340
<font color="yellow">But, um, did you...</font>

552
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,740
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I looked inside.</font>

553
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,440
<font color="yellow">Oh, you did?</font>

554
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,540
<font color="yellow">I mean, just in case it wasn't yours,
I was trying to find who it belonged to.</font>

555
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:53,440
<font color="yellow">Who else in this house would
have a bank book like this?</font>

556
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,240
<font color="yellow">You seem more like yourself now.</font>

557
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,740
<font color="yellow">But it seems that I keep learning
all your secrets, bit by bit.</font>

558
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,240
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

559
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,030
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on!</font>

560
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,540
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that
a high schooler has no money.</font>

561
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,640
<font color="yellow">What about you guys, then?</font>

562
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,240
<font color="yellow">Um, us?
Well, we're...</font>

563
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,940
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

564
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,140
<font color="yellow">You guys have your own world,
and I have mine.</font>

565
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,340
<font color="yellow">It's just that our worlds are
overlapping for a short while.</font>

566
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,440
<font color="yellow">Hearing you say that saddens me.</font>

567
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,540
<font color="yellow">No, no. My world is right here.</font>

568
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,440
<font color="yellow">And I just realized once more
that I can't forget that.</font>

569
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,540
<font color="yellow">I wasn't talking about that part.</font>

570
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,340
<font color="yellow">You said that our worlds are
only overlapping for a short while.</font>

571
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,940
<font color="yellow">Yeah, just for a short while.</font>

572
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,340
<font color="yellow">Are you going to briefly
stay with Hyun Min</font>

573
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,940
<font color="yellow">and then break off
your engagement?</font>

574
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,040
<font color="yellow">Oh. Well, um, that's...</font>

575
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,840
<font color="yellow">Or are you a bigger Casanova
than Kang Hyun Min himself?</font>

576
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,440
<font color="yellow">Kang Seo Woo,
don't try to pry too much.</font>

577
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,840
<font color="yellow">You'll end up getting hurt!</font>

578
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,840
<font color="yellow">Who left this here?</font>

579
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, was it Mister?</font>

580
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,240
<font color="yellow"><i>[Asshole Kang Hyun Min]</i></font>

581

582
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,640

I have something to give you.</i></font>

583
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,540
<font color="yellow"><i>- Where?
- My room.</i></font>

584

<font color="yellow"><i>Nope nope.</i></font>

585
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,140
<font color="yellow"><i>I said I have something to give you!</i></font>

586
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,340
<font color="yellow"><i>No thanks!</i></font>

587
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,440
<font color="yellow"><i>You'll be surprised and touched
if you see it! Seriously!</i></font>

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,940
<font color="yellow">Wow, did I just get ignored?</font>

589
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

590
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,540
<font color="yellow">Stay right there.</font>

591
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,840
<font color="yellow">What the hell?</font>

00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,940
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's my uniform!</font>

Hurry up and give it back!</font>

594
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,140
<font color="yellow">Come and get it.</font>

595
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,240
<font color="yellow">What the hell?
Hurry up and give it to me!</font>

596
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,440
<font color="yellow">Hmm, can I cut one of the arms off?</font>

597
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,440
<font color="yellow">The spring/summer season
is approaching.</font>

598
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,940
<font color="yellow">Hey. No! No!</font>

599
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,740
<font color="yellow">I have to wear that to my graduation!</font>

600
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,940
<font color="yellow">No, no, please!
Give it back!</font>

601
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,040
<font color="yellow">Hey, slow down. You're making a lot
of sudden movements right now.</font>

602
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,240
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine.</font>

603
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,640
<font color="yellow">Come on, hurry up!
Hurry and give it back!</font>

604
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,240
<font color="yellow">Are you holding my uniform hostage?</font>

605
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,240
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

606
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,740
<font color="yellow">- No, you can't!
- Hey!</font>

607
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,440
<font color="yellow">You're the first girl who has
ever entered my room.</font>

608
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,540
<font color="yellow">Sorry. Can you forget
about that, please?</font>

609
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,440
<font color="yellow">Hey, I even got this
dry-cleaned for you!</font>

610
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,940
<font color="yellow">Give it back.</font>

611
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,140
<font color="yellow">Want to have some ramen
before you go?</font>

612
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,640
<font color="yellow">We can put some caviar in it.</font>

613
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,630
<font color="yellow">You know, there are only
two types of customers</font>

614
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,940
<font color="yellow">that come to convenience
stores after 4 a.m.</font>

615
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,040
<font color="yellow">People who are going to work early,
and good-for-nothings still partying.</font>

616
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,440
<font color="yellow">And the worst of the lot
always come on strong, like you.</font>

617
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,740
<font color="yellow">Are you comparing your one-and-only-honey
to those types of guys?</font>

618
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,440
<font color="yellow">That's not very nice.</font>

619
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,240
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I do
when that happens to me?</font>

620
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,240
<font color="yellow">What do you do?</font>

621
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,640

00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,340
<font color="yellow">Oh, are you going to
come on to me, then?</font>

625
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,440
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

626
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,840
<font color="yellow">Was I a bit too forward with you?</font>

627
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,340
<font color="yellow">You sure are unpredictable,
Eun Ha Won.</font>
