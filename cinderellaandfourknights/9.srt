4
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Ow, my head.

5
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:05,800
Wow, that was one strange dream.

6
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,800
Oof!

7
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,499
Oh my gosh, I must be crazy!

8
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:10,399
Wait, why am I happy?
Stop it! I'm not happy!

9
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,899
I must be crazy!

10
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:13,499
Oh man, I really must be crazy!

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,499
Come on, Eun Ha Won!
Get it together, girl!

12
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:28,499
What's going on?

13
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,700
Hey, Eun Ha Won!
Are you okay?

14
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,999
Ha Won!

15
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,399
It seems like a minor concussion.

16
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,800
Will she regain consciousness soon?

17
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,399
Yes. She's merely asleep right now.

18
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:15,300
Then, is it okay for us to transfer
the patient to a facility in Seoul?

19
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,100
Yes. If there's a hospital that she
regularly goes to, you can do that.

20
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
I'm sure she'll be getting up soon.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
All right. I'll go and take care of
her discharge paperwork, then.

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
All right.

23
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:37,399
Yeah. I'll take Ms. Ha Won to Seoul

24
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:40,200
so I think it'd be best for you guys
to find your own way home.

25
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
All right. Do that, then.

26
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,499
You don't need to worry.

27
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,300
He says that she's fine.
Yoon Sung said he'll take her to Seoul.

28
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,600
What about us, then?
We don't need to go see her?

29
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
Right. He said that it was
only a minor concussion

30
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,199
and he wants us to go home and wait.

31
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:02,400
Just how did she manage to fall over
in the bathroom, and get a concussion?

32
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,300
She really is...

33
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,300
She really is a weird girl.

34
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,499
Let's pack our things
and hurry back home.

35
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:19,600
Yeah. It's not like we'd do anything by
ourselves without her around, anyway.

36
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,300
Aren't you going to go
and pack your things?

37
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,999
What?

38
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,499
It won't take me too long to pack.

39
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:31,800
I'll pack my things too,
and come out, then.

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,100
Wait for me.

41
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:03,199
Um, excuse me.

42
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,600
Oh, you're awake?

43
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,100
What day is it today?

44
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,100
It's the 15th.

45
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Huh?

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
What the...

47
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,499
not even a single day has gone by?

48
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:21,499
Excuse me?

49
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:25,199
I mean, usually when people
pass out and stuff

50
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,900
and then wake up,
a week or so has gone by.

51
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,400
Isn't that how it usually is?

52
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,300
Thankfully, that's not the
case with you, so don't worry.

53
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:38,199
Hey, are you okay?

54
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,499
Oh, um... yeah, I think so.

55
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:46,900
I was super worried about you because
you were passed out in the bathroom!

56
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,800
- Aw, you were?
- Yeah!

57
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,199
Oh yeah! Where's everyone else?

58
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,800
Mr. Yoon Sung only brought you here.
He was in a huge rush.

59
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,100
Oh. But, um, Ja Young.

60
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,999
When people usually pass out, don't
people get temporary amnesia

61
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:08,100
or something like that, and not remember
anything that happened the night before?

62
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,300
What's with you?

63
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,300
Oh, never mind.
It's nothing.

64
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,425
- Are you really okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

65
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,999
I was quite worried about you.
I'm quite relieved.

66
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:39,699
Oh. I'm sorry, Mister.
Because of me, you...

67
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,400
Oh, let's hurry back!
I'm sure the rest of them are waiting.

68
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,499
No. You must go to Seoul
and get a cast put on your leg.

69
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,600
I've made an appointment for you at a
hospital that is owned by Haneul Group.

70
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,800
All they did here
was emergency first aid.

71
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,300
A cast?

72
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,400
They said that you
sprained your ankle, too.

73
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh man, are you serious?

74
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,800
Please get on.
I'll escort you to the car.

75
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:20,600
Huh? She left all her clothes here.

76
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,999
How tacky.

77
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Why does she always focus on
such unimportant things?

78
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,199
What are you doing?

79
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,300
Huh?

80
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,999
Oh, nothing.

81
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Let's go.

82
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:01,600
What about everyone else?

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,199
They've taken another car,
and are on their way back to Seoul.

84
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh. Did I cut this trip short
for everyone?

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,099
It's quite all right, Ms. Ha Won.

86
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:13,099
None of them would've come
if it hadn't been for you, anyway.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,599
What is it?

88
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,199
You seemed to have quite
a low tolerance for alcohol!

89
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,400
You didn't even seem like you had a lot,
but you passed out before we knew it!

90
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,099
I saw a side of you that
I've never seen, Mister!

91
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:33,319
Please... um... erase that memory
from your mind, ma'am.

92
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:36,500
Oh, your face is all red, Mister!

93
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,599
I... suppose that you didn't
get drunk, then, Ms. Ha Won?

94
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,400
Well, I--

95
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,800
No. I was super drunk last night, too.

96
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,199
And because of that, I don't remember
a single thing that happened last night.

97
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:52,400
Did something happen last night?

98
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Um, no.
Nothing happened.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
But you just said that you
don't remember anything.

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, that is...

101
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:04,400
Yes, um, I don't remember anything.
But nothing really happened.

102
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,599
You've stretched the tendon
in your ankle.

103
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,800
It's not a serious injury

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,199
so you'll be fine if you're careful
with it for the next couple of days.

105
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:27,099
Yes, thank you.

106
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,400
Have you used crutches before?

107
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,599
It's hard to get used to them at first,
but they'll be quite useful when you do.

108
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,599
- Can she go now?
- Yes.

109
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,000
Please schedule your next appointment.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,199
And be extra careful
for the next couple of days!

111
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,300
Yes, I will.

112
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,199
Mister!

113
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Let's go.

114
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,000
<i>[Organ Transplantation Center]</i>

115
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,699
Organ Transplantation?

116
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,800
It really won't be easy
to find an organ donor.

117
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,400
Oh... I see.

118
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,300
It'd be best for him to tell their
family about their condition outright

119
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,900
and find a donor among
his family members--

120
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,300
He's staunchly against that idea.

121
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,900
We have no other options
to offer you, at present.

122
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,599
All I can tell you to do now is wait.

123
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:39,500
All right. If you do find a donor,
please contact me.

124
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,900
I will.

125
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,099
- Um, Mister.
- Yes?

126
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,300
Oh, it's nothing.
Let's hurry and go.

127
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,400
We need to talk.

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
About what?

129
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,099
About last night...

130
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:56,699
Oh, that?

131
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,099
Let's just pretend that it didn't happen.

132
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,400
What?

133
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,199
It's simple. Let's just pretend
that none of that happened.

134
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,599
Okay?

135
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,199
What is it?

136
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,400
Did something happen?

137
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,599
Um, no.

138
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,300
Eun Ha Won!

139
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,000
Are you okay? You even
have to use crutches now?

140
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,099
Oh, it's only for a couple of days.

141
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,199
Whoa!

142
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:29,599
I'm fine!

143
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,000
What a shame.
That must be so uncomfortable.

144
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,800
It doesn't hurt, or anything?

145
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,500
They said that I just stretched
my tendon out a bit. I'm fine.

146
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
You should've been careful.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll be your human crutch.

148
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,300
Even though she's not your fiancee?

149
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,699
- Ms. Celebrity! I'll help you.
- No!

150
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,300
Um, it's because I'm not quite
used to them yet. I'll be fine soon.

151
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,900
I'll help you, Ms. Ha Won.

152
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,199
Then, can you hold these for me, Mister?

153
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why is she hopping off like that,
as if she's running away from us?

154
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,099
What's with her now?

155
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,199
Let's go.
I'll take you home.

156
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:50,599
Good work. Ms. Ha Won
is fine now, I presume?

157
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:54,099
Yes. I've brought her back to Sky House.

158
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:57,400
I was planning to get some rest here,
and keep it a secret from the kids.

159
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,599
But instead, I almost got caught.

160
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,099
How long are you planning
to hide your condition, Chairman?

161
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:07,099
I don't know.
Until I die, perhaps?

162
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:11,000
Honey! How could you say
something like that?

163
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:15,500
Is it all right for him
to be discharged?

164
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,000
His hepatic cirrhosis
is getting worse by the day.

165
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,099
It won't be long before
his liver fails completely.

166
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,099
The only option left to us now is...

167
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:26,800
It's fine. Whatever.

168
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,400
- I'll quit drinking, and--
- You must receive a transplant.

169
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
I thought you said you added my name on
the list of people looking for donors.

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,099
Yes. That is true, but a fitting
donor for you has yet to...

171
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,800
Well, I'm sure we'll find one
soon enough.

172
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,000
Isn't that right?

173
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,300
Chairman!

174
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,599
What good will it do anyone to go
around telling everyone that I'm sick?

175
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:49,699
Let's go.

176
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,699
Yes.

177
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,900
I'll take that, ma'am.

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,800
Thank you.

179
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,699
No. This is merely a part of my duty.

180
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,800
It would've been quite nice
if I had a son like you.

181
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,599
You're too kind.

182
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Did something happen
between you and Ha Won yesterday?

183
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,000
Huh?
Um, why?

184
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,400
You two seemed a bit off,
back at Sky House.

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,000
No, I don't know about that.

186
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,599
It kind of seemed as if
Ha Won was avoiding you.

187
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,399
She probably feels embarrassed about
the fact that she tripped and fell over.

188
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,300
Figures. We all drank way too much.
My head still hurts a bit.

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,899
Yeah.

190
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,200
Wow, I feel like I have a really
bad headache coming on.

191
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,099
You were quite cute when
you were drunk, Kang Ji Woon.

192
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,899
Stop messing around, punk!

193
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,099
No, really. It's been a while
since I saw you smiling like that.

194
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Really?

195
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,099
Are you the daughter of the people
who live here, by any chance?

196
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,399
Yes.

197
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:19,599
Is your father home?

198
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,399
No, he went on a business trip.

199
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:22,800
Oh.

200
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,099
Who are you?

201
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,399
Oh, it's nothing.
We'll come back another time.

202
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,700
What's with those guys?

203
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,599
I don't know. Maybe they're
people that my dad knows?

204
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,399
Will you be all right?

205
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:50,399
Yeah. I want to head in,
wash up, and get some rest.

206
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:53,899
All right.

207
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,500
Thanks for dropping me off.

208
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Yes, go ahead.

209
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Really?

210
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,399
I'll head over there right now.

211
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,099
<i>Did something happen
between you and Ha Won?</i>

212
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,800
<i>It seemed like she was avoiding you.</i>

213
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,500
I knew this would happen.

214
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,099
Don't you want my help?

215
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:36,200
I was about to change
into something else.

216
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah.

217
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,000
Get out!

218
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,099
Nah.

219
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,500
Hey!

220
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,000
Wow! Is this really all for Eun Ha Won?

221
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,800
Yeah. She's injured,
so she needs to eat up.

222
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,500
Isn't that right?

223
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,200
Oh, of course!
I'll bring this to her.

224
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,399
- Please be careful.
- All right.

225
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,899
How could this be?
No way. This can't be.

226
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,500
Hey, what about my clothes?
Why don't you have anything with you?

227
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,800
Your wardrobe is a crime against fashion.

228
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,899
There's nothing in there
that's actually worth wearing!

229
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,099
That's not true. I'm sure that there are
tons of things worth wearing in there.

230
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
- Just wait.
- Where are you going?

231
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,899
To buy some clothes that
are actually half-decent!

232
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,800
- Oh my--
- Hey!

233
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,399
- You surprised me!
- You surprised me!

234
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,399
You almost knocked everything over!

235
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:43,000
- And why are you here?
- Oh, for Eun Ha Won.

236
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,200
Food is the most important
thing to her, as you know.

237
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
And what about you?

238
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,300
Oh, I just had a couple of things
I had to take care of.

239
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,000
Get out of my way, already!

240
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,099
Hey, be careful!

241
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:54,599
Why, you little!

242
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,200
Damn it.

243
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:05,700
All right. Ta-da!
Your breakfast!

244
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,099
Wow, Kang Seo Woo!
I'm totally touched!

245
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,099
I'm not the one who made all this.

246
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:21,000
I know. It was probably
Ms. Beolgyo who made this.

247
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
She's quite a generous person!

248
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,399
No, it's not that she's
a generous person.

249
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,700
It's just that you have
a crazy-huge appetite.

250
00:21:36,899 --> 00:21:40,000
- That's weird.
- What?

251
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,099
Why are you eating so little?

252
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:44,599
I don't really have much of an appetite.

253
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,599
What?

254
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,099
Wait a second.

255
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,399
I'm fine.

256
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:57,500
How could this be?
Eun Ha Won has no appetite?

257
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,000
Did you hurt another part of
your body besides just your leg?

258
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,300
Oh! Did you get
a bump on your head?

259
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Maybe your concussion
affected your brain somehow?

260
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,700
I'm telling you, I'm fine!

261
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
- Really?
- Yeah!

262
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,300
It tastes good.

263
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,099
Looks like I'll have to eat a ton,
seeing as how you're freaking out

264
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:25,899
You're even taking care of me
like this because I'm sick! Thanks.

265
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:29,500
I have to go on a music show tomorrow,
though, so I won't be home all day.

266
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
It's fine. I'll be okay on my own.

267
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,000
- Really?
- Of course!

268
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:43,000
Eun Ha Won.

269
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,099
Yeah?

270
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,399
Did you even wash your face today?

271
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,800
- Nope.
- Hey!

272
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,000
See? You're not fine at all!

273
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,200
Here. Clean your face
with this, if anything.

274
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,099
What? Do you need me to get you
water in a basin, too, or something?

275
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,000
Wow, you're totally a genius!

276
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,500
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

277
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,399
Sheesh.

278
00:23:17,399 --> 00:23:19,800
Hey, why are you taking
someone else's phone--

279
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,800
Change the pattern for the
lock on your phone! Sheesh.

280
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,599
What are you doing?

281
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:32,200
Oh, I'll download some
fun games for you to play.

282
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,800
You'll probably get bored
being cooped up in here.

283
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,099
Wow, really?

284
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,000
There's a ton of games that
I play when I'm in my dressing room.

285
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,800
These are the best things
to play to kill some time.

286
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,899
Thanks, friend!

287
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,099
At his current place on the waitlist...

288
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,800
he'll have to wait two to
three years, at the very least.

289
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,000
However, if a relative
is willing to be a live donor

290
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
he can get pushed up the waitlist.

291
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,899
The Chairman told me to keep this
a secret from his family, at all costs.

292
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,300
Yes, of course.
I know that.

293
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,500
The person in need of the
donation is being stubborn
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

294
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,300
but there aren't enough donors.

295
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,399
Those who care about him
must be quite worried.

296
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,000
But, he refuses to let his condition
be known to his family members?

297
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes. That's how things stand now.

298
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,399
If the donor is his relative,
he can be operated on first

299
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:52,300
regardless of his place on the waitlist.

300
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,099
Excuse me?

301
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:57,500
There are currently over 200 brain-dead
patients who are potential donors.

302
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,599
However, there are thousands more
on the transplant waitlist.

303
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:07,200
However, if the recipient
is related to the donor

304
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,300
then that patient gets moved up
to the top of the list.

305
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,200
This also applies to people
who are only relatives on paper.

306
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,599
But of course, fabricating such
documents will cost you a bit.

307
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,099
It's not something that
I can do myself, you see.

308
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:26,700
Isn't saving a person's life
the most important thing right now?

309
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>[Manager]</i>

310
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,899
<i>[Manager]</i>

311
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:54,599
I told you that I'm
taking the day off today!

312
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,399
<i>Hey, where are you right now?</i>

313
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:04,399
Man, staying in my room this whole time
sure makes me feel cramped!

314
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,899
Just where did this guy go, though?

315
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,000
Why are you peeking
into someone else's room?

316
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,200
I'm... I'm not peeking!

317
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,899
Hey.

318
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:30,500
What?

319
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,800
Um... about what happened last night...

320
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,899
It was the first time, for me.

321
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,300
Huh?

322
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,399
It was the first time
that I got drunk...

323
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,700
and blacked out.

324
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,899
O-oh.

325
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:00,800
- What about you?
- Me?

326
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,599
Well, I... I...

327
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:11,899
Well, you know, I even got a concussion!
So I forgot pretty much everything!

328
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
Sure.

329
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,599
Control your alcohol intake from now on!

330
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,800
Oh, come on!

331
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm sorry for making you spend
so much time at the hospital

332
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,099
when such a life doesn't
suit a lady like yourself.

333
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,000
If there's anything you want
to buy, just say the word.

334
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,399
Do you think that I stayed with you
just so I could get to shop?

335
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,200
Buy some things for yourself, instead!
I don't need anything.

336
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,800
Do you want to make me buy you
all the clothes that this store sells?

337
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,500
That's what I'll be forced to do
if you don't pick something out yourself!

338
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,300
Oh, darling!
You're so silly!

339
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,800
Right? Can't stop, won't stop.

340
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,000
Wow, that's pretty.
Let's take a look at that.

341
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,800
Are you looking for a gift for someone?

342
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,800
Yes. I want to get them a valuable gift.

343
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,200
Refined gentlemen like
styles like these ones here.

344
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,399
No, these are too boring!

345
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,099
How old is the person
you want to give this to?

346
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,500
He's young enough that he could
wear something more flashy.

347
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,599
Oh, I see. Then...

348
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:49,200
How about this, ma'am?

349
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,899
I like it.

350
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,500
Of course.
I'm quite young.

351
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,000
At heart.

352
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,800
Look at her, buying a present for me when
I told her to get herself something.

353
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,000
What is it?

354
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,300
See for yourself.

355
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,200
What is all this?

356
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,099
I got a call from the paparazzi.

357
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,599
They're going to release these photos,
saying you got yourself a girlfriend.

358
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,200
What kind of nonsense is this?
That's not true!

359
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,800
Right? It's not true, right?

360
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,099
You two don't have
anything going on, right?

361
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,300
Well, we can't do anything about
the fact that these photos exist.

362
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,099
So if they do release these, let's just
deny that you have a girlfriend. Okay?

363
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,500
They said they're planning
to release these early tomorrow.

364
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,200
No. These definitely can't get out!

365
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,800
I'm sure we'll be getting tons of calls.
Things will be hard for a while.

366
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,200
But I'm sure this won't
hurt you in any way.

367
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,800
I mean, it's not like there was a photo
of you kissing her, or anything.

368
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,952
All you have to do is say,
"we're not dating!"

369
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,599
I told you, no!

370
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Haven't you given any consideration to
how Eun Ha Won will be affected?

371
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,300
Last time, she suffered because of
that issue between her and Hyun Min!

372
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,399
How do you think she'd feel if she had
to go through something like this again?

373
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,500
Hey, why are you acting like this,
all of a sudden?

374
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,200
- Find another way.
- Another... way?

375
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,800
Hey, these guys are totally relentless!
You know that, don't you?

376
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,200
You know that they go crazy
when something juicy pops up!

377
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,899
Really? Then give them something
even crazier to report on.

378
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:52,399
And where in the world would we get that?

379
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,599
You don't mean "that," do you?

380
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,800
Yeah. I have something that's
even juicier than those photos.

381
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,300
Don't let your imagination run wild.
It's nothing like that, okay?

382
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,000
My heart totally
skipped a beat just now.

383
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,200
When did my Seo Woo grow up so much?

384
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,700
Come on, snap back to reality!

385
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,500
What the heck? He can't even
remember what happened?

386
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,599
Did he really only do that
because he was under the influence?

387
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:37,200
That's not fair!

388
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Or, maybe I'm wrong.

389
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,599
Is it actually better that
he forgot about everything?

390
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,700
But still, this isn't right!

391
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,099
Damn him.
Should I go yell at him?

392
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,200
Oh, but even if I do, he won't
be able to remember anything!

393
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,599
Oh, forget it!

394
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,099
What are you doing?

395
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:03,200
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Ta-da!

397
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:11,200
Hey, why did you buy so much?

398
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,800
You feel totally thankful, right?

399
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,899
I even cut them for you, like this

400
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,800
so that you'll be able to wear
everything comfortably! See?

401
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,700
Hey! Why did you cut up
new clothes like that?

402
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,099
It's fine! They said that
they'd re-stitch them for me!

403
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,009
What does it matter if you cut it there?

404
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm sure that my thighs
won't even fit into those!

405
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,700
Don't worry. I knew
you'd say that, and...

406
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,099
You see this? I even bought you a dress.

407
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,599
At any rate, I'll fill up your closet
for you, so wear these clothes.

408
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,599
Got it?

409
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Geez, you...

410
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,800
What? Want me to put
these clothes on you, too?

411
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,399
- Sure, if you want--
- Wait!

412
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,000
That's enough.

413
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,599
- Thanks.
- Okay.

414
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,500
- Thanks!
- Sure!

415
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,800
Chairman.

416
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,099
What is it? Are you worried
that I'm worried about "that?"

417
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:13,000
Excuse me?

418
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,099
It's written all over your face.

419
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:17,800
Shall I... give them a call?

420
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,700
No, the opposite of that.

421
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,399
I don't even know how many
years this body has left

422
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,200
so I don't want to act like a coward
and cut the line, just to save my skin.

423
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,300
- But this might be the last option--
- I know how you must feel.

424
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,099
But there are some lines
that you just can't cut, in life.

425
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:44,200
There are things that no
amount of money can buy

426
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,399
and there are things that
one must never buy, too.

427
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:51,800
What, do you pity me that much?

428
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,499
No, sir.

429
00:33:55,499 --> 00:34:00,399
I was just thinking to myself
about what a great man I serve.

430
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,300
You've worked quite hard.

431
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,300
You must be, to notice something
as insignificant as that.

432
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,600
<i>About what happened last night...</i>

433
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,300
Oh, that? Let's just pretend
that it never happened.

434
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,300
What?

435
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,499
It's simple. Let's just pretend
that none of that happened.

436
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:40,800
Okay?

437
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,300
What's wrong with me?

438
00:35:11,499 --> 00:35:13,800
Oh, geez!

439
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,499
He's supposed to be a man, but he
blacked out from just a couple drinks?

440
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,700
How could you not remember what you did?

441
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,999
Geez!
Geez!

442
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,499
Oh no!

443
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,200
Wait a minute.
Why should I have to hide?

444
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,399
What is all this?

445
00:36:18,499 --> 00:36:21,600
Hey, Ms. Celebrity!
Eun Ha Won!

446
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,200
Can you open the door for me?

447
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,300
Hey, what are you doing here?

448
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,100
- Shush!
- What?

449
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,600
Can you help me up? Quick!

450
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,800
What are you doing here?
Did you get hurt badly?

451
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,499
- Quick! Get in!
- What? Why?

452
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,499
- Hurry up!
- Why?

453
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:42,200
- Geez.
- The door! Close the door!

454
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
What, the door?
You want it closed?

455
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,499
Geez. Why did you go out,
when your foot is still hurt?

456
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,700
Are you okay?

457
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
Yeah.

458
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,100
Sheesh. Wait just a sec.

459
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:26,300
Hey, why am I your girlfriend?
Our engagement wasn't even real!

460
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,700
You're just my employer.

461
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,899
Why are you being
so nice to her, Seo Woo?

462
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,999
Oh, geez.

463
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:52,300
Give me your hand.

464
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

465
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,937
What were you doing outside?

466
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh... I was just getting some fresh air.

467
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,999
- Oh, thanks.
- Geez.

468
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,499
What the hell is he doing?

469
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,700
Here, keep this wrapped
around your hands.

470
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:28,600
But, where did you go,
dressed like that?

471
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,399
- What's wrong with this outfit?
- What is this?

472
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:33,399
It's this new thing called
"curtain style!"

473
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,899
What even is that?

474
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:58,100
<i>[Banana milk]</i>

475
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,999
Wow, what kind of stain is this?
It just won't come out!

476
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,100
Um, about that shirt...
please just give it to me.

477
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Oh, Young Master! It hasn't been
properly washed yet, though.

478
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,499
I'll be sure
to wash it properly this time.

479
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:37,100
No, I'll just take this.

480
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,399
No, no. Washing your clothes
is one of my duties.

481
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:43,300
You can just give this back to me.

482
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,100
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden, Young Master?

483
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,800
This is a part of my duties!

484
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,999
- I told you, it's really fine!
- Oh my!

485
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:53,200
Oh my! Are you all right, Young Master?

486
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Are you hurt?

487
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,100
A man's hips are the most
important part of a man's body!

488
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
- Ow!
- Oh no!

489
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm fine.

490
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:04,200
Um, Young Master. It's nice to see
you around more often these days.

491
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,100
And you seem to be smiling
a lot more these days, too.

492
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,100
- I do?
- Yes.

493
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,899
Oh, really?

494
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,300
Here, have this.

495
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,399
Is he giving this to me
so that I get younger?

496
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:53,800
What the heck...

497
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Why did I take this, though?

498
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,300
It's not like I want evidence
of what happened, or anything.

00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,399
- A midnight snack?
- Hurry and sit.

00:41:57,399 --> 00:42:00,399
Wow, I really wanted to
eat this kind of stuff!

00:42:00,399 --> 00:42:02,499
You're the best!

00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:06,899
Wow, seasoned fried chicken?
It looks so delicious!

00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,800
Hey, how did you know that
this stuff is the good stuff?

508
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,499
Wow, this looks delicious!

509
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,899
You're totally touched, right?

See, this is why chicks
are crazy for me.

511
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,399
What, did another girl confess
her feelings to you lately?

512
00:42:24,399 --> 00:42:26,499
As if you need to reaffirm that fact!

513
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,499
You're not that popular lately, though.

514
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,899
Hey, what are you talking about?

515
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,800
Does anyone really like you
for who you are?

516
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Like Hye Ji does?

517
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
Well, duh.

518
00:42:44,399 --> 00:42:47,999
Hey! You're being really mean, you know.

519
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:52,600
- What now?
- You know Hye Ji really likes you.

520
00:42:54,899 --> 00:42:59,999
I think that Hye Ji
is really quite brave.

521
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:04,300
She's honest about her feelings,
and tries her best to be loved.

522
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,999
Do you know how hard that is to do?

523
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,999
She's like a tree.

524
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,800
She's planted her roots to one spot

525
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
and won't be shaken,
no matter what comes her way.

526
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,899
What about me, then?

527
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:21,600
You're...

528
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,499
like the wind, that just keeps blowing,
completely unaware of her efforts.

529
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:29,800
In other words, you're a real player!

530
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,399
Geez.

531
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,100
I wonder if I could ever bring
myself to do what she's doing.

532
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,700
Do you think you could,
if you were in her shoes?

533
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,800
I never had a chance to date because
I was too busy with part-time jobs

534
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,999
so I really know nothing
about how that must feel

535
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:54,100
but even I could tell whether or
not her feelings for you are real.

536
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,999
Hye Ji really has
earnest feelings for you.

537
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:07,499
Stop eating.
It doesn't suit you.

538
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:12,499
But I feel like you're that
way sometimes, too.

539
00:44:12,499 --> 00:44:13,899
What do you mean?

540
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,200
I'm talking about the way
you look at Hye Ji!

541
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,499
You're so rude to her
when you talk to her

542
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:25,200
but sometimes,
you look at her quite tenderly.

543
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,999
I'm not that complicated, you know.

544
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,100
But keep this in mind.

545
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,999
There's no tree that will wait
around for you forever.

546
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:40,999
Don't regret this later.

547
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:46,200
Eat up.

548
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,399
Hey!

549
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,300
I'm visiting someone who's sick, so
please don't make it too over-the-top.

550
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,100
Yes, I understand.

551
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:57,300
Here.

552
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,600
Happy?

553
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,111
<i>[Kang Seo Woo Flees While Wearing
Jungsan Girls' High Uniform!]</i>

554
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,999
I must be a genius, Manager.

555
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:11,100
Whatever. Let's not talk
about this anymore.

556
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,399
Come on, check out these comments!

557
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,499
"Kang Seo Woo looks cool,
no matter what he does!"

558
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:18,200
"He's so adorable!"

559
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,300
"Shield your eyes, my body!"

560
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:22,399
See? Everyone's going crazy over these.

561
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:23,899
Wait, really?

562
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:29,300
See? I told you!
I'm successful no matter what I do.

563
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,800
My Seo Woo... you're all
grown up now, aren't you?

564
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,200
You're all grown up!

565
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:38,600
Maybe I should've just said
that we're dating.

566
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
You're outside?

567
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,600
Huh? What brings you here?

568
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:57,300
I came by because I was
wondering how you were doing.

569
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,499
Oh... thanks!

570
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:02,700
I'm not that badly hurt, though.

571
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,499
I felt like you'd pretty much
have access to anything here

572
00:48:05,499 --> 00:48:08,100
so I brought you a bouquet of flowers.

573
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,100
Wow! Thanks!

574
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,499
Wow, they're so pretty!

575
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,700
Oh, do you want to come in for a second?

576
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,999
Sure.

577
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:27,100
Thanks.

578
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,899
It's this way.

579
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:41,100
So this is your room?

580
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,499
Oh, it's not my room, per se.

581
00:48:44,499 --> 00:48:48,499
It's really nice. Looks like the
Chairman put a lot of work into it!

582
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:51,100
Well, you know.

583
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,999
Thank you, Ms. Beolgyo!
I should've gotten this myself!

584
00:48:58,999 --> 00:49:02,200
What are you saying, with that leg?

585
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,899
Don't such say such things.

586
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:08,200
I'll come and clean this up
after you're finished.

587
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,499
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

588
00:49:18,399 --> 00:49:22,100
- Then, have a pleasant time conversing.
- We will!

589
00:49:23,499 --> 00:49:24,999
Eat up, Hye Ji!

590
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:25,999
Oh, okay.

591
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:30,600
Looks like everyone here likes you.

592
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,800
Me?

593
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,399
Well, you know.

594
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:37,800
Sometimes, I'm a bit jealous of you.

595
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,999
You get along so well
with all of the Kang Cousins.

596
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:43,399
Oh, it only seems like that
on the surface!

597
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:45,100
Everyone here actually fights a lot!

598
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,399
Sorry.

599
00:49:50,399 --> 00:49:54,100
My head itches because I couldn't
wash my hair for a couple of days.

600
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,800
Want me to help you?

601
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,399
Oh, it's okay! I hurt my ankle
and not my wrist, after all.

602
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,999
Okay, then. Go ahead.

603
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:07,100
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

604
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:54,999
Are you sleeping?

605
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,999
What are you doing?

606
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,399
Get out.

607
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,100
We need to talk.

608
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,700
I have nothing to say to you.

609
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,600
I can't pretend that nothing
happened between us.

610
00:51:57,399 --> 00:51:58,999
Don't be like this.

611
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:00,899
What am I to you?

612
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,100
A friend?

613
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,399
Or... the younger sister of my brother,
your friend that died?

614
00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:15,100
We don't have any kind of relationship.

615
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,999
And does this also mean nothing to you?

616
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:26,499
If you keep acting this way...

617
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:29,700
I really won't ever see you again.

618
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:40,399
You're not leaving?

619
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:46,499
I'll... leave, then.

620
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,700
Who's there?
Can you help me?

621
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,399
Oh man!

622
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,100
Hey. What are you doing down there?

623
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,300
What happened?

624
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,499
Well, uh...

625
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:09,700
I was trying to wash my hair, and...

626
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:15,499
Sorry, but can you call
Ms. Beolgyo for me?

627
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,499
She... went out before.

628
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:20,200
Oh... really?

629
00:54:21,399 --> 00:54:26,999
Then... I'm really sorry, but...

630
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:28,700
But can you help me up?

631
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,800
Sorry.

632
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,999
Geez.

633
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:35,600
Wait just a sec.

634
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,899
Geez, way to go.
Stay still.

635
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:44,899
Okay.

636
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:52,899
Thanks!

637
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,999
Um, thanks.

638
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,100
- Hey. You...
- What?

639
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,300
Are you planning to leave the bathroom
with your hair looking like that?

640
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,999
Oh.

641
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:23,999
Wow... no other guy but me
would do this for you!

642
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:26,899
Thanks.

643
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,100
Hey! You're getting water in my eyes!

644
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,100
Ugh!

645
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,300
All right, already!

646
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,499
Ah, my ear! Oh no!
There's water in my ear!

647
00:55:40,499 --> 00:55:43,399
Geez, stop protesting so much!

648
00:55:45,399 --> 00:55:48,200
Hey, what are you doing?

649
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,700
You have to dry it like this for it
to dry well. Just stay still, okay?

650
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,800
I knew you'd do this!
No! I'll do it! It's fine!

651
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,600
Oh, no, ma'am! You've hurt
your leg! Please, sit still.

652
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,700
I told you, it's fine!
I'll do it! I'll...

653
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,499
I told you, I'll do it myself!
Sheesh.

654
00:56:13,999 --> 00:56:17,100
Geez, you even complain
when I try to help you.

655
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,600
The dryer's in the bathroom.

656
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,999
Oh... thanks!

657
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,300
Wait a sec.

658
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:10,399
<i>If you keep acting like this...</i>

659
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:13,700
<i>I won't see you ever again.</i>

660
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:43,999
Hye Ji!

661
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:55,600
What's wrong, Hye Ji?

662
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,399
I told you not to make
Hye Ji cry, didn't I?

663
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,999
Who do you think you are?
What gives you that right?

664
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,100
Ji Woon has the right to say that.

665
00:59:34,899 --> 00:59:36,899
I...

666
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,600
don't want to cry
because of Hyun Min anymore.

667
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,800
I...

668
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,899
want to take a break from you.

669
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,999
Will you...

670
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,700
accept me?

671
01:00:31,694 --> 01:00:34,694
