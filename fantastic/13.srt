<i>[EPISODE 13]</i>

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,320
It's nice!

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,920
Your company name is Hyesung?

5
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,140
Combining So Hye and Hae Sung,
it's Hyesung Entertainment.

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,230
A big star that appears like a comet,
Hyesung Entertainment!

7
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,520
I like it.

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,750
This President and Director
of the company are busy filming

9
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,970
so the office is mostly empty.

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,350
So Writer Lee
can make herself comfortable

11
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,730
and use it as her work space.

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,900
Of course. Only a space of this caliber
will help me write.

13
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,230
How did you remember
all the details here?

14
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,140
Writer Sang Hwa advised us, of course.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,440
I see, I knew it.

16
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,960
Once Hitman is done, I plan to have
a company field trip to Uyuni.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,370
Really?

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,810
I should work hard!

19
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,610
Do you know the first thing I have to do
as the president of this company?

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,990
Sign a contract with Writer Lee So Hye.

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,690
Write down any number you want!

22
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,920
What should I do?
I am a little expensive.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,590
Writer Lee,
please make a good deal for us.

24
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,480
It's the first business that
your future husband is running.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,510
You're right. I will take time
to think about this, President.

26
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,090
Hi, Bro.

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
So Hye is here.

28
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,420
Why are you asking me to come out
in secret? You can just come up here.

29
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,880
Okay.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,780
What amazing gift did you bring that you
asked this universal star to come down?

31
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,430
Bro, what's wrong?

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,080
My body doesn't listen to me.

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,180
I can't reach the backseat.
My bag, please.

34
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,310
Your bag...

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,240
- Shouldn't we call an ambulance now?
- No.

36
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,550
- The orange pills from the bag...
- The orange pills...

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,170
Get me just one pill.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,410
Here.

39
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,480
Bro.

40
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,500
Bro! Hong Joon Ki!
Hong Joon Ki!

41
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,710
Bro! Bro!

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,580
Why are you making a fuss?

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,830
- Seriously...
- Calm down and quietly...

44
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,500
Check the breathing and pulse.
Don't shake the patient.

45
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,620
That's what I taught you last time.

46
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,610
You get no points!

47
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,010
Are you really all right?

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,270
Yeah.

49
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm a good actor, aren't I?

50
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,930
I made you practice
for a real situation.

51
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,380
What kind of doctor acts better than me?

52
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,840
Shouldn't we call the hospital now
and ask for an ambulance?

53
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,820
Let's go to the hospital
quietly on our own.

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay.

55
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,750
Let's switch seats.

56
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,860
Careful! Watch out.

57
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,470
Careful.

58
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,880
Hold on. Hang in there.
We'll get there quickly.

59
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,260
This punk has finally reached my brain.

60
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,550
It's progressing quickly.
It was clean last time.

61
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,720
- Don't tell Jamie.
- Joon Ki, but...

62
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,240
Just for a few days.

63
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,810
I will tell her myself.

64
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,860
Okay.

65
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,340
Hi.

66
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,600
Where are you? You left suddenly
and didn't even call.

67
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,980
- Oh, I had an errand.
- What kind? Did you meet with someone?

68
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,210
It's...

69
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,870
Mr. Hae Sung, you're slacking off because
you don't want to organize, aren't you?

70
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,140
Yeah... Writer Sang Hwa is sharp!

71
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,300
Dr. Hong wanted to play
a game of pool with me.

72
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,330
What? A game of pool?

73
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,380
Yes, he lost last time, so he really
wanted to get back at me.

74
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,500
Yes, I'm sorry.

75
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,240
Stop organizing. Go home and rest now.

76
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,640
Yes, I will head home. Okay.

77
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,000
Hong Joon Ki!
Dr. Hong, wait for me!

78
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,800
Have a seat. Don't stand like that.

79
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,290
There is a way, right?

80
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,750
Surgery or something...
You'll get treatment, right?

81
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,990
When I was little, I had this music box
that I really liked.

82
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,290
Its song was three minutes long,
and when it was over

83
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,950
I kept rewinding it
to listen to it over and over.

84
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,770
Then it was broken.

85
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,680
I cried to have the spring replaced,
but it didn't make any sound.

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,830
The music box had already worn out.

87
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,360
I am that music box now.

88
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
It's no use,
even if I replace the spring now.

89
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,290
I stuck it out for five years.

90
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,700
I enjoyed everything without any regrets.

91
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,800
I don't want to hang on
with IV lines coming out of everywhere.

92
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,460
That's what I've been thinking.

93
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,440
A week, if that.

94
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,750
What should I do
while I can still walk on my own?

95
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,740
What should I do first?

96
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,810
Mr. Ryu Hae Sung! Let's not be sappy.

97
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,130
Do you like me that much?

98
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,350
Then will you make my wish come true?

99
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Let me borrow Writer Lee for three days.

100
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,240
So that I can have a passionate
relationship for the last time.

101
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:01,110
What's this? You were crying, but you're
not even granting my final wish.

102
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,200
That's...
What I mean is...

103
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,770
I'm joking.

104
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,760
Can you help me prepare for my funeral?
It's my final party.

105
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,010
Do you plan to do it yourself?

106
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,870
It's the last item on my bucket list.

107
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,740
I wanted to plan it with Writer Lee.

108
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,510
But I think you'll be better
for me to order around.

109
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,050
Let's do that.

110
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,720
You're back?

111
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,320
Who won?

112
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,600
What do you mean?

113
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,070
You said you played pool with Dr. Hong.

114
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,170
After a fierce fight, we were even.

115
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,410
You should've let him win.

116
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:08,940
Dr. Hong is a really warm person,
the more you get to know him.

117
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,680
Yes.

118
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,250
If I didn't have him,
I couldn't have lasted like this.

119
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,990
I am lucky to have my doctor!

120
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,420
- Were you working?
- Yes, it's going well.

121
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,630
By the way,
when will we have a wedding ceremony?

122
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,280
My friends were asking.

123
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,540
I think it'll be in a few weeks.

124
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,490
I ordered a suit from Italy

125
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,030
but it takes time
because it's made by an artisan.

126
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,670
Why did you order a suit from Italy?
We're having a small wedding.

127
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm the universal top star!

128
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,170
No matter how small it is,
I have a base scale to uphold.

129
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:56,920
Trust me.
I will show you how fashion can explode.

130
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,450
Seriously, you talk about
that explosion every day.

131
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,750
Did you tell Dr. Hong about our wedding?

132
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,190
Not yet.

133
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,050
Once it's set, I'll tell him then.

134
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,440
Okay.

135
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:20,440
Why does my universal top star
look so down?

136
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,830
I spent all my energy playing pool.

137
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,050
My Princess shouldn't work too hard.

138
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,690
Let's go rest.

139
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,950
I will write just a little more.
It's fun. You should go rest.

140
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,670
I understand, Writer Lee.

141
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,020
I will let you in on the best medication

142
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,580
not just for patients,
but also for guardians.

143
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,790
You don't need a doctor or a pharmacist.
You can do this on your own.

144
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,910
On top of that, it's free!

145
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,880
Everyone, open your mouth wide
and take a deep breath.

146
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,280
This is the natural health booster,
oxygen.

147
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,640
Don't worry about others,
just take in as much as you want!

148
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,620
When we're stressed out,
we take short breaths.

149
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,090
With short breaths, we don't
get enough necessary oxygen.

150
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,090
And the toxins don't leave the body.

151
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,240
That's when cancer cells
come straight up.

152
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,840
Now, one more time!

153
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,380
Slowly, take a deep breath!

154
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,370
Make your money quickly,
make your money quickly...

155
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,970
By the way,
Ms. Pyo Mi Sook is missing today.

156
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,960
She went for prayers.
She wanted to try again.

157
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,810
My goodness.

158
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,580
You should not fast.

159
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,200
You have to eat a lot of good things

160
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,900
so that the good cells
can fight against cancer cells.

161
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,710
If you want to pray,
go to the early morning prayer.

162
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,370
Go after you have good breakfast.

163
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,030
It will also be an exercise.
Isn't it nice?

164
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,310
Do you know this story?
A devout person prayed to God.

165
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,480
"My lord, I believe only in you."

166
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,310
"Please spare me.
Please cure me from cancer."

167
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,460
But, unfortunately he died
and went to Heaven.

168
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,440
And he asked God, "Why did you not
listen to my prayer?"

169
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,930
What do you think God said to him?

170
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,910
Do you know this story?
A devout person prayed to God.

171
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,970
"My lord, I believe only in you."

172
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,070
"Please spare me.
Please cure me from cancer."

173
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,670
But, unfortunately he died
and went to Heaven.

174
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,880
And he asked God, "Why did you not
listen to my prayer?"

175
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,500
What do you think God said to him?

176
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,930
"That's why I sent you a good doctor."

177
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,460
"Why? Did you not listen to the doctor?"

178
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:32,730
Please, you have to keep
listening to your doctor.

179
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,190
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

180
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,050
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

181
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,150
You haven't exercised recently,
have you?

182
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,810
I've been busy recently.

183
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,060
It was also a big shock
to have the delirium.

184
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,980
If you don't exercise because you're busy

185
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,900
your body will deteriorate
before you know it.

186
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,700
Make sure to walk twice a day,
30 minutes at a time.

187
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,620
Tell me if it's too much for you.
I'll prescribe oxygen for you.

188
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,060
Yes.

189
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,460
Let's walk together with Seol.
You must be bored to walk alone.

190
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,870
No, I go for walks
with Dr. Hong once in a while.

191
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,210
Should we start the walks again?

192
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,520
I think it's better for you
to walk with your friends.

193
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,090
I'm busy with school work.

194
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,090
Are you eating well,
following the regimen?

195
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,210
Yes, I am trying.

196
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,910
What's the use of trying?

197
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,130
The listed amount here
is the necessary amount.

198
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,730
You have to eat this at least
in order to hold the medication.

199
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,480
Is it hard for you to digest food?
Then tell me.

200
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,240
I'll prescribe digestive medication.

201
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,630
Is there something going on, Dr. Hong?

202
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,300
You're really scary.

203
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,290
It's because a bad patient
doesn't listen to me.

204
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,340
I'll become really busy
with school work now.

205
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,070
So I can't check on every little item.

206
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,670
I got it!

207
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,540
We'll keep her disciplined by her side!

208
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes. Please take good care
of this bad patient.

209
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,870
Dr. Hong, do you have any plans?

210
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,670
Should we have lunch together?

211
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,200
I have school work.
Let's take a rain check.

212
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,500
Sure. We'll get going then.

213
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,140
Let's go.

214
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,950
Dr. Hong is a bit odd today.
Is there something going on?

215
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:08,050
Was he? He seemed to be really kind.

216
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,200
- He has a killer smile.
- Right? He is a great person.

217
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,400
Thinking about it, he couldn't have
been in good condition all the time.

218
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,470
But he's always smiling.

219
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,320
I always whined and moaned.
I've always received a lot from him.

220
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,380
You must feel really secure
to have a doctor like him.

221
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,890
- You should give him a small gift.
- Should I?

222
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,790
- What would be a good gift?
- Does he like anything particular?

223
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,250
It's really true that I've only
received from him.

224
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,400
I've only given answers to, "What would
you like?" and "What do you want to eat?"

225
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,530
But I've never asked him even once.

226
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,630
That's because he's the doctor
and you're the patient.

227
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,580
We call each other a dozen times a day.

228
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,680
But I didn't even know
Dr. Hong's birthday.

229
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,120
I am a really bad patient.
I should write a letter of apology.

230
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,480
Should I bake a cake?

231
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,530
Why would you make it hard for you and
bake it? Just buy one for him.

232
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,220
The ones that are sold
are not good for patients.

233
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,040
I should make one with rye
that's good for health.

234
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,360
Let's go buy the ingredients!
It'll also be my exercise!

235
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,180
Sounds good!

236
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,040
Yo, Bro!

237
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,100
This universal top star emptied out
his schedule until the evening.

238
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,630
How are you doing?

239
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm not making a big deal.

240
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,450
Okay, got it.

241
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,470
What's this smell, by the way?

242
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,470
Ouch!

243
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,870
Wait, So Hye! So Hye!

244
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,940
What's this?

245
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:44,870
I'm baking a cake, but the temperature
is not quite right because it's rye.

246
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,010
Cake...

247
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,390
- Were you baking a cake again?
- Yes.

248
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:58,060
But this is for Dr. Hong.

249
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,050
Dr. Hong?

250
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:05,150
Don't be jealous!
It's a gift from a patient to a doctor.

251
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,250
- But...
- Okay, I got it!

252
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,120
I will also make one for you.

253
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,580
Excuse me, it's okay, Writer Lee.

254
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,770
Hae Sung needs to go on a diet.

255
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,830
This is fine because I make a healthy
cake with rye and no sugar.

256
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,440
You don't add any sugar?

257
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,200
Let's please add something in there.

258
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,820
It's okay to add lots of sugar.

259
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,730
But this one is a failure, right?

260
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,810
- Here, perilla seed oil.
- Perilla seed oil! It's so nutty.

261
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,140
- Are they still together?
- They are not.

262
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,670
Where is this punk now?

263
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,210
It's really yummy.

264
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,630
- What is your name...
- Older sister.

265
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,610
- But it's still some connection...
- You are a little brother.

266
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,910
Let's just be brother and sister.

<i>What's your blood type?</i>

269
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,480
Type O.

270
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,710
I have A blood type.

271
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,710
And?

272
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,910
Type A and Type O make the best match...

273
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,140
Don't think about useless things
and study hard!

274
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,770
I'm not a student!

275
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,280
Then make a pretty girlfriend
and go on fun dates.

276
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,480
I left it there!

277
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,840
Sister, did you sleep well?

278
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,570
I didn't know your size...

279
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,260
I will be waiting at the cafe
in front of the hotel.

280
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,170
Hey! What's going on?

281
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,960
Why did Jin Tae
drink so much last night?

282
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,140
He must be really upset these days.

283
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,150
He still went to work on time.

284
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,620
Where is this wench
and what is she doing?

285
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,990
Her mom's at a nursing home.
She moved her to a really nice place.

286
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,170
With what money?

287
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,380
Has she had a secret stash
this whole time?

288
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,080
What's with that?

289
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,470
How can you possibly clean
with that thing?

290
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,680
This is a really rare, old wooden floor.

291
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,690
You should use a rag and polish it
with your hands!

292
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,860
You want me to polish this wide floor
with a rag?

293
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,430
Of course!

294
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:02,140
Did you think you'd take someone else's
money after doing such a hack job?

295
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,050
Who would clean this two-story, old
house with a rag for that money?

296
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,100
There is no dish washer
or rag cleaner in this big house!

297
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,380
I cannot bear the sight of this!

298
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,860
Why would you look for a dish washer
when you have two normal hands?

299
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,860
No wonder you live that way.
You're so lazy.

300
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
Then why you hire someone when you
have two healthy hands yourself?

301
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,090
Look, how can you
talk back at her every time?

302
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,280
Why do you speak to me so rudely?
I'm older than you!

303
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,190
And what?
You can't bear the sight of this?

304
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,720
You're making no sense at all.

305
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,430
Oh my!

306
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,060
That, that...

307
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,810
Where did you find that lowly woman?

308
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,590
Mom, enough is enough! They don't want
to come work at our house!

309
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,980
Seriously.

310
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,230
Whether you have
to give her money or candy...

311
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,980
bring your sister-in-law right now.

312
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,040
She broke all those expensive wines
and crawled out of here.

313
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,310
How can she possibly
stay out so comfortably?

314
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,150
She paid for a year in advance
for the nursing home?

315
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,410
Yes.

316
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,900
Who did? Did Ms. Baek Seol pay herself?

317
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,540
I cannot tell you that much detail.
Are you her family?

318
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,400
Of course.

319
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,560
Ms. Baek Seol is right over there.

320
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,310
Why would you come? I'm on my way out.

321
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,630
Have you been well?

322
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,570
I'll call you back.

323
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,010
I didn't know you had
this kind of audacity.

324
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,010
You know the value of the wines
you broke that day, right?

325
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,090
Mom says she'll forgive you because
you're still her daughter-in-law.

326
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,580
Come back.

327
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,560
They say that the love from hate
is stronger.

328
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,830
The spot you left feels too big.

329
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,840
This is for surgery. I saw that you also
paid for the nursing home in advance.

330
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,730
I don't know what kind of money you used,
but pay it back with this.

331
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,730
I don't need it.

332
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you think I'm doing this because
I'm scared of that ledger book?

333
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,330
That's nothing.

334
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,400
Will you take it to the Prosecutor's
Office? Go ahead then.

335
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,430
You'll be the odd one.

336
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,370
Let's just say that what's written
in the ledger is true.

337
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,980
Unless you're an idiot, who would still
keep the items in the ledger?

338
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,350
I made Jin Tae end things with her.

339
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,510
It won't happen again.

340
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,820
It doesn't matter. I told you that day
that I'd get a divorce.

341
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,540
Who'd decide that?

342
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,800
I don't have any more to hear or to say.

343
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,650
Sit down!

344
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,940
Did you have fun with Kim Sang Wook?

345
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,430
You're pretty good
at seducing a younger man.

346
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,360
I thought something was weird that day.

347
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,480
Don't be ridiculous and come back
while I'm being nice to you.

348
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,870
I've never done anything that
goes against my conscience.

349
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,670
You should leave
while I'm still being nice to you.

350
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,080
Secretary Yang.

351
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,320
- Come with us, ma'am.
- Let go of me! Let go!

352
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,030
- Let go!
- That's Seol!

353
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,340
Hey! Hey, Hey!

354
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,650
Lady, are you a gangster?

355
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,580
Why do you force someone
when she doesn't want to go with you?

356
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,030
What's this?

357
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:49,160
CEO Choi, we meet again here.

358
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,670
Writer Lee...

359
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,480
What kind of picture is this?

360
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,230
We're best friends from high school.

361
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,340
So this was your scenario, Writer Lee.

362
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,620
I knew it...

363
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,310
My sister-in-law is not capable
of starting something like this.

364
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,310
What do you mean, something like this?

365
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,830
What are you talking about?

366
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,730
Stay out of this.

367
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,190
I believe you're not in the condition
to meddle in someone else's business.

368
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,420
You could get hurt really badly.

369
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,200
You're the one to stay out of this.

370
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,840
It won't even take one punch
to take you out.

371
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,480
Who do you think you're threatening?

372
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,490
Step aside! How dare you block my way!

373
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:37,370
I'm glad I got you today!
I'll pull out all of your hair!

374
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,260
Wait! Wait, Mi Sun!
Stop! Stop!

375
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,660
Don't bother my friends.

376
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:50,150
I'm going to pull out all of it
next time!

377
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,370
Really, that wench!

378
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,580
Please calm down. Let's go.

379
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,410
How dare she!

380
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:05,470
What could've happened
if we weren't around?

381
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,050
We can't stay like this.
Let's look for a lawyer first.

382
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,260
I'll look into it.

383
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,990
Thank you.

384
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,080
So, all legal issues regarding HyeSung
Entertainment have been resolved, right?

385
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,280
Yes. The contract with the broadcasting
company has also been signed.

386
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,030
Oh, check this last part please.

387
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,010
I was looking at this part just now.

388
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,190
I feel really secure to have Sang Wook.

389
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,300
You should've been there, Chang Seok.

390
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,950
In front of CEO Choi...

391
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,210
"It's not enough.
In that case, I will file a lawsuit!"

392
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,340
When he said that,
my indigestion of 10 years was gone!

393
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,830
Really? That's awesome.

394
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,080
This is like a great king
earning a flying horse.

395
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,610
You're too kind.

396
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:57,340
Then what about me?

397
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,030
Was I just a donkey?

398
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,410
Why are you getting upset?

399
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,610
You are...

400
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,210
An arrow of a great archer.

401
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,420
An arrow!

402
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,920
By any chance...
can you take care of a divorce case?

403
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,960
Yes, it's possible.

404
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,140
Oh, that's right!

405
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,620
We were looking for a divorce lawyer.

406
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,230
Are you the one...

407
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,310
Me?

408
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,790
I'm still single!

409
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,190
He doesn't look like he's married!

410
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,620
Here she comes!
Princess So Hye, you're home!

411
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,350
Say hello to our lawyer.

412
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:45,370
- Hello.
- Oh, you're Sang Hwa's friend.

413
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,910
Hello.

414
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,450
I think I've met you before.

415
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,830
I've heard a lot about you
from Sang Hwa.

416
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,550
I'm your fan, Writer Lee.

417
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,850
You are? Thank you.

418
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:02,860
Writer Lee, he says he can help
with Ms. Seol's divorce.

419
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,390
Oh, that works! We came together anyway.

420
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,920
Really?

421
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,170
Why are you carrying something so heavy?

422
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,700
You came!

423
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,970
Hello!

424
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,090
Sis!

425
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,190
What brings you here, Brother...

426
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,300
Do you know each other?

427
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,650
Who is he? He's really good looking.

428

429
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,590
So we meet again like this.

430
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,950
Were you preparing for a divorce?

431
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,040
You keep catching my embarrassing side.

432
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,130
Divorce is not an embarrassment!

433
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,110
I will help you.

434
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,320
It won't be easy to get a divorce
from the owner of JS Law Firm.

435
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,800
I was going to contact you anyway.

436
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,620
He is suspicious of you and me.

437
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:25,030
From this moment, just forget everything
that happened between you and me.

438
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:29,170
Don't call or text me.
Don't answer a call from him either.

439
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,090
I also have the responsibility
in that situation.

440
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,620
I can't do that.

441
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,600
That's why you can't!
Listen to me.

442
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,190
Just shake it off.

443
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:43,310
Even if he's the owner of JS Law Firm,
I should be able to get a lawyer.

444
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:47,970
I don't want to get you involved
in things like this.

445
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,060
Let's make sure
we don't run into each other.

446
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,560
Kim Sang Wook is the guy with the
motorcycle you mentioned before, right?

447
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,110
Yes. I will tell you the details
next time.

448
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,070
Since you're already here,
you should sleep over

449
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,030
and have a strategy meeting with So Hye.

450
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,600
I'm nervous that my mom's alone.
I should go.

451
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,610
Okay. Call me if anything happens.
I will look for another lawyer.

452
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,890
Okay. Get some rest. Bye.

453
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,690
Did you meet with her? What did she say?

454
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,360
We need to wrap this up quickly.
Some horrible girls are with her.

455
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,140
There is more, other than Kim Sang Wook?

456
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,060
Writer Lee So Hye!

457
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,920
She's not easy to deal with.

458
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,250
Before it becomes a bigger problem,
we need to sort this out.

459
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,730
- Don't worry. Who am I?
- Do you have a plan?

460
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:24,140
I do have a plan. Don't worry.

461
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,310
Hey, get in!

462
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,740
What? "Hey"?

463
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,660
Come here!

464
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,150
I'm getting in only because
the color of the car is blue.

465
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,490
Here.

466
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,320
Do I look okay?

467
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:03,870
But... doesn't he look like a priest?

468
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,140
- Here?
- Yes!

469
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,360
Isn't it nice, just like a priest?
It's noble.

470
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,200
- Yes, you need a tie or a bowtie.
- Put a butterfly or something.

471
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,800
Buy me this one! I like it!

472
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,810
Isn't it too ordinary?

473
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,980
With a bowtie!

474
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,910
- It's too dark.
- It is?

475
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,720
- A bright color.
- A bright color...

476
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,800
Pink!

477
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,300
You're doing this on purpose, right?

478
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,920
This is really...
Yes, the color matching!

479
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,640
- Isn't this pretty?
- It is pretty!

480
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,940
- Put this on.
- I wanted to try this.

481
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,660
It's nice!

482
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,220
- No socks... Take off your socks!
- My socks?

483
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,280
This is not important.

484
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,170
You look great!

485
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,470
Please give them to me.

486
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,990
- Didn't we buy too much?
- Chang Seok likes carrying things.

487
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,330
I like it.

488
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,110
You look great. Great!

489
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,950
You!

490
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,510
Socks!

491
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,170
- Isn't it too much?
- Don't worry.

492
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,600
Now... if we can't find it here, we have
to consider that it doesn't exist.

493
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,970
I have to have it.

494
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,300
You should look in the next section.

495
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,490
How can you say it's not here
after searching for a bit there?

496
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,550
This one is pretty!

497
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,220
Two lovebirds.

498
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,170
What would you like written in there?

499
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,840
Here it is.

500
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,850
<i>2016. I'd like to invite you to
Hong Joon Ki's adieu party.</i>

501
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,840
It looks like we've covered
just about everything.

502
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,960
Do you have anywhere else
you want to go?

503
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,870
<i>[WATCH A MOVIE WITH THE ONE I LOVE
WHILE EATING POPCORN FOR A COUPLE.]</i>

504
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:23,560
I saw paragliding and skydiving in
movies. Do you want to try those?

505
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,000
I've already done them.

506
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,200
I completed the last item
on my bucket list.

507
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,330
To prepare for my final party,
the funeral.

508
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,770
Dr. Hong! Where are you?

509
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>I'm at the hospital.
Why? Did something happen?</i>

510
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,910
No, I was just curious.

511
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,510
Then have a good day.

512
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,650
Did you come to see Dr. Hong?
He's off today.

513
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,500
He's off? Did he go to some conference?

514
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,430
Conference? No, there is no conference.

515
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,390
I see.

516
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,270
Hong Joon Ki! Dr. Hong!

517
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,560
Dr. Hong!

518
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,890
<i>The call cannot be connected, so you
will be transferred to voicemail...</i>

519
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,160
He said he was at the hospital.
Where did he go?

520
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>Dr. Hong, you said you were at the
hospital, but you're not around.</i>

521
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,100
<i>This is a healthy cake
that I baked myself. Enjoy!</i>

522
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,550
<i>From Lee So Hye, the good patient.</i>

523
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,460
I bought lots of clothes,
and I feel great!

524
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,530
You can go again next time and buy more.

525
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,370
So Hye was here.

526
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,220
A cake she baked herself!

527
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,280
Lee So Hye, really...

528
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,310
Wow, it looks delicious!

529
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,340
This must be me.

530
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,330
Bro, wait.

531
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,280
Don't eat this.

532
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,720
What? Are you jealous?

533
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,160
Since So Hye made this for me,
I will eat all of this by myself!

534
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,480
But she made an effort.

535
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,240
It's her effort, so here.

536
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,440
I don't know what she put in here...

537
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,470
But I'm sure the ingredients
must be the best quality.

538
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,060
Are you pretty much done
with your party preparation?

539
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,640
Just about.

540
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,200
It was a lot of fun today,
thanks to you.

541
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,770
I still have about two hours
before my filming starts.

542
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,350
Do you want to go anywhere else?

543
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,980
I want to go hang out
at the filming location.

544
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,410
At the filming location?

545
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:07,210
I'm curious about how
Writer Lee's script gets filmed.

546
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,240
Hello! Hello!

547
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,160
Hello!

548
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,710
This is what a filming studio looks like.
This is really nice!

549
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,580
Bro, since you came all the way here,
do you want to be an extra in the drama?

550
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,880
Why don't you stamp your face
on Writer Lee's drama?

551
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,310
You're dressed so nicely.
It's a waste if you don't.

552
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,470
Really? I do want to try it.

553
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,180
With a line to say, if possible.

554
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,570
Bro! Acting is not that easy.

555
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,360
Why do you think people still
refer to me as "foot acting"?

556
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,060
I have over 10 years
of acting experience.

557
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,250
I know I can do a good job.

558
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,470
Really?

559
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,730
Then you should read a line.

560
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,270
Chang Seok, remember that scene?

561
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,420
Your foot. Oh, yes!

562
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,670
- Your foot...
- It's not that bad.

563
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,110
Here it is! This part.

564
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,360
Here.

565
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,390
Choose one. Do you want to die?

566
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,470
Or do you want to kill me?

567
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,320
Awesome.

568
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,640
He's good.

569
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,900
Should we go straight to the studio?

570
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,820
What studio?

571
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,530
How can you be so sneaky
and attack my stomach?

572
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,360
What the heck is this?

573
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,480
I will protect here!

574
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,530
Receive the power of wind!

575
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

577
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,230
What's this?

578
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,990
You looked upset yesterday,
so I made one for you, too.

579
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,830
You liked it last time.

580
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,410
What are you doing?

581
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,640
My So Hye is so pretty!

582
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,280
I'm not interested in a cake like that!

583
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,150
Are you free tomorrow, So Hye?

584
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,630
Until we watch the first episode.

585
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,930
Yes. Why?

586
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:12,330
Let's go on a date.

587
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,330
Dress nicely...

588
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,560
Don't dress too nice.

589
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:24,950
Forget it.
Wear something really beautiful.

590
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,080
What are you doing?

591
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,610
- Wear something beautiful.
- Okay.

592
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,580
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

593
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:42,320
Mister, here.

594
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,410
You should wear socks!

595
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,140
Chang Seok!

596
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,780
What?

597
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,380
So I have to be there?

598
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,450
I have no choice. Okay.

599
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:07,930
I said, okay!

600
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:11,330
I have my filming scheduled
all of a sudden.

601
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,800
Really?

602
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,250
You two should watch the movie.
Buy groceries before you come home.

603
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,160
We have no choice. See you later.

604
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,210
Don't eat a meal together.
Juice is as far as you can go!

605
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,060
Bye.

606
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,610
You should wear socks!

607
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:46,740
Chang Seok, bring it over here.

608
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,870
This is a garden? It's awesome.

609
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,000
- Hurry! Be careful.
- Okay.

610
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,250
Here, this way.

611
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,050
It's nice. Nice.

612
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,870
Oh baby.

613
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,870
Slow...

614
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:51,250
Hey, then... the energy of death
that the tarot reader mentioned...

615
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,430
You're talking nonsense!

616
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:56,140
I was just...

617
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,810
I was quoting the song...

618
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,220
Really? Why?

619
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,610
- It doesn't make sense.
- Really.

620
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,000
What do you like, Dr. Hong?

621
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,030
I like ramen.

622
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,700
Dr. Hong, how do you like this one?

623
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,160
I like it.

624
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,970
Are you a good cook?

625
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,700
I'm not good at it, but I enjoy it.

626
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,280
What kind of pasta do you like?

627
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,520
I like oil-based pasta,
something a little spicy.

628
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:01,170
Okay, then... I should buy some
spicy peppers and jalapeno peppers.

629
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,660
They were over there.

630
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,100
Let's go.

631
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,810
I've really wanted to do this.

632
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:13,500
"What should we eat?"

633
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,130
"So this is in season these days."

634
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,080
To talk about mundane things, pick
groceries and make a meal together...

635
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:24,810
An ordinary everyday life.
I think that's real happiness.

636
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,280
I wanted a relationship with passionate
endorphins in my 20's.

637
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,640
But as I got older,
I like subtle love like serotonin.

638
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,560
You're right. I can't be in a passionate
relationship anymore because it's tiring.

639
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,290
You get all of your energy taken out.

640
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:43,030
<i>Only for the next 10 minutes, herring
in season is on sale for 30 percent!</i>

641
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,510
- Thirty percent?
- It's only for 10 minutes. Where is it?

642
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,370
- Let's hurry.
- Over there.

643
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Are you done with filming, Hae Sung?

644
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,530
You're not eating together, are you?
You're grocery shopping, right?

645
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,860
Hang up please. You're interrupting us.

646
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,730
Buy enough since you're there.

647
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:20,140
You said you have a lot of money.

648
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,500
<i>Fill up the cart with the most
expensive, best stuff.</i>

649
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,490
The timed sale is almost over.
I'm busy! Bye!

650
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,550
Come home quickly!

651
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,690
- He told us not to eat together.
- Really?

652
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,900
<i>Watch a movie with the one I love
while eating popcorn for a couple.</i>

653
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,640
<i>Shop for groceries until
the cart is completely full.</i>

654
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,130
<i>Feed the one I love and my friends
the food that I cook.</i>

655
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:57,690
- So Hye, have you ever been on a diet?
- No.

656
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,140
I've been on a me-me diet.

657
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,310
I think you should be on it too.

658
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,600
Why? Did I gain weight?

659
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,060
No, you're too skinny.

660
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,820
"Who wants to eat bread?"
"Me!"

661
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,390
"Who wants beef?"
"I do!"

662
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,910
"Who wants more rice?"
"Me, me!"

663
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,870
This is what the "me, me" diet is about.

664
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:22,440
It's a necessary diet
for cancer colleagues like us.

665
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:27,310
No matter what kind of situation it is,
we have to say, "me, me" and eat more!

666
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:32,050
That's how... we can live.

667
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,580
Yes.

668
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,170
The market is full of cold air.

669
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,200
So you have to wear a scarf
to come here.

670
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,280
Keep yourself warm at all times, okay?

671
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,960
I will. Thank you.

672
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,960
We should go buy eggplants.

673
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,550
Let's go buy eggplants now.

674
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,030
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

675
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,810
Why don't we go with an eggplant dish?

676
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,730
You're trying lots of things.

677
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,310
You can do everything.

678
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,320
Right?
I intimidate a lot of people, right?

679
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,620
What a nice picture!

680
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:32,430
- You're home!
- Did your filming go well?

681
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:36,720
For the 3 hours, 26 minutes, and
42 seconds since I called you last time

682
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,130
where have you been and
what have you been doing?

683
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,540
Tell me in 10 minute segments
according to the Five W's.

684
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,890
Has it been that long?

685
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,320
I know. I was having so much fun,
I didn't know time was passing.

686
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,760
My friends will be arriving soon.
What do we do?

687
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,350
We're almost done anyway.

688
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,420
Have a taste of this for me.

689
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,880
How is it?

690
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,780
It's good!
But for me, there is something...

691
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,780
I should add some salt.

692
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,060
But we shouldn't eat salty foods

693
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,350
so let's tell other people
to adjust their taste buds.

694
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:06,860
Yes, let's do that. I like it.

695
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,100
You two, seriously, what are you doing?

696
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,640
What eggplant dish? I've been watching
you talk about eggplants.

697
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,680
I'll show you what an eggplant dish
should be. Watch me.

698
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,260
- Be careful.
- You should just go.

699
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:24,980
- Hello!
- We're here!

700
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:27,830
- Writer Lee!
- Welcome!

701
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,920
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,500
Yes?

704
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,530
Sir, how did you find this place...

705
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,080
You must be surprised
that I came to see you all of a sudden.

706
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,360
Can you give me a cup of tea?

707
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,340
I didn't come here to get angry at you.

708
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,510
I came to talk with you.

709
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:30,830
This evidence has no legal grounds.

710
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,190
Other than the fact that a man
and a woman went into a hotel room

711
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:39,120
there is no way to prove
what they did in the room.

712
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:44,450
But things change if the woman is
the wife of the law firm owner

713
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:48,030
and the man is an employee
of that law firm.

714
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:52,280
A man went into a hotel room
with his boss' wife?

715
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,490
It is enough evidence to prove
damaged dignity as a lawyer

716
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,690
adultery, and immorality.

717
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,430
With this one photo,
your life as a lawyer is over.

718
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:07,190
Are you threatening me now?

719
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:08,730
No.

720
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,880
Despite all of it, I trust you.
That's what I'm telling you.

721
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,450
My wife? She's a good woman.

722
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,600
I also trust my wife.

723
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:28,320
So, please help me.

724
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,680
I...

725
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,560
I can't live without my wife!

726
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:41,470
Please convince her to meet with me.

727
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,260
She doesn't even answer my calls.

728
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:48,890
Please ask her to come out.
No, let's meet together.

729
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:51,720
The three of us should meet together
and resolve any misunderstanding.

730
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,580
There is one thing I want to check.

731
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:01,740
What about her bruise that night?

732
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,930
My mother hit her.

733
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,760
They don't get along at all.

734
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:16,750
My wife can't get pregnant,
so my mother is upset.

735
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:20,720
That's why I plan to move out.

736
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,130
I already talked to my mother.

737
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,950
Once you get married,
you'll understand my position.

738
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,620
I'm having a really hard time.

739
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,510
I'd rather give up being a politician
than losing my wife.

740
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,990
Please protect my family.

741
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,030
I'm begging you here. Please?

742
00:54:53,950 --> 00:55:00,600
<i>The call cannot be connected, so you
will be transferred to voicemail.</i>

743
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,550
Sis, it's me.

744
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,830
I have to talk with you
about Attorney Choi Jin Tae.

745
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,950
Please pick up the phone.

746
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,640
Sis!

747
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:27,910
Attorney Kim.

748
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,720
Really? She's coming?

749
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,670
Okay, let's meet there.

750
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,910
Yes, I'll head out now.

751
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,850
My district is near here,
so I use this room

752
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:47,100
to sleep over in while running
my campaign for election.

753
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,950
You came a long way.

754
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,300
Please get some rest and wait. I'll call
Attorney Kim Sang Wook to come here.

755
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,150
My goodness, you were here?

756
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,380
And you, too!

757
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:18,000
Have you gone insane?

758
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,810
How can you bring him over to my room?

759
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:34,500
Kim Sang Wook, you rascal...

760
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,910
- Is this true?
- Yes.

761
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,180
I'd like to request he be removed
from the attorney's list.

762
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,220
But I really do care about your son.

763
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:20,320
I can't block a young man's bright
future over one mistake.

764
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,530
Sir, please convince him
to change his mind soon.

765
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,760
Father!

766
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,790
What about my wife?
Where did she go?

767
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:56,680
I came as
Ms. Baek Seol's representative.

768
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,030
- Is something wrong?
- Huh?

769
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:01,330
Kim Sang Wook!

770
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,370
- Father.
- Why on earth...

771
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:14,480
did you work for some trash like him?

772
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,260
I turned in my resignation.

773
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,280
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

774
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,440
You did well.
Then get back to your work.

775
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,090
I am notifying you
as a representative of Ms. Baek Seol.

776
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:40,320
We will initiate the official procedure
for a divorce.

777
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,220
What? Are you going to be her lawyer?

778
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,930
I'll see you in court.

779
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,070
<i>[REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT]</i>

780
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,860
I told you not to go.
You didn't need to go!

781
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,300
I wanted to see how he'd act.

782
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,890
I can fight when I know about the enemy.

783
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,870
- Brother.
- I cannot stay out of this case now.

784
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,720
Please sign this now.

785
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,280
Excuse me, sir.

786
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,520
Yes.

787
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,900
We're supposed to watch
the first episode of Hitman today

788
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,280
so we have a lot of guests.

789
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,730
I see. I'll leave now.

790
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:20,890
- Yes, then...
- Why, why, why?

791
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,860
He's the legal counsel for our company.
Have a seat!

792
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,010
We're going to watch
the first episode here.

793
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,450
Yes, you should watch it with us.
How can you leave now?

794
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,970
You should. What are you doing?
You're stretching my sweater.

795

796

It's fun!

797
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,720
Ryu Hae Sung's acting is good!

798
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,320
I get at least one good cut
when I do it 10 times.

799
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,310
Was it really good though?

800
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,360
- It was really interesting.
- You'll have good ratings.

801
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,730
Our Writer Lee worked hard
to write the script!

802
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:23,170
Hae Sung, your action scenes
were really awesome.

803
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,160
That's my specialty.

804
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,200
He's right. Editing was good,
and the music was great!

805
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,520
Since we're all here together,
we should make a toast!

806
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,090
Bottles up!

807
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,420
Hey, hey!

808
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,430
Our good friends here together!

809
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,920
To the next 50 years
that we will share together!

810
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:53,910
- Right, for the next 100 years!
- Cheers!
