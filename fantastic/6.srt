3
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:18,592
<font color="yellow">Do you like me that much?</font>

4
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,030
<font color="yellow">Then do you want to sleep with me?</font>

5
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:32,509
<font color="yellow">Sleep? Now?</font>

6
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,353
<font color="yellow">Here?</font>

7
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:45,710
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

8
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,110
<font color="yellow">Were you kidding?</font>

9
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,875
<font color="yellow">Those jokes are not funny.</font>

10
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,743
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

11
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,468
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

12
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:41,168
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm sorry.</font>

13
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:44,784
<font color="yellow">- Continue what you were doing. Bye.
- Wait a second.</font>

14
00:01:44,784 --> 00:01:48,197
<font color="yellow">- Never mind.
- Why? Are you leaving?</font>

15
00:01:48,197 --> 00:01:51,281
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Finish what you were doing...</font>

16
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:54,813
<font color="yellow">I'm going to leave now.</font>

17
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,060
<font color="yellow">That jerk.</font>

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,947
<font color="yellow">Why would he come now?</font>

19
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,742
<font color="yellow">We didn't do anything.</font>

20
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:08,914
<font color="yellow">I was just worried that
the kimchi might get rotten.</font>

21
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,639
<font color="yellow">The kimchi refrigerator is set to
the "ripen" mode.</font>

22
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,087
<font color="yellow">I was going to change that
to "keep" mode and leave.</font>

23
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,669
<font color="yellow">We were doing a script reading.
Don't misinterpret this.</font>

24
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,265
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,135
<font color="yellow">Don't go.</font>

26
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:25,939
<font color="yellow">Why did you come? Why?</font>

27
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:29,185
<font color="yellow">Why did you come in at that moment?</font>

28
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:32,693
<font color="yellow">How could you say that? I came because
I was worried about you.</font>

29
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,401
<font color="yellow">If you were worried about me,
why did you disappear?</font>

30
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,802
<font color="yellow">You are not helpful at all.</font>

31
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,902
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'm leaving!</font>

32
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,312
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

33
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:48,884
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

34
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,408
<font color="yellow">That cold-hearted fellow.
We haven't seen each other for days...</font>

35
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,480
<font color="yellow">So Hye. So Hye.</font>

36
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,901
<font color="yellow">You are crazy, Lee So Hye.</font>

37
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:23,114
<font color="yellow">You are out of your mind.
How could you say that?</font>

38
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:38,123
<font color="yellow">Huh? Dr. Hong.</font>

39
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:39,950
<font color="yellow">You didn't answer your phone.</font>

40
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,540
<font color="yellow">Sung Hwa said you were in a meeting,
so I've been waiting for you.</font>

41
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,314
<font color="yellow">My phone ran out of battery.</font>

42
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:47,403
<font color="yellow">- Did you wait long?
- Yes.</font>

43
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:50,394
<font color="yellow">I have great news,
so I wanted to tell you myself.</font>

44
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,681
<font color="yellow">I bought the diligence of
the examination techs.</font>

45
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,330
<font color="yellow">I bought them some wine and meat.</font>

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,531
<font color="yellow">And they volunteered to work overnight.</font>

47
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,518
<font color="yellow">Your biopsy looks just fine.</font>

48
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:04,341
<font color="yellow">You can join the clinical trial.</font>

49
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:10,402
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

50
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,324
<font color="yellow">What kind of scene is that?</font>

51
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,137
<font color="yellow">She was making a move on me.</font>

52
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,276
<font color="yellow">And now she's with Hong Joon Ki?</font>

53
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,831
<font color="yellow">You've been through a lot.
Thank you for hanging in there.</font>

54
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:34,468
<font color="yellow">- Thank you, Dr. Hong.
- I'm thankful you're okay.</font>

55
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,279
<font color="yellow">I want to throw a party to celebrate.</font>

56
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,254
<font color="yellow">But since you have to come to
the hospital tomorrow morning</font>

57
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,954
<font color="yellow">you should take a rest today.</font>

58
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,579
<font color="yellow">It would be weird if
I could hear them from here.</font>

59
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,182
<font color="yellow">This is the clinical trial schedule.</font>

60
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,422
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

61
00:04:51,422 --> 00:04:53,401
<font color="yellow">I will repay you for your generosity.</font>

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,579
<font color="yellow">Hong Joon Ki.</font>

63
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:23,014
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Hong.
- Mr. Ryu Hae Sung.</font>

64
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:25,846
<font color="yellow">- Let's talk.
- What about?</font>

65
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:28,771
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship
with Lee So Hye?</font>

66
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:31,704
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me?
You should talk with Writer Lee.</font>

67
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:36,062
<font color="yellow">No. I want to talk
with Mr. Hong Joon Ki.</font>

68
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,341
<font color="yellow">What's your relationship with her?</font>

69
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:41,466
<font color="yellow">Do you really want to know?</font>

70
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:51,862
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
I said I want to talk with you.</font>

71
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:56,031
<font color="yellow">Beat me. Then I'll tell you
my relationship with Writer Lee.</font>

72
00:05:56,031 --> 00:06:00,363
<font color="yellow">Gosh. What in the world is he saying?</font>

73
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:01,927
<font color="yellow">How good are you at pool?</font>

74
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:05,392
<font color="yellow">You know how to play, right?</font>

75
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:07,411
<font color="yellow">My average is 400.</font>

76
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:09,675
<font color="yellow">- You?
- My average is 300.</font>

77
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,026
<font color="yellow">But it has been a while
since I played billiards.</font>

78
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,677
<font color="yellow">300 sounds like a good number to me.</font>

79
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:20,115
<font color="yellow">- Let's do that then.
- This is ridiculous.</font>

80
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,230
<font color="yellow">Why does he want to play billiards
all of a sudden?</font>

81
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,713
<font color="yellow">Jeez.</font>

82
00:06:33,713 --> 00:06:36,560
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with this cue?</font>

83
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,182
<font color="yellow">Why? It looks fine.</font>

84
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:40,764
<font color="yellow">Let's switch it.</font>

85
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,971
<font color="yellow">Look at him.</font>

86
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:57,031
<font color="yellow">Sir, I won!</font>

87
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:01,550
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Now, tell me.</font>

88
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,235
<font color="yellow">What are you two up to?</font>

89
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,346
<font color="yellow">You guys are not dating, right?</font>

90
00:08:07,346 --> 00:08:09,966
<font color="yellow">We are not dating yet.</font>

91
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:13,848
<font color="yellow">Look at him. I knew it.</font>

92
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:15,755
<font color="yellow">But.</font>

93
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:18,168
<font color="yellow">I haven't give up yet.</font>

94
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,937
<font color="yellow">You are in trouble now.</font>

95
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:40,379
<font color="yellow">How could you try to fool me?</font>

96
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,120
<font color="yellow">Hey, Chang Seok.</font>

97
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,716
<font color="yellow">Where did he go now?</font>

98
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,695
<font color="yellow"><i>Please just remember that I like you.</i></font>

99
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,509
<font color="yellow"><i>Never try to find me.</i></font>

100
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,826
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm going to chase after my dream.</i></font>

101
00:09:01,826 --> 00:09:04,736
<font color="yellow"><i>Please forget about me,
and find a good manager.</i></font>

102
00:09:07,587 --> 00:09:10,484
<font color="yellow">Gosh, only if he is not older than me...</font>

103
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:12,932
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

104
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,745
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung!</font>

105
00:09:35,163 --> 00:09:39,658
<font color="yellow">- Stop it. Come here now.
- How did you know I was here?</font>

106
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,085
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

107
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,907
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

108
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:48,019
<font color="yellow">What do you mean how did I know?
You sent me the address and the map.</font>

109
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:52,254
<font color="yellow">Okay. I knew that you would come.</font>

110
00:09:52,254 --> 00:09:55,298
<font color="yellow">I'm not helpful at all.
Why do you like me?</font>

111
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,509
<font color="yellow">When did I say I like you?</font>

112
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:00,797
<font color="yellow">What is wrong with your face?</font>

113
00:10:00,797 --> 00:10:02,349
<font color="yellow">Why did you become so thin?</font>

114
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:04,019
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I got thin?</font>

115
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,802
<font color="yellow">Just get in the car.</font>

116
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:10,090
<font color="yellow">No. I will only be a distraction to you.</font>

117
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,475
<font color="yellow">- You can just...
- Gosh.</font>

118
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:14,333
<font color="yellow">Then just stand here like this.</font>

119
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,919
<font color="yellow">Why would a top star drive?</font>

120
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,451
<font color="yellow">I will drive.</font>

121
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:26,274
<font color="yellow">The ramen I made is the best, right?</font>

122
00:10:29,866 --> 00:10:34,110
<font color="yellow">You don't have to care
about CEO Choi now.</font>

123
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,674
<font color="yellow">I hired you. I'm your boss.</font>

124
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,984
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

125
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:44,057
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You rascal.</font>

126
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:48,215
<font color="yellow">I will do everything for you.
Just tell me.</font>

127
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:53,836
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee and I.</font>

128
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:56,623
<font color="yellow">Please help us get together.</font>

129
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,426
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

130
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:01,383
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung, it's me.</font>

131
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:04,658
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.  You guys are in good hands.</font>

132
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,356
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

133
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:09,792
<font color="yellow">Really? Great.</font>

134
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,471
<font color="yellow">Can I trust you?</font>

135
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,232
<font color="yellow">I'm going to bed.</font>

136
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,157
<font color="yellow">See you in dreams.</font>

137
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:21,091
<font color="yellow">No, meet Writer Lee in dreams.
Your wife, Writer Lee.</font>

138
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,256
<font color="yellow">Just wait, Lee So Hye.</font>

139
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:35,556
<font color="yellow">I will hold your tumbling heart.</font>

140
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,875
<font color="yellow">Then do you want to sleep with me?</font>

141
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,875
<font color="yellow">Then that means she really meant it.</font>

142
00:11:56,553 --> 00:11:58,192
<font color="yellow">Hold on a second.</font>

143
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:04,602
<font color="yellow">Then what was that?</font>

144
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,365
<font color="yellow">Thankful for what?</font>

145
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:19,551
<font color="yellow">What is she repaying?</font>

146
00:12:21,293 --> 00:12:22,985
<font color="yellow">By any chance...</font>

147
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:26,168
<font color="yellow"><i>It must be tough for you.
CEO Choi doesn't even pay you.</i></font>

148
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:29,519
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, it's tough.</i></font>

149
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,668
<font color="yellow"><i>This is money.
Take this, and please date me.</i></font>

150
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,371
<font color="yellow"><i>I can't do that.</i></font>

151
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,287
<font color="yellow"><i>I like Hae Sung.</i></font>

152
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,423
<font color="yellow"><i>I just asked him to sleep with me.</i></font>

153
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:41,690
<font color="yellow"><i>That's okay. I'm not going to give up.</i></font>

154
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,173
<font color="yellow"><i>Please take it. There's no interest.</i></font>

155
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:47,275
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm a hospital director,
I have a lot of money.</i></font>

156
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:49,847
<font color="yellow"><i>I have more estates than Ryu Hae Sung.</i></font>

157
00:12:49,847 --> 00:12:54,346
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you. I will repay you
for your generosity.</i></font>

158
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:56,366
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

159
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:59,530
<font color="yellow">She borrowed money from him for sure.</font>

160
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,379
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

161
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,456
<font color="yellow">She couldn't like
someone like him over me.</font>

162
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:09,011
<font color="yellow">Okay. Now I can solve this puzzle.</font>

163
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,506
<font color="yellow">Okay, that was it.</font>

164
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,888
<font color="yellow">Now the game is over.</font>

165
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,681
<font color="yellow">The game is over.</font>

166
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,331
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye. Wait.</font>

167
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:24,268
<font color="yellow">I will hold you tight in my arms.</font>

168
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:28,433
<font color="yellow">I will never let you go.</font>

169
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,139
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye.</font>

170
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,048
<font color="yellow">This is tiring.</font>

171
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:39,604
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye.</font>

172
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,145
<font color="yellow">Thanks for your hard work.</font>

173
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:45,381
<font color="yellow">I'm back.</font>

174
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,653
<font color="yellow">- You must be tired.
- Yes.</font>

175
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,561
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

176
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:46,023
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

177
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:48,558
<font color="yellow">If you keep pushing me away,
it's dereliction of duty.</font>

178
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,798
<font color="yellow">Do I have to hold the man who has
another woman's lipstick on his clothes?</font>

179
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:56,464
<font color="yellow">- Is that what the law says?
- Huh?</font>

180
00:14:56,464 --> 00:14:58,874
<font color="yellow">Why are you accusing me again?</font>

181
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,572
<font color="yellow">Where? Where is that lipstick print?</font>

182
00:15:07,764 --> 00:15:10,787
<font color="yellow">Lee Mi Do.
When did she get that on there?</font>

183
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:14,552
<font color="yellow">She's so careless.</font>

184
00:15:14,552 --> 00:15:15,552
<font color="yellow">Jeez.</font>

185
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:46,750
<font color="yellow"><i>[Marital rape]</i></font>

186
00:15:53,225 --> 00:15:55,947
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

187
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,755
<font color="yellow">I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

188
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:04,996
<font color="yellow">Why did you leave all these lights on?</font>

189
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:07,148
<font color="yellow">No wonder the electricity bill went up.</font>

190
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:11,554
<font color="yellow">Why would you waste it? You know our
country can't produce oil.</font>

191
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,649
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

192
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,328
<font color="yellow">Our family treasures are here.</font>

193
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,807
<font color="yellow">Don't come in here if you don't have to.</font>

194
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:22,801
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mother.</font>

195
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:25,092
<font color="yellow">- Good night.
- Okay.</font>

196
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,693
<font color="yellow"><i>Sister, are you asleep?</i></font>

197
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:05,768

<font color="yellow"><i>Brother.</i></font>

205
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:50,586
<font color="yellow"><i>The answer is vitamin C.</i></font>

206
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:52,867
<font color="yellow"><i>"Brother" is also a right answer.</i></font>

00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:06,288
<font color="yellow"><i>Well. Sister.</i></font>

210
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:08,567
<font color="yellow"><i>What?</i></font>

211
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,048
<font color="yellow"><i>To be honest... I saw your name.</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Your name is very special and pretty.</i></font>

214
00:18:18,529 --> 00:18:20,376
<font color="yellow"><i>So you did see it.</i></font>

215
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:22,375
<font color="yellow"><i>It's unfair if I know your name
and you don't know my name.</i></font>

Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

221
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:52,632

<font color="yellow"><i>Sister, your motorcycle is not here.
Did you go for a ride?</i></font>

227

<font color="yellow">Please be careful. We're in trouble if
we scratch this expensive wooden floor.</font>

228
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:55,085
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

229
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,361
<font color="yellow">Be careful when you
put your equipment down.</font>

230
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:59,990
<font color="yellow">Director Yoon, are you okay?</font>

231
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,673
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

232
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,223
<font color="yellow">Director Yoon, are you okay?</font>

233
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:11,373
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung said he has
something to tell you.</font>

234
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:14,010
<font color="yellow">- He is waiting for you in his room.
- He has something to say to me?</font>

236
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:34,160
<font color="yellow">Okay. Got it.</font>

237
00:20:49,086 --> 00:20:51,442
<font color="yellow">Oh, Writer Lee. You're here.</font>

238
00:20:56,397 --> 00:21:00,790
<font color="yellow">I hit the jackpot with my stocks.</font>

239
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,967
<font color="yellow">- Why did you want to see me?
- Oh...</font>

240
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:07,134
<font color="yellow">About that car accident.</font>

241
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,749
<font color="yellow">- Let's forget about that.
- Really?</font>

242
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:11,943
<font color="yellow">As you can see, I'm swimming in money.</font>

243
00:21:15,592 --> 00:21:17,703
<font color="yellow">Let me know if you need money.</font>

244
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,750
<font color="yellow">I'll give you a low interest rate.
Lower than the bank.</font>

245
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,608
<font color="yellow">Actually. Forget that. No interest.
I'm too lazy to collect interest.</font>

246
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,394
<font color="yellow">I'm having trouble using all this money.
Why would I need interest?</font>

247
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:30,493
<font color="yellow">I don't need it. Don't waste time
on those useless things.</font>

248
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,414
<font color="yellow">Practice reading your lines.</font>

249
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,846
<font color="yellow">You have long lines today.
Did you memorize them all?</font>

250
00:21:34,846 --> 00:21:37,145
<font color="yellow">Of course.
You don't have to repeat yourself.</font>

251
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:46,057
<font color="yellow">You're not exposing your body today
on the set. Why are you doing that?</font>

252
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:51,201
<font color="yellow">Oh. I was exercising, and I forgot...</font>

253
00:21:51,201 --> 00:21:54,063
<font color="yellow">You're done talking, right? Bye.</font>

254
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,702
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

255
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,836
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

256
00:22:00,836 --> 00:22:03,304
<font color="yellow">When is our D-day?</font>

257
00:22:03,304 --> 00:22:05,836
<font color="yellow">- D-day?
- You made a suggestion yesterday.</font>

258
00:22:05,836 --> 00:22:09,050
<font color="yellow">"Do you like me that much?
Let's sleep together."</font>

259
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,001
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind? This is
the filming set. People might hear us.</font>

260
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,125
<font color="yellow">It feels nice to be close like this.</font>

261
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,387
<font color="yellow">Forget about what happened that day.
Okay?</font>

262
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:23,487
<font color="yellow">It was a great suggestion.
Why would I forget about that?</font>

263
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:25,414
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's talk again after the filming.</font>

264
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:27,906
<font color="yellow">I have an appointment.
I'm going talk about editing points</font>

265
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:30,380
<font color="yellow">- with Director Yoon and leave.
- An appointment?</font>

266
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,338
<font color="yellow">With who?</font>

267
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:33,981
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me... Hong Joon Ki?</font>

268
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:42,084
<font color="yellow">- We are ready. Please standby.
- Okay.</font>

269
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:44,049
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

270
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:50,362
<font color="yellow">Oh, I will be there soon.</font>

271
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,920
<font color="yellow">Since it's our first meeting together,
I just wanted to say hello.</font>

272
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,498
<font color="yellow">I brought sandwiches for everyone.</font>

273
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:57,861
<font color="yellow">We will see each other a lot.</font>

274
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:00,585
<font color="yellow">Let's eat lunch and introduce ourselves.</font>

275
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:04,252
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Kim Yeo Eun.</font>

276
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,896
<font color="yellow">I had breast cancer, and
it has been metastasized to bones.</font>

277

278
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:11,227

Nice to meet you all.</font>

280
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:23,617
<font color="yellow">I have stage four breast cancer, and it
has metastasized to my lymph nodes.</font>

282
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,695

and an employee there</font>

283

<font color="yellow">told me that I had a lump in my breast.</font>

284
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:38,019
<font color="yellow">And my useless husband ran away
with another girl.</font>

285
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:41,108
<font color="yellow">From chemotherapy to surgery...</font>

286
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:45,105
<font color="yellow">I have experienced
everything except for dying.</font>

287
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,047
<font color="yellow">So you guys have to let me be the boss.</font>

288
00:23:47,047 --> 00:23:50,037
<font color="yellow">I'm the boss of this team. Okay?</font>

289
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:53,588
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

290
00:23:53,588 --> 00:23:55,652

293
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,492
<font color="yellow">My husband had a car accident, and
he is paralyzed from the waist down.</font>

294
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,700
<font color="yellow">I have to raise the kids.</font>

295
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,440
<font color="yellow">And I have to run
the business by myself.</font>

296
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,797
<font color="yellow">It can't relapse. I can't die.</font>

297
00:24:12,797 --> 00:24:17,055
<font color="yellow">Let's fight though this together.</font>

298
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,682
<font color="yellow">- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.</font>

00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:32,105
<font color="yellow">I was diagnosed with cancer
not too long ago.</font>

303
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:35,036
<font color="yellow">After listening to your stories</font>

304
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:38,961
<font color="yellow">I realized that I have been a crybaby.
It was a chance to reflect on myself.</font>

305
00:24:38,961 --> 00:24:42,354
<font color="yellow">I will take the courage and
fight through this.</font>

306
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,459
<font color="yellow">Have you told your family and friends
that you have cancer?</font>

307
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:50,738
<font color="yellow">No, not yet.</font>

308
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:53,337
<font color="yellow">I had a hard time because of that.</font>

309
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:57,588
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to make them worried,
And I didn't want to be pitied.</font>

310
00:24:57,588 --> 00:24:59,659
<font color="yellow">But you have to tell them quickly.</font>

311
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:02,270
<font color="yellow">You can't fight cancer alone.</font>

312
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,084
<font color="yellow">You have to rip it, chew it,
and fight it.</font>

313
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:06,847
<font color="yellow">That's how you can win this.</font>

314
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,415
<font color="yellow">It was a strange experience.</font>

315
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:17,682
<font color="yellow">It felt like I met my fellow soldiers
in the middle of a battle field.</font>

316
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,990
<font color="yellow">People who have never had this disease
don't really know what it's like.</font>

317
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:26,198
<font color="yellow">How's your condition now?</font>

318
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:27,738
<font color="yellow">Are you cancer-free?</font>

319
00:25:27,738 --> 00:25:29,921
<font color="yellow">I'm still fighting.</font>

320
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:32,069
<font color="yellow">I'm still on the battlefield.</font>

321
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:33,865
<font color="yellow">And I get bombarded.</font>

322
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:37,934
<font color="yellow">You don't look like
a cancer patient at all.</font>

323
00:25:37,934 --> 00:25:40,413
<font color="yellow">I guess you get used to
cancer after awhile.</font>

324
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:50,207
<font color="yellow">By the way. When are you going to tell
Ryu Hye Sung about this?</font>

325
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:52,530
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to tell him.</font>

326
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,851
<font color="yellow">That might change if I get a good result
in the clinical trial.</font>

327
00:25:58,943 --> 00:26:03,665
<font color="yellow">When I was diagnosed with cancer,
I had a girlfriend.</font>

328
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:06,689
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard I pushed her away,
she stayed by my side for two years.</font>

329
00:26:06,689 --> 00:26:08,300
<font color="yellow">Then she left.</font>

330
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:14,005
<font color="yellow">She's married now,
and she is doing well.</font>

331
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,431
<font color="yellow">I think about this from time to time.</font>

332
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:19,373
<font color="yellow">If I let her go without telling her
about my illness...</font>

333
00:26:19,373 --> 00:26:22,449
<font color="yellow">How great would that have been?</font>

334
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,555
<font color="yellow">She wouldn't blame herself,
and she would be happier.</font>

335
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:34,136
<font color="yellow">But if I was her,
I would have wanted to know it for sure.</font>

336
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:37,238
<font color="yellow">"Even though I couldn't stay by his side
until the very end"</font>

337
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:40,865
<font color="yellow">"it's a relief that
I could do something for him."</font>

338
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,704
<font color="yellow">I think that's what
she might have thought.</font>

339
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:48,461
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

340
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:53,820
<font color="yellow">Oh, Attorney Kim. Welcome.</font>

341
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,403
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

342
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:03,702
<font color="yellow">- Take a look at this one.
- Okay.</font>

343
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,366
<font color="yellow">This is the case
from a woman's  organization</font>

344
00:27:06,366 --> 00:27:08,579
<font color="yellow">that we are defending for free.</font>

345
00:27:08,579 --> 00:27:11,560
<font color="yellow">Marital rape, assault.</font>

346
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,653
<font color="yellow">The client is from Vietnam.</font>

347
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:16,932
<font color="yellow">What's your opinion on this case?</font>

348
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:20,612
<font color="yellow">Three years ago, a man who met his wife
though a marriage broker</font>

349
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:24,098
<font color="yellow">purposely assaulted and raped her.</font>

350
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:27,261
<font color="yellow">He was sentenced to jail for five years.
But he appealed and made an agreement.</font>

351
00:27:27,261 --> 00:27:31,209
<font color="yellow">He was sentenced to jail for three years
and was on probation for four years.</font>

352
00:27:31,209 --> 00:27:35,807
<font color="yellow">Since they are still married, it won't be
easy to prove that it was forced.</font>

353
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:40,056
<font color="yellow">But I think we might be able to win.</font>

354
00:27:40,056 --> 00:27:42,730
<font color="yellow">Great. You take that case.</font>

355
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,761
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will do my best.</font>

356
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,028
<font color="yellow"><i>[Sent from Web: New insurance plan.

357
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,634
<font color="yellow">Girlfriend?</font>

358
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,921
<font color="yellow">What? No.</font>

359
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:00,704
<font color="yellow">You seem like you have a girlfriend.</font>

360
00:28:00,704 --> 00:28:03,313
<font color="yellow">Should I introduce you to someone?</font>

361
00:28:03,313 --> 00:28:07,380
<font color="yellow">Actually...</font>

362
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,133
<font color="yellow">- There's someone I like.
- Right?</font>

363
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,522
<font color="yellow">I wonder who that is.</font>

364
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:19,923
<font color="yellow">- Introduce her to me.
- Okay. If I get a chance...</font>

365
00:28:19,923 --> 00:28:24,247
<font color="yellow">Should I tell you how you can
get her to be your girlfriend?</font>

366
00:28:24,247 --> 00:28:26,642
<font color="yellow">You have to respect her.</font>

367
00:28:26,642 --> 00:28:29,087
<font color="yellow">Men back in the day
protected their women.</font>

368
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,009
<font color="yellow">But men these days respect their women.</font>

369
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,962
<font color="yellow">Oh, respect.</font>

370
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,892
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your words.</font>

371
00:28:35,892 --> 00:28:37,632
<font color="yellow">To make it simple, it's a give and take.</font>

372
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,416
<font color="yellow">You will be respected
if you respect her.</font>

373
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,616
<font color="yellow">Your wife must be very happy.</font>

374
00:28:43,616 --> 00:28:47,066
<font color="yellow">She was lucky to meet someone like you.</font>

375
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:49,772
<font color="yellow">Make your girlfriend happy too.</font>

376
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:52,680
<font color="yellow">Pick a date. I will buy you guys a meal.</font>

377
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,288
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

378
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,076
<font color="yellow">Did Writer Lee go to the set?</font>

379
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:09,541
<font color="yellow">Yes. She said she has to edit the script.</font>

380
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,641
<font color="yellow">Why did you want to see me?</font>

381
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:17,795
<font color="yellow"><i>[Hitman]</i>
You wrote this, right?</font>

382
00:29:17,795 --> 00:29:20,515
<font color="yellow">No, Writer Lee wrote it.</font>

383
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,259
<font color="yellow">Your name is on the file.</font>

384
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:27,250
<font color="yellow">Oh, I was editing it,
and I put my name in.</font>

385
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,413
<font color="yellow">You must have come up with a lot of
ideas in the meeting.</font>

386
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:31,134
<font color="yellow">You made a big contribution.</font>

387
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:33,736
<font color="yellow">I should make some contribution.
I'm an assistant writer.</font>

388
00:29:33,736 --> 00:29:35,568
<font color="yellow">But why are you saying this?</font>

389
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:42,803
<font color="yellow">You are way behind
your father's hospital bills.</font>

390
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:45,894
<font color="yellow">Take care of that with this money.
Let him receive surgery.</font>

391
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:48,038
<font color="yellow">- How did you find that out?
- I heard you were studying for</font>

392
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,531
<font color="yellow">the National Exam and you decided to
become a writer. To earn money.</font>

393
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:52,684
<font color="yellow">You are competent and smart. Are you
going to stay as an assistant writer and</font>

394
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:54,837
<font color="yellow">waste your ideas away?</font>

395
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:56,442
<font color="yellow">You should make a debut.
You should write your own drama.</font>

396
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:59,541
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee said she is going to
help me debut.</font>

397
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:02,339
<font color="yellow">Huh? She said that again?</font>

398
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,230
<font color="yellow">That's a lie.</font>

399
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,595
<font color="yellow">Why would she let you have her job?</font>

400
00:30:06,595 --> 00:30:09,275
<font color="yellow">She's written ten dramas. Have you
ever seen her help anyone debut?</font>

401
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,853
<font color="yellow">She took everything for herself.</font>

402
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:14,461
<font color="yellow">This is a brutal field.
You have to compete with everyone.</font>

403
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,874
<font color="yellow">If you want to go higher,
you have to  step on someone.</font>

404
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:18,951
<font color="yellow">That's how you survive.</font>

405
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,634
<font color="yellow">Sign a contract with me.</font>

406
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:22,939
<font color="yellow">A hundred-episode drama.
I'll give you 8 million won per episode.</font>

407
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:25,500

408
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,403
<font color="yellow">It's 8 million won.</font>

409
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:30,387
<font color="yellow">You should buy an apartment and
pay back your debt.</font>

410
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:32,358

in that tiny room?</font>

411
00:30:32,358 --> 00:30:35,838
<font color="yellow">Take the money and visit your father
at the hospital.</font>

412
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:37,663
<font color="yellow">I'll get the contract ready.</font>

419
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:15,545
<font color="yellow">I learned about everything in here.
Even the tiny little details.</font>

420
00:31:15,545 --> 00:31:18,241
<font color="yellow">I'm starting to forget them.</font>

421
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:20,055
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm becoming dull.</font>

422
00:31:20,055 --> 00:31:22,414
<font color="yellow">I should write everything down.</font>

423
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:26,652
<font color="yellow">- That would be the wise thing to do.
- Yes.</font>

<font color="yellow">Let's take a note on that drawing first.
That's the expensive one.</font>

<font color="yellow">Okay, Mother.</font>

427
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,775

00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,456
<font color="yellow">- Thank you.
- Thanks for the hard work.</font>

450
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:36,010
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung.</font>

451
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,510
<font color="yellow">You are here. Welcome.</font>

452
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,005
<font color="yellow">Writer Sang Hwa.</font>

453
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:45,512
<font color="yellow">- The assistant writer?
- Yes.</font>

454
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:47,632
<font color="yellow">She has family issues.</font>

455
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,318
<font color="yellow">She won't be able to refuse it.</font>

456
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,206
<font color="yellow">Even so, how could she
fall over some money?</font>

457
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:58,222
<font color="yellow">She should show loyalty.</font>

458
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:03,003
<font color="yellow">Her father is sick, but she doesn't have
money to get him surgery.</font>

459
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,384
<font color="yellow">She's not answering her phone.</font>

460
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,612
<font color="yellow">I think she made up her mind already.</font>

461
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:09,916
<font color="yellow">Why can't we get a hold of So Hye?</font>

462
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,884
<font color="yellow">Is she writing the script
and turned her phone off?</font>

463
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,362
<font color="yellow">By any chance, is she with that doctor?</font>

464
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:20,070
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying.</font>

465
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,983
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't care
about those things now.</font>

466
00:35:21,983 --> 00:35:24,507
<font color="yellow">Don't you know his phone number?</font>

467
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:26,266
<font color="yellow">I will find out.</font>

468
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,045
<font color="yellow">Is this Sungdong Hospital?</font>

469
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,672
<font color="yellow">Can I speak with Director Hong Joon Ki?</font>

470
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,581
<font color="yellow">He's off today?</font>

471
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,643
<font color="yellow">Please tell her to call me
when you get a hold of her.</font>

472
00:35:51,643 --> 00:35:53,405
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

473
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,659
<font color="yellow">Bye Mi Sun. Say hello to Pil Ho for me.</font>

474
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,190
<font color="yellow">I'm still on your side.</font>

475
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,784
<font color="yellow">Take this chance and become her hero.
It's time to make a move on her. Okay?</font>

476
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:05,835
<font color="yellow">- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.</font>

477
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:07,409
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

478
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,161
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

479
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,492
<font color="yellow">- Where are you going?
- Huh?</font>

480
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:25,324
<font color="yellow">Who is that brilliant woman?</font>

481
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,753
<font color="yellow">Wake up.</font>

482
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,128
<font color="yellow">She's married.</font>

483
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,864
<font color="yellow">We have time until
the next night filming, right?</font>

484
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,440
<font color="yellow">I think I have to go somewhere.</font>

485
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:41,472
<font color="yellow">Married?</font>

486
00:36:41,472 --> 00:36:43,036
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

487
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:29,764
<font color="yellow">I have an urgent matter.
I have to contact Director Hong Joon Ki.</font>

488
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,974
<font color="yellow">Director Hong is not
in this office today.</font>

489
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:34,442
<font color="yellow">Oh. His personal phone number.</font>

490
00:37:34,442 --> 00:37:36,534
<font color="yellow">I want to know his phone number...</font>

491
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:41,393
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but I can't tell you
his personal phone number.</font>

492
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,998
<font color="yellow">Just a moment please.</font>

493
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,009
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

494
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:06,974
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

495
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:18,224
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

496
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,458
<font color="yellow">Do you know where Writer Lee is?</font>

497
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,110
<font color="yellow">Yes. I know.</font>

498
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:27,454
<font color="yellow">You know?</font>

499
00:38:27,454 --> 00:38:29,230
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

500
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,583
<font color="yellow">Where is she?</font>

501
00:38:32,583 --> 00:38:36,543
<font color="yellow">Well. I can't really tell you.</font>

502
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:38,559
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You are doing this again.</font>

503
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:41,067
<font color="yellow">I have an urgent matter.</font>

504
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:45,268
<font color="yellow">- Where is she?
- I can let you see her in an hour.</font>

505
00:38:50,143 --> 00:38:51,724
<font color="yellow">This way please.</font>

506
00:38:56,617 --> 00:38:59,266
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to take
an x-ray all of a sudden?</font>

507
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:01,750
<font color="yellow">We should take a look at your rib
when you have time.</font>

508
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,889
<font color="yellow">If you leave your broken rib
like that and if it</font>

509
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:07,400
<font color="yellow">pokes organs or blood vessels nearby,
what are you going to do?</font>

510
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,018
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

511
00:39:09,018 --> 00:39:12,706
<font color="yellow">I think I have some pain on this side.</font>

512
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:15,954
<font color="yellow">So since you are here,
let's hurry and take some x-rays.</font>

513
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,878
<font color="yellow">Let's draw some blood too.</font>

514
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,387
<font color="yellow">- Why all of a sudden...
- Let's do a check-up.</font>

515
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:26,101
<font color="yellow">You can be in love only
when you are healthy.</font>

516
00:39:26,101 --> 00:39:31,655
<font color="yellow">Being healthy is the best happiness
that you can give to your woman.</font>

517
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,922
<font color="yellow">- Here we go.
- Wait, wait. Okay.</font>

518
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,572
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

519
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,389
<font color="yellow">Your ribs are healing well.</font>

520
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:45,726
<font color="yellow">I will let you know about your blood
test results as soon as possible.</font>

521
00:39:46,378 --> 00:39:47,755
<font color="yellow">What about Writer Lee?</font>

522
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:51,452
<font color="yellow">Right... She's taking too long.</font>

523
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:53,271
<font color="yellow">What is that urgent matter?</font>

524
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:55,789
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you either.</font>

525
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:58,563
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I have to go film now.</font>

526
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,134
<font color="yellow">You can just go then. I will call you
right away when I see Writer Lee.</font>

527
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,963
<font color="yellow">That was your phone number, right?</font>

528
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,985
<font color="yellow">You have to call me right away.</font>

529
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,425
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

530
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:20,748
<font color="yellow">My cell phone number.
You shouldn't tell that to anyone.</font>

531
00:40:20,748 --> 00:40:23,882
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll preciously keep it to myself.</font>

532
00:40:28,878 --> 00:40:32,257
<font color="yellow">Why does he keep smiling?
I might become attached to him.</font>

533
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:34,121
<font color="yellow">He's a funny guy.</font>

is doing me good.</font>

<font color="yellow">What are you going to say this time?</font>

542
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:37,036
<font color="yellow">It's not one of those embarrassing jokes.</font>

543
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,510
<font color="yellow">It's to help you not get surprised.</font>

544
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,152

<font color="yellow">I have been working with her
for three years</font>

558
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,902
<font color="yellow">and I don't even know
where her house is.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm always like this.</font>

560

I just hung up on her.</font>

Let's make a counterargument.</font>

563
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:11,155
<font color="yellow">Sang Hwa will call me back.
She wouldn't do this either.</font>

564

you have to catch somebody first.</font>

592
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:20,072
<font color="yellow">But why are you
doing this to Writer Lee?</font>

593
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:23,833
<font color="yellow">She only takes money,
and she is not doing her job.</font>

594
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:26,226
<font color="yellow">- And she doesn't listen to me.
- Why?</font>

595
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:29,679
<font color="yellow">She never sent you an unfinished script.
She really works hard.</font>

596
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,347
<font color="yellow">I want a new and fresh person like you.
One who has a fresh brain.</font>

597
00:46:33,347 --> 00:46:35,556
<font color="yellow">You are scared of Writer Lee, right?</font>

598
00:46:35,556 --> 00:46:38,501
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I will protect you.</font>

599
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:42,262
<font color="yellow">Trust me, and focus on
writing your script. Okay?</font>

600
00:46:42,262 --> 00:46:43,898
<font color="yellow">You said you are going to give me</font>

601
00:46:43,898 --> 00:46:47,378
<font color="yellow">100 episodes and
eight million won per episode, right?</font>

602
00:46:47,378 --> 00:46:51,561
<font color="yellow">- That's right.
- She is clever and meticulous.</font>

603
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,737
<font color="yellow">She knows how to sign a contract.</font>

604
00:46:54,737 --> 00:46:57,295
<font color="yellow">Then what's going to happen
to Writer Lee now?</font>

605
00:46:57,295 --> 00:47:01,782
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? She will go to a
different company, and make a living.</font>

606
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:04,527
<font color="yellow">You know, it takes three generations
for the rich to fail.</font>

607
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:09,358
<font color="yellow">What is that bag that you have there?
Are you a beggar?</font>

608
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:14,668
<font color="yellow">A writer should have
something like this.</font>

609
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:16,902
<font color="yellow">- It's my gift.
- Wow.</font>

610
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:20,916
<font color="yellow">It's a luxury brand, very cool!
And this is very delicious.</font>

611
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,704
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, I'm sorry.</font>

612
00:47:29,704 --> 00:47:31,713
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me.</font>

613
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:35,815
<font color="yellow">Oh my.</font>

614
00:47:35,815 --> 00:47:38,994
<font color="yellow">Choi Jin Seok, you are a bitch.</font>

615
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:45,427
<font color="yellow">You can have this bag.</font>

616
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:48,659
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What is wrong with you?</font>

617
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:50,226
<font color="yellow">Do you know what this is?</font>

618
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,813
<font color="yellow">I recorded everything you said.</font>

619
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:56,277
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to be embarrassed</font>

620
00:47:56,277 --> 00:47:58,405
<font color="yellow">send out a revised article
and apologize to our Writer Lee.</font>

621
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:01,943
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'm going to spread this
all over the internet tonight.</font>

622
00:48:01,943 --> 00:48:03,447
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

623
00:48:06,766 --> 00:48:08,864
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

624
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:10,871
<font color="yellow">That's a illegal recording.</font>

625
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:14,271
<font color="yellow">Secret recordings can't be
used as proof.</font>

626
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,652
<font color="yellow">I went to law school for four years.</font>

627
00:48:17,652 --> 00:48:19,291
<font color="yellow">Protection of Communications Secrets Act
punishes people who</font>

628
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:22,014
<font color="yellow">records a conversation
between other people.</font>

629
00:48:22,014 --> 00:48:25,443
<font color="yellow">As long as the recorder
is part of the conversation</font>

630
00:48:25,443 --> 00:48:27,871
<font color="yellow">it is not illegal.</font>

631
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:31,358
<font color="yellow">Did you understand me?
Idiot Ms. Lawsuit?</font>

632
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:42,210
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing there? Go stop her.</font>

633
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,621
<font color="yellow">- Secretary Yang, go stop her.
- Okay.</font>

634
00:48:50,657 --> 00:48:53,152
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

635
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:56,288
<font color="yellow">- CEO Choi.
- It hurts.</font>

636
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,268
<font color="yellow">- Did you complete your mission?
- Yes.</font>

637
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:13,873
<font color="yellow">I even have the video recording.</font>

638
00:49:13,873 --> 00:49:16,271
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

639
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:32,090
<font color="yellow">Writer Sang Hwa.</font>

640
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:58,288
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

641
00:49:58,288 --> 00:50:01,831
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to betray Writer Lee.</font>

642
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:04,447
<font color="yellow">But.</font>

643
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:12,498
<font color="yellow">I'm embarrassed that I fell for
her words and contemplated it.</font>

644
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:15,561
<font color="yellow">The one who gave you such a dilemma
is the bad one.</font>

645
00:50:15,561 --> 00:50:21,324
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell the truth
and quit being a writer.</font>

646
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:25,226
<font color="yellow">A person like me has no right to write.</font>

647
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:30,550
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go back to my hometown
and get on a shrimp boat.</font>

648
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,733
<font color="yellow">Do you think working on a shrimp boat
is for everyone?</font>

649
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:37,775
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.
Sign a contract with me.</font>

650
00:50:37,775 --> 00:50:40,675
<font color="yellow">- What?
- But I have some conditions.</font>

651
00:50:40,675 --> 00:50:45,914
<font color="yellow">First. On your first drama,
you must cast me.</font>

652
00:50:45,914 --> 00:50:49,594
<font color="yellow">Second. Don't leave me out because
of my "foot acting."</font>

653
00:50:49,594 --> 00:50:53,021
<font color="yellow">And third.</font>

654
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:56,454
<font color="yellow">Root for me instead of Dr. Hong Joon Ki.</font>

655
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,664
<font color="yellow">Let's take some
fantastic revenge on her.</font>

656
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:05,277
<font color="yellow">Don't you know this?</font>

657
00:51:05,277 --> 00:51:08,659
<font color="yellow">To face someone fierce,
you have to be fiercer.</font>

658
00:51:25,942 --> 00:51:29,186
<font color="yellow">- Sang Hwa.
- Writer Lee.</font>

659
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:33,092
<font color="yellow">Don't forgive me.</font>

660
00:51:40,003 --> 00:51:42,483
<font color="yellow">Don't ever do something like this again.
It's too dangerous.</font>

661
00:51:42,483 --> 00:51:44,541
<font color="yellow">What would you have done
if something went wrong?</font>

662
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:48,840
<font color="yellow">I didn't do this alone.
Mr. Hae Sung helped me.</font>

663
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,891
<font color="yellow">- Ryu Hae Sung?
<i>- In the past</i></font>

664
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:56,465
<font color="yellow">I was in a similar situation.</font>

665
00:51:56,465 --> 00:51:57,994
<font color="yellow">Back then...</font>

666
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,833
<font color="yellow">I made a foolish choice.</font>

667
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:04,568
<font color="yellow">And after that, I was never at ease.</font>

668
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:09,280
<font color="yellow">Our Writer Lee.</font>

669
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:14,331
<font color="yellow">It will be very hard for her
if she gets betrayed again.</font>

670
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:16,547
<font color="yellow">You don't want that, right?</font>

671
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:18,773
<font color="yellow">I heard from the Assistant Producer</font>

672
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:23,398
<font color="yellow">that Hae Sung told each and every staff
member that we have to trust you.</font>

673
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:27,405
<font color="yellow">And he gave allowances to people
who left good comments on your article.</font>

674
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:38,402
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee, you are on top of
the search engine word list once again.</font>

675
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:40,527
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

676
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:43,536
<font color="yellow"><i>[Writer L's plagiarizing issue.
It was only a small incident.]</i></font>

677
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:57,704
<font color="yellow"><i>Seol, thank you. Thanks to you
I'm out of this mess. I love you.</i></font>

678
00:52:57,704 --> 00:53:00,201
<font color="yellow"><i>I love you too. Cheer up.</i></font>

679
00:53:22,186 --> 00:53:24,481
<font color="yellow"><i>["Universal fool"]</i></font>

680
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:29,398
<font color="yellow">Yes, Writer Lee.
I'm Hae Sung's Manager Oh Chang Seok.</font>

681
00:53:29,398 --> 00:53:33,608
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Is Hae Sung filming now?</font>

682
00:53:33,608 --> 00:53:37,760
<font color="yellow">No, he is at a fishing spot.</font>

683
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,601
<font color="yellow">He said he is going to go fishing,
and he left his phone behind.</font>

684
00:53:40,601 --> 00:53:43,295
<font color="yellow">- A fishing spot?
<i>- Yes.</i></font>

685
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,777
<font color="yellow">He said he has something to think about.</font>

686
00:53:45,777 --> 00:53:47,969
<font color="yellow">Oh, is it something urgent?</font>

687
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:50,750
<font color="yellow">No, it's not...</font>

688
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:09,259
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee, you're here.</font>

689
00:54:11,697 --> 00:54:17,231
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung is having problems with
signing a contract with CEO Choi.</font>

690
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:20,871
<font color="yellow">He goes fishing when he has problems.</font>

691
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,532
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

692
00:54:22,532 --> 00:54:26,155
<font color="yellow">You can go straight this way.</font>

693
00:54:26,155 --> 00:54:27,858
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

694
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:32,715
<font color="yellow">I won't go anywhere near there.</font>

695
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:36,184
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about me, and do...</font>

696
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:43,856
<font color="yellow">I will just go home. Don't worry
about me. You two just go ahead...</font>

697
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:55,246
<font color="yellow">He must be happy.</font>

698
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:04,268
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

699
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,693
<font color="yellow">Cuckoo, cuckoo.</font>

700
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:17,284
<font color="yellow">Cuckoo!</font>

701
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:45,574
<font color="yellow">Ryu Hae Sung.</font>

702
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:29,213
<font color="yellow">Ryu Hae Sung.</font>

703
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:34,385
<font color="yellow">Can't he hear me?</font>

704
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:41,786
<font color="yellow">- Ryu Hae Sung.
- Oh my.</font>

705
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:45,539
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Why are there so many mosquitoes?</font>

706
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,329
<font color="yellow">You scared me--</font>

707
00:56:56,735 --> 00:56:59,407
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

708
00:56:59,407 --> 00:57:01,563
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

709
00:57:01,563 --> 00:57:03,559
<font color="yellow">How did you know I was here?</font>

710
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:10,262
<font color="yellow">I called you, and Chang Seok said...</font>

711
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:14,476
<font color="yellow">So why did you call me?</font>

712
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:18,190
<font color="yellow">Did something happen again?</font>

713
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,297
<font color="yellow">Did CEO Choi try to
get you in trouble again?</font>

714
00:57:26,532 --> 00:57:28,521
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

715
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:32,306
<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

716
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:38,873
<font color="yellow">Thank you for helping Sang Hwa.</font>

717
00:57:38,873 --> 00:57:40,806
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

718
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:42,596
<font color="yellow">I just did what I had to do.</font>

719
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,327
<font color="yellow">Do you like fishing? Since when?</font>

720
00:57:53,327 --> 00:57:55,376
<font color="yellow">It has been several years.</font>

721
00:57:55,376 --> 00:57:57,815
<font color="yellow">I come here when I feel down.</font>

722
00:58:00,262 --> 00:58:02,931
<font color="yellow">I've been to fishing spots
several times.</font>

723
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:05,876
<font color="yellow">- To bury someone.
- What?</font>

724
00:58:05,876 --> 00:58:08,518
<font color="yellow">It's a great place
to have a murder case.</font>

725
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:12,010
<font color="yellow">I have killed my people,
and threw them in the water.</font>

726
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,744
<font color="yellow">- That's what I did.
- You are scary. Why are you doing this?</font>

727
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:18,465
<font color="yellow">Did I do something wrong again?</font>

728
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:21,416
<font color="yellow">I mean that's what I did in my drama.</font>

729
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:24,322
<font color="yellow">Did you not watch my dramas?</font>

730
00:58:24,322 --> 00:58:28,820
<font color="yellow">It's strange. You coming here all of a
sudden and talking about those things.</font>

731
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,608
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you didn't come
all the way here to say thank you.</font>

732
00:58:32,608 --> 00:58:35,362
<font color="yellow">It wasn't because
you wanted to see me so bad.</font>

733
00:58:38,925 --> 00:58:41,619
<font color="yellow">It's Saturday.</font>

734
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,793
<font color="yellow">Saturday?</font>

735
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:49,297
<font color="yellow">You said you are going to do that.
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday...</font>

736
00:58:49,297 --> 00:58:51,237
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

737
00:58:51,237 --> 00:58:54,918
<font color="yellow">Two-timing?</font>

738
00:58:54,918 --> 00:58:58,451
<font color="yellow">So are you saying you are
really going to do that?</font>

739
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,576
<font color="yellow">Since today is my turn, do you mean
you want to go on a date with me?</font>

740
00:59:01,576 --> 00:59:03,590
<font color="yellow">Forget it. I'm leaving.</font>

741
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,695
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you going?
Let's finish our talk.</font>

742
00:59:14,978 --> 00:59:17,617
<font color="yellow">Hey, Lee So Hye.</font>

743
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:19,327
