<font color="yellow">I want to be your number one man.</font>

00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:15,464
<font color="yellow">Are you okay that I am a cancer patient?</font>

00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,051
<font color="yellow">Let's go out.</font>

00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:41,094
<font color="yellow">My ribs were hurting so much,
I couldn't drive.</font>

7
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:44,408
<font color="yellow">Could you give me emergency treatment?</font>

8
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:46,664
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt a lot?</font>

9
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:51,899
<font color="yellow">This area hurts so much that
I couldn't move the steering wheel.</font>

10
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,384
<font color="yellow">Then you should go to a hospital.
A hospital nearby...</font>

11
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:57,490
<font color="yellow">"Universal top star"!</font>

12
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,042
<font color="yellow">If I go anywhere near an ER,
there will be reports of my death.</font>

13
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:04,358
<font color="yellow">Since we have a doctor here,
I can get treated here!</font>

14
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,376
<font color="yellow">Ma'am!</font>

15
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:13,254
<font color="yellow">We're doing work in the building,
so we have no room.</font>

16
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:17,045
<font color="yellow">It's cool out here,
so you two can sleep here.</font>

17
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:23,475
<font color="yellow">Yes, that will be nice.
It will feel like camping!</font>

18
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:29,293
<font color="yellow">A real man likes sleeping outdoors.
I have no reason to not like it either.</font>

19
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:32,864
<font color="yellow">- Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for you?
- It's an honor for me!</font>

20
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,450
<font color="yellow">I get to sleep
next to a famous celebrity.</font>

21
00:01:37,192 --> 00:01:38,804
<font color="yellow">I don't have to worry
about emergency situations</font>

22
00:01:38,804 --> 00:01:40,415
<font color="yellow">with a doctor next to me,
so I like it too.</font>

23
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,412
<font color="yellow">All right, get some rest.</font>

24
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:45,784
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

25
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,712
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight, both of you.</font>

26
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:09,544
<font color="yellow"><i>The light is on in your room.</i></font>

27
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:12,762
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't work too late.
You should go to bed soon.</i></font>

28

<font color="yellow"><i>Do you remember the star we saw earlier?</i></font>

29
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:32,718
<font color="yellow"><i>You're not replying back?
Did you fall asleep with the lights on?</i></font>

30
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:35,945
<font color="yellow"><i>There is also a big star right here.
It's me, the universal top star! LOL</i></font>

31
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,133
<font color="yellow"><i>The stars are very bright here.
Just like a starry night in Uyuni.</i></font>

32
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:40,751
<font color="yellow"><i>Lee So Hye! You have to see mine first!
Reply to me first! You must!</i></font>

33
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,782
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,395
<font color="yellow">I have to write the script, but the
sound of your messages is annoying.</font>

35
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:13,270
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say,
just say it and go to bed now. Please?</font>

36
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,439
<font color="yellow">Oh, it was disturbing you. I'm sorry.</font>

37
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,006
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you need ideas for the script.
Should I help you?</font>

38
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,758
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font>

39
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,015
<font color="yellow">Don't work too hard. Go to bed soon.</font>

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,492
<font color="yellow">You must be really tired
from watching the stars with me earlier.</font>

41
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:33,814
<font color="yellow">Go to bed soon.</font>

42
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,985
<font color="yellow">Both of you should go to bed, too.</font>

43
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,117
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight.</font>

44
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,562
<font color="yellow">Sleep tight.</font>

45
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,895
<font color="yellow">Sweet dreams.</font>

46
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:53,104
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll turn off the light now.</font>

47
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:55,736
<font color="yellow">- Dream about me.
- Be careful.</font>

48
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,657
<font color="yellow">So this is how it feels
to be loved by two men.</font>

49
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:11,024
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

50
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:13,658
<font color="yellow">I wish it had happened sooner.</font>

51
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,913
<font color="yellow">Why after getting a cancer...</font>

52
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:20,672
<font color="yellow">By the way,
will Ryu Hae Sung be all right?</font>

53
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,596
<font color="yellow">He can't stand mosquitoes.</font>

54
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:45,579
<font color="yellow">- Where do you think you're going?
- To the bathroom.</font>

55
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,867
<font color="yellow">Let's go together then.</font>

56
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:51,100
<font color="yellow">You'll be in big trouble if you stumble
into another room by mistake.</font>

57
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,620
<font color="yellow">That won't happen.</font>

58
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,281
<font color="yellow">All of the doors look similar here</font>

59
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:57,673
<font color="yellow">so you could wake someone up
and disturb her.</font>

60
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,680
<font color="yellow">Sure, let's go together then.</font>

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,029
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

62
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:18,007
<font color="yellow">- He was standing guard all night.
- Standing guard?</font>

63
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:21,593
<font color="yellow">He kept his eyes wide open and watched
me in case I went to your room.</font>

64
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:22,934
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

65
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:30,357
<font color="yellow">- Should we go ahead and go for a walk?
- Let's do that.</font>

66
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:42,274
<font color="yellow">My goodness, wake up! Wake up!</font>

67
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,951
<font color="yellow">- Another visitor came from Seoul!
- What visitor...</font>

68
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:47,853
<font color="yellow">President Choi sent me here.</font>

69
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:49,896
<font color="yellow">Mr. Oh Chang Seok got into some trouble.</font>

70
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:54,848
<font color="yellow">Oh Chang Seok...
Oh Chang Seok...</font>

71
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,021
<font color="yellow">- My manager?
- Yes.</font>

72
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:01,228
<font color="yellow">He's at the police station.
For embezzlement and theft.</font>

73
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:05,394
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

74
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,620
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

75
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:19,870
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Where are you now?</font>

76
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,418
<font color="yellow">- I came out for a walk.
- With whom?</font>

77
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:24,773
<font color="yellow">With that Hong Joon Ki?</font>

78
00:06:26,048 --> 00:06:27,136
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

79
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:33,105
<font color="yellow">I have urgent business,
so I need to go back.</font>

80
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,113
<font color="yellow">- Don't say anything stupid.
- What did you say?</font>

81
00:06:37,113 --> 00:06:39,338
<font color="yellow">What I mean is...</font>

82
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:43,692
<font color="yellow"><i>Even if Dr. Hong asks you out,
don't give him an answer.</i></font>

83
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:44,899
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

84
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,742
<font color="yellow">You're in a hurry, so you should go.
I'm hanging up now.</font>

85
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:56,182
<font color="yellow">- Is Mr. Ryu Hae Sung leaving now?
- Yes, something urgent came up.</font>

86
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,601
<font color="yellow">But he said he couldn't drive.
Is he okay now?</font>

87
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,519
<font color="yellow">- So Hye.
- Yes?</font>

88
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,439
<font color="yellow">You like Mr. Ryu Hae Sung, don't you?</font>

89
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,678
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

90
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:18,237
<font color="yellow">I guess I should just be your guy friend.</font>

91
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,355
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I like number two as well.</font>

92
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:25,670
<font color="yellow">Since you want 3,000 men,
there will be 2,998 men after me.</font>

93
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,050
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

94
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:31,704
<font color="yellow">- You're very cool about it.
- It's my survival strategy.</font>

95
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:36,406
<font color="yellow">I'm also a special man who has to
live his life short and sweet.</font>

96
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,821
<font color="yellow">It's obvious that I'll be
gallantly dumped.</font>

97
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,860
<font color="yellow">So I should attack and retreat quickly
in cases like this.</font>

98
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,007
<font color="yellow">So you should confess to him like I did.</font>

99
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:55,512
<font color="yellow">That you like him. That you have cancer.</font>

100
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,120
<font color="yellow">"Is that okay with you?"</font>

101
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,553
<font color="yellow">Isn't it selfish greed?</font>

102
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:06,557
<font color="yellow">Then if something goes wrong with me</font>

103
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:09,351
<font color="yellow">it will leave a big scar
on the surviving person.</font>

104
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:11,538
<font color="yellow">We're in no situation
to think about other people.</font>

105
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,634
<font color="yellow">We have no time to worry.</font>

106
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,399
<font color="yellow">Act on it first.</font>

107
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,425
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't want a cancer patient</font>

108
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:19,451
<font color="yellow">you have number two right here
ready for you.</font>

109
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,697
<font color="yellow">Have you always been
this eloquent a speaker?</font>

110
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:27,372
<font color="yellow">Don't you know me?</font>

111
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:30,129
<font color="yellow">My specialty is giving dating advice.</font>

112
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,894
<font color="yellow">In your case,
you should write your bucket list first.</font>

113
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:42,488
<font color="yellow">A bucket list?</font>

114
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:47,931
<font color="yellow">Not a grand plan, but a detailed plan
with trivial, ordinary stuff.</font>

115
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,620
<font color="yellow">If you plan for about a year</font>

116
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,312
<font color="yellow">your goal will become clear
and you will be motivated.</font>

117
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,058
<font color="yellow">One year...</font>

118
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,118
<font color="yellow">If I participate
in the clinical treatment</font>

119
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:01,595
<font color="yellow">would I be able to live for a year?</font>

120
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,312
<font color="yellow">You could live for over five years,
just like me!</font>

121
00:09:07,811 --> 00:09:12,554
<font color="yellow">Before the clinical treatment, we have
to run some tests and procedures.</font>

122
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:16,445
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you come back with me?
- Okay, I will.</font>

123
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:19,749
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for everything.</font>

124
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,285
<font color="yellow">Please remember number two!</font>

125
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:27,577
<font color="yellow">I will always be loyal to the Queen!</font>

126
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:30,811
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why did I... Really...</font>

127
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,913
<font color="yellow">This brother...</font>

128
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,455
<font color="yellow">Please stop!</font>

129
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:40,764
<font color="yellow">You didn't mean to?</font>

130
00:09:40,764 --> 00:09:43,099
<font color="yellow">You should've told me
if you needed money!</font>

131
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:47,974
<font color="yellow">I didn't want to trouble you every time,
as someone older than you.</font>

132
00:09:47,974 --> 00:09:52,080
<font color="yellow">I had something urgent in my family, so
I meant to use the money and pay it back.</font>

133
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,010
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

134
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,653
<font color="yellow">If you were going to steal the money,
you should've done it right!</font>

135
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:01,058
<font color="yellow">He was the spy for President Choi.
That sly chef!</font>

136
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:05,173
<font color="yellow">He was the one who told on
every detail that time.</font>

137
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:07,986
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you?
I said I didn't say anything!</font>

138
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,894
<font color="yellow">You came?</font>

139
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:30,336
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to take it this far?
What the heck is this?</font>

140
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,812
<font color="yellow">- Get him out quickly.
- What are you talking about?</font>

141
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:36,155
<font color="yellow">It is the rule to be punished
if he did something wrong.</font>

142
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:37,479
<font color="yellow">Rule?</font>

143
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,246
<font color="yellow">Then there is no reason for me
to go to China either.</font>

144
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,628
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want. I'm leaving.</font>

145
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:45,442
<font color="yellow">Get on the plane.</font>

146
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,004
<font color="yellow">Then I'll get him out.</font>

147
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,184
<font color="yellow">Get him out first.

<font color="yellow">Did you come after the shoot?</font>

293
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:04,240
<font color="yellow">I came here because I missed you.</font>

294
00:28:05,665 --> 00:28:08,690
<font color="yellow">All right, I'm glad you came.</font>

295
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:13,358
<font color="yellow">My baby, I'm glad you came...</font>

296
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:18,260
<font color="yellow">Grandma...</font>

297
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:22,178
<font color="yellow">Do you remember when we met
for the first time?</font>

298
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,328
<font color="yellow">I told you at the time...</font>

299
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,205
<font color="yellow">that I had met someone
I wanted to marry.</font>

300
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:34,071
<font color="yellow">After you saw her picture</font>

301
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:37,304
<font color="yellow">you said she looked exactly like my mom.</font>

302
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,236
<font color="yellow">At the time...</font>

303
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:47,203
<font color="yellow">Really...</font>

304
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,721
<font color="yellow">When I was so lonely,
without anyone under the sky...</font>

305
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:59,932
<font color="yellow">she took my side.</font>

306
00:29:02,154 --> 00:29:05,359
<font color="yellow">I finally got to meet her again
after 12 years...</font>

307
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,310
<font color="yellow">and I really wanted to grab on to her.</font>

308
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,909
<font color="yellow">But she doesn't want me.</font>

309
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,375
<font color="yellow">She told me not to linger around.</font>

310
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:20,632
<font color="yellow">Not to linger around...</font>

311
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:28,670
<font color="yellow">I was speechless.
She told me not to linger around...</font>

312
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:32,903
<font color="yellow">I said I was really sorry...</font>

313
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,220
<font color="yellow">But she doesn't want me.</font>

314
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,980
<font color="yellow">She likes some other man.</font>

315
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,057
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

316
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:17,957
<font color="yellow">Where did he go? Chang Seok!</font>

I'm leaving.</i></font>

00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,613
<font color="yellow"><i>Thank you for everything.
Shameful Chang Seok.</i></font>

320
00:30:45,054 --> 00:30:47,449
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

321
00:31:08,097 --> 00:31:11,287
<font color="yellow">What's with this rain?
It's almost midnight.</font>

322
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,272
<font color="yellow">- Honey, I'm hungry.
- You're hungry?</font>

323
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:17,538
<font color="yellow">- Let's go for a plate of grilled fish?
- With soju!</font>

324
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:19,401
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye!</font>

326
00:31:22,372 --> 00:31:24,666
<font color="yellow">What is that? Isn't that a person?</font>

327
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,383
<font color="yellow">Oh my, he's drinking over there.</font>

328
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:29,688
<font color="yellow">Is that your friend?</font>

329
00:31:31,002 --> 00:31:32,585
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Hae Sung?</font>

330
00:31:32,585 --> 00:31:35,089
<font color="yellow">Oh my. It's you, Hae Sung!</font>

331
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,665
<font color="yellow">- Hey, Jo Mi Sun!
- Hey!</font>

332
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:44,480
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- I finally found you!</font>

333
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,682
<font color="yellow">I asked to go to a lettuce farm,
but he couldn't find this place.</font>

334
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:53,740
<font color="yellow">But what brings you here?
All wet from the rain this late!</font>

335
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,672
<font color="yellow">Your alcohol breath!</font>

336
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:59,027
<font color="yellow">- Mi Sun.
- What? What's wrong?</font>

337
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,875
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye...</font>

338
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,232
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

339
00:32:02,232 --> 00:32:06,369
<font color="yellow">- So Hye...
- So... What about So Hye?</font>

340
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:10,069
<font color="yellow">So Hye! So Hye...</font>

341
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:13,412
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey!</font>

342
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:15,935
<font color="yellow">Honey, help him stand.
Oh my. Hey!</font>

343
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:17,470
<font color="yellow">- Honey, let's go.
- My goodness.</font>

344
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,448
<font color="yellow">Wake up! Hey, Ryu Hae Sung!</font>

345
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:21,175
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What do we do, Honey?</font>

346
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:24,980
<font color="yellow">What? Her blood type is O?
That's all you got?</font>

347
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,065
<font color="yellow">That's enough. What more do you need
for a person to love another person?</font>

348
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:29,941
<font color="yellow">Is she blocking you
because she thinks you're</font>

349
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:31,816
<font color="yellow">an unemployed man
living in a dorm room?</font>

350
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,807
<font color="yellow">- She's not like that.
- How can you say that?</font>

351
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:36,586
<font color="yellow">Just tell her that you passed the bar
exam with the highest score.</font>

352
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:40,318
<font color="yellow">- She doesn't like lawyers.
- What? Why doesn't she like lawyers?</font>

353
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,027
<font color="yellow">- Is she an ex-convict, by any chance?
- What?</font>

354
00:32:44,027 --> 00:32:46,405
<font color="yellow">Then why doesn't she like lawyers?
Could she be a judge?</font>

355
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:50,049
<font color="yellow">Or maybe she's a client whose money
was taken by her lawyer?</font>

356
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,451
<font color="yellow">Or, she's a wife of a pervert lawyer?</font>

357
00:32:52,451 --> 00:32:53,676
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

358
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:58,335
<font color="yellow">This is a topic for a drama! A mystery
woman with twists and turns...</font>

359
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:02,814
<font color="yellow">- I'm leaving.
- Hey, wait for me!</font>

360
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:06,526
<font color="yellow">Of course she's a writer.</font>

361
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:09,638
<font color="yellow">A married woman? Such nonsense!</font>

362
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,718
<font color="yellow">- Welcome back, Mother.
- Take this.</font>

363
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,633
<font color="yellow">Abalones and tile fish.</font>

364
00:33:15,633 --> 00:33:20,267
<font color="yellow">- Did you have a good time?
- Yes, I was treated very well.</font>

365
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,958
<font color="yellow">Clean them
and make something with them soon.</font>

366
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,096
<font color="yellow">- I'm hungry.
- Yes, Mother.</font>

367
00:33:26,096 --> 00:33:27,396
<font color="yellow"><i>Mother!</i></font>

368
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:29,586
<font color="yellow">You left this.</font>

369
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,809
<font color="yellow">Oh, you were home!</font>

370
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,257
<font color="yellow">Come in!
I'll be disappointed if you leave.</font>

371
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,776
<font color="yellow">I have to go
because I have a meeting later...</font>

372
00:33:36,776 --> 00:33:39,780
<font color="yellow">Then I will have a quick breakfast.</font>

373
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,493
<font color="yellow">- Come in, please.
- Yes, you should come in.</font>

374
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:43,538
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

375
00:34:02,897 --> 00:34:07,758
<font color="yellow">Seol, even when you're in a hurry,
you should put garnish on steamed fish.</font>

376
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:10,688
<font color="yellow">What lowly manner is this
in front of a guest?</font>

377
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:14,637
<font color="yellow">It's an equivalent of someone
sitting outside naked.</font>

378
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:18,097
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, I will make it again.
- All right.</font>

379
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,927
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Mother, I'm not a guest.</font>

380
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,237
<font color="yellow">She's right. Let's eat, we're hungry.</font>

381
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:27,577
<font color="yellow">- Be careful going forward.
- Yes.</font>

382
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:32,349
<font color="yellow">Hey! Oh my.</font>

383
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,893
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I'm sorry.</font>

384
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,208
<font color="yellow">My late husband had a similar problem...</font>

385
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:44,724
<font color="yellow">so my children don't know how
to be careful at the table.</font>

386
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:48,311
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it.
He should relieve the gas right away.</font>

387
00:34:48,311 --> 00:34:50,246
<font color="yellow">You can't stop
the physiological reaction.</font>

388
00:34:50,246 --> 00:34:54,188
<font color="yellow">If the poisonous gas is absorbed
into the blood stream...</font>

389
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,954
<font color="yellow">He'd be in big trouble.</font>

390
00:34:55,954 --> 00:34:59,177
<font color="yellow">Passing gas is like detoxing.</font>

391
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:05,367
<font color="yellow">Should I also try detoxing so that
Attorney Choi doesn't feel embarrassed?</font>

392
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:15,916
<font color="yellow">It's like we're a real family!</font>

393
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,994
<font color="yellow">It's very hard to be so down to earth
at your status.</font>

394
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:22,739
<font color="yellow">Should we register you
as a family member now?</font>

395
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,047
<font color="yellow">Mother, you haven't done that yet?</font>

396
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:29,001
<font color="yellow">I already changed my name to Choi Mi Do.</font>

397
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:37,476
<font color="yellow">You should stop working and eat with us.
You won't even get to taste anything.</font>

398
00:35:37,476 --> 00:35:40,293
<font color="yellow">If you cook and smell the food,
your appetite goes away.</font>

399
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,931
<font color="yellow">She can eat later.</font>

400
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:48,311
<font color="yellow">This is for you.
Save it and have it later.</font>

401
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:51,329
<font color="yellow">Jin Tae, what are you doing
in front of a guest?</font>

402
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,795
<font color="yellow">Like an idiot...</font>

403
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:55,271
<font color="yellow">This is why I like Attorney Choi.</font>

404
00:35:55,271 --> 00:35:57,505
<font color="yellow">He is considerate and warm.</font>

405
00:35:59,344 --> 00:36:02,659
<font color="yellow">You must be happy to get
so much love from your husband.</font>

406
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:07,871
<font color="yellow">I said leave it! It's yours.</font>

407
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:10,427
<font color="yellow">Take it away before we finish them.</font>

408
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:17,206
<font color="yellow">It's okay.
I have to go visit my mom today.</font>

409
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:18,793
<font color="yellow">I don't have time to eat.</font>

410
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:22,123
<font color="yellow">- Is her mother sick?
- She is.</font>

411
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:24,923
<font color="yellow">We are taking care of her
in a nursing home.</font>

412
00:36:24,923 --> 00:36:28,588
<font color="yellow">Of course, you have big hearts.</font>

413
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:32,277
<font color="yellow">Is there any family that takes care
of the in-laws these days?</font>

414
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:35,516
<font color="yellow">Is that right?
My daughter-in-law is also my family.</font>

415
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:38,835
<font color="yellow">So of course I should do what's right
as a human being.</font>

416
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,891
<font color="yellow">You must be very worried.</font>

417
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,210
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

418
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:46,755
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

419
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,465
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

420
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:52,137
<font color="yellow">The script for Episode 11 is already out?</font>

421
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:55,753
<font color="yellow">There is something strange.
Check on Lee So Hye.</font>

422
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:58,677
<font color="yellow">What writer works so hard to hand
over the script before it airs?</font>

423
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:00,257
<font color="yellow">It's not even pre-recorded.</font>

424
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:02,567
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there is something fishy.
Find out what it is.</font>

425
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:03,900
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

426
00:37:07,094 --> 00:37:08,402
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

427
00:37:08,402 --> 00:37:12,112
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm packing for Mom...</font>

428
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,016
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

429
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:17,518
<font color="yellow">Why are you packing so much?</font>

430
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,766
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

431
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:26,574
<font color="yellow">You're having a feast.</font>

432
00:37:26,574 --> 00:37:29,867
<font color="yellow">Mom! Mom!</font>

433
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:33,922
<font color="yellow">My ears are blowing up! What's going on?</font>

434
00:37:33,922 --> 00:37:37,458
<font color="yellow">Look at this. She's about to pull out
the main column of this house.</font>

435
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:40,487
<font color="yellow">Isn't this pickled pollack?</font>

436
00:37:40,487 --> 00:37:43,260
<font color="yellow">Didn't you tell me the other day</font>

437
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,034
<font color="yellow">"Mother, we're all out
of pickled pollack"?</font>

438
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:49,969
<font color="yellow">My my...
this is the expensive brined abalone!</font>

439
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:57,617
<font color="yellow">I packed a little from the leftovers
as we were pickling a new batch...</font>

440
00:37:57,617 --> 00:37:58,692
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh.</font>

441
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:00,822
<font color="yellow">You have no fear.</font>

442
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:05,556
<font color="yellow">- Give me your wallet.
- Pardon? Why...</font>

443
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:11,030
<font color="yellow">I knew it.</font>

444
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,492
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

445
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,780
<font color="yellow">Jin Tae gave it to me.</font>

446
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:20,244
<font color="yellow">What an idiot.
He acts like a complete idiot!</font>

447
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:26,702
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

448
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:28,228
<font color="yellow">It's my household.</font>

449
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:31,942
<font color="yellow">Without my permission, you cannot take
even one grain of rice over the wall.</font>

450
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,326
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

451
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:36,097
<font color="yellow">I will be the one giving anything
and throwing away anything.</font>

452
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:39,340
<font color="yellow">How dare you
with your uneducated, lowly behavior!</font>

453
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:43,148
<font color="yellow">I didn't know about
the leaks in my house.</font>

454
00:38:43,148 --> 00:38:46,494
<font color="yellow">And I was only worried about the price
level and the national economy!</font>

455
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:47,664
<font color="yellow">My my...</font>

456
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:50,253
<font color="yellow">Mom, your blood pressure will go up.
Let's get out of here.</font>

457
00:38:50,253 --> 00:38:53,041
<font color="yellow">How could such a thing...</font>

458
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,148
<font color="yellow">She's so-called my daughter-in-law...</font>

459
00:38:56,449 --> 00:39:00,579
<font color="yellow">Leave everything.
Before you get another word.</font>

460
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:05,114
<font color="yellow">Mom! Let's go to a department store!</font>

461
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,344
<font color="yellow">It's like new. I haven't worn it at all.</font>

462
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:26,164
<font color="yellow">Please give me a good price.</font>

463
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,019
<font color="yellow"><i>Mr. Younger Brother,
are you at the dorm?</i></font>

464
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:51,940
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes!</i></font>

465
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,382
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

466
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:03,197
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Older Sister!
- Can I use the kitchen here?</font>

467
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:04,543
<font color="yellow">The kitchen?</font>

468
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:08,385
<font color="yellow">I have no place to cook.
I'll give you some too.</font>

469
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,409
<font color="yellow">You're a really great cook.</font>

470
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:18,592
<font color="yellow">- Share it with your friends.
- Thank you.</font>

471
00:40:18,592 --> 00:40:22,628
<font color="yellow">- Aren't you going to eat with us?
- I have somewhere to go in a hurry.</font>

472
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:27,880
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

473
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,387
<font color="yellow">- Sis...
- I'm fine.</font>

474
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:52,740
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Enjoy the food.</font>

475
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,820
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

476
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:58,543
<font color="yellow">Be careful out there!</font>

00:41:12,688 --> 00:41:14,838
<font color="yellow">Ms. Older Sister...</font>

479
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:26,628
<font color="yellow">Her name is Baek Seol?</font>

480
00:41:26,628 --> 00:41:29,242
<font color="yellow">She has a beautiful name. Baek Seol?</font>

481
00:41:29,242 --> 00:41:31,989
<font color="yellow">She's gorgeous in the picture.</font>

482
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,023
<font color="yellow">Really...</font>

483
00:41:36,139 --> 00:41:37,360
<font color="yellow">81?</font>

484
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,751
<font color="yellow">She was born in 1981?</font>

485
00:41:42,811 --> 00:41:45,621
<font color="yellow">I'm still hung over,
so I really can't eat.</font>

486
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:49,103
<font color="yellow">- Eat. You have to eat to wake up!
- Stop.</font>

487
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:55,550
<font color="yellow">This...</font>

488
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,717
<font color="yellow">It's really good! Awesome!</font>

489
00:41:57,717 --> 00:42:01,521
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't worry.
I thought about it all night.</font>

490
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:03,713
<font color="yellow">So Hye doesn't have a man.
I'm sure of it.</font>

491
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:06,211
<font color="yellow">We hung out together
all day a few days ago.</font>

492
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:08,719
<font color="yellow">I kept telling her to date a man,
then she said this to me.</font>

493
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,710
<font color="yellow">"Do I go on a date by myself?
I need a good man to go on a date with."</font>

494
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,326
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

495
00:42:14,326 --> 00:42:16,735
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure?
- I'm sure!</font>

496
00:42:16,735 --> 00:42:19,632
<font color="yellow">She's playing hard to get to get over
the anger she had for you from the past.</font>

497
00:42:19,632 --> 00:42:22,353
<font color="yellow">I'm an expert
in noticing things like that.</font>

498
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:24,139
<font color="yellow">Here, ah!</font>

499
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:25,786
<font color="yellow">Here, here.</font>

500
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:29,385
<font color="yellow">I'll make one for him.</font>

501
00:42:29,385 --> 00:42:31,159
<font color="yellow">You're being jealous!</font>

502
00:42:34,423 --> 00:42:35,782
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye, really...</font>

503
00:42:35,782 --> 00:42:38,101
<font color="yellow">- You're sure?
- I said I am!</font>

504
00:42:38,101 --> 00:42:43,958
<font color="yellow">I'm so glad I came here! I will put your
lettuce on my social media every day.</font>

505
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:46,989
<font color="yellow">I am the spokesperson of your lettuce
starting today!</font>

506
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:51,652
<font color="yellow">My friend!</font>

507
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,027
<font color="yellow">Wait!</font>

508
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:57,681
<font color="yellow">But why did she get Brazilian waxing?</font>

509
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,679
<font color="yellow">What? Bra...</font>

510
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:04,056
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

511
00:43:04,056 --> 00:43:05,672
<font color="yellow">She got waxing done?</font>

512
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:08,818
<font color="yellow">- When?
- A few days ago.</font>

513
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:14,552
<font color="yellow">Never mind. She could've been getting
ready ahead of a date with you.</font>

514
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:17,110
<font color="yellow">What if it's not me? If it's not me...</font>

515
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,358
<font color="yellow">- Did she get it done for him?
- She didn't...</font>

516
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,038
<font color="yellow">- But let's make this clear.
- What?</font>

517
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:29,260
<font color="yellow">Let's say So Hye likes another guy.
And she got waxing done for him.</font>

518
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,865
<font color="yellow">Then I can't help you. I can't help it
even if you're disappointed.</font>

519
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:34,672
<font color="yellow">No matter what kind of universal top star
you are, So Hye comes first to me.</font>

520
00:43:34,672 --> 00:43:38,965
<font color="yellow">One more thing. Let's say So Hye flirts
with that guy and it doesn't go well.</font>

521
00:43:38,965 --> 00:43:40,248
<font color="yellow">Will you make a big deal out of it?</font>

522
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:42,528
<font color="yellow">- Then I can't help you.
- Hey!</font>

523
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:47,547
<font color="yellow">I used to live in America!
I'm a cool guy, American style. Okay?</font>

524
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:50,320
<font color="yellow">Okay! Let's do this then.</font>

525
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,885
<font color="yellow">Let's have So Hye over and
analyze the situation first.</font>

526
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:55,306
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
- Okay, I like that.</font>

527
00:43:55,306 --> 00:43:57,775
<font color="yellow">Bravo, Jo Mi Sun! You're the best!</font>

528
00:44:00,045 --> 00:44:02,811
<font color="yellow">- Take them all together.
- Yes.</font>

529
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,686
<font color="yellow">Do you not have a guardian?</font>

530
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,983
<font color="yellow">You will feel dizzy when you wake up
from anesthesia.</font>

531
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:13,373
<font color="yellow">I'll be fine. I will stay in bed
for a bit before I leave.</font>

532
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:41,576
<font color="yellow"><i>The meeting is running long.
I'll be down as soon as it's over.</i></font>

533
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:45,833
<font color="yellow"><i>Don't worry, and take care of your work.</i></font>

534
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:54,606
<font color="yellow"><i>[MI SUN]</i></font>

535
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:56,528
<font color="yellow">Mi Sun...</font>

536
00:44:58,648 --> 00:44:59,998
<font color="yellow">This evening?</font>

537
00:45:01,146 --> 00:45:02,559
<font color="yellow">What secret?</font>

538
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:06,780
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you, too.</font>

539
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,856
<font color="yellow">Tell Seol to come as well
if she can make it.</font>

540
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:11,452
<font color="yellow">Ms. Lee So Hye, please come in.</font>

541
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:13,204
<font color="yellow">See you later!</font>

542
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,927
<font color="yellow">It's really delicious.</font>

543
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,264
<font color="yellow">Sis, will you
give me this again tomorrow?</font>

544
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,422
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

545
00:45:34,422 --> 00:45:37,606
<font color="yellow">Your nurse will give it to you tomorrow.</font>

546
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:41,146
<font color="yellow">My daughter married into a rich family.</font>

547
00:45:41,146 --> 00:45:45,010
<font color="yellow">- Her husband is a lawyer.
- I see.</font>

548
00:45:50,061 --> 00:45:52,860
<font color="yellow">You're so cute! You're eating very well.</font>

549
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:57,177
<font color="yellow">But she can't have a baby.</font>

550
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:59,266
<font color="yellow">She had a twin brother</font>

551
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:03,353
<font color="yellow">but she's a spiteful wench
who ate up her brother to be born.</font>

552
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:05,001
<font color="yellow">She has a tough fate.</font>

553
00:46:05,001 --> 00:46:07,170
<font color="yellow">That's why she can't have a child.</font>

554
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,800
<font color="yellow">But I'm sure she has a happy life.</font>

555
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,637
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about her. Here.</font>

556
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,684
<font color="yellow">What? Let's have one more bite.</font>

557
00:46:23,449 --> 00:46:27,125
<font color="yellow">Why did you bring things like this?
Your elders would be worried.</font>

558
00:46:28,242 --> 00:46:30,719
<font color="yellow">I should die soon
so that you can be comfortable...</font>

559
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,048
<font color="yellow">How can you say that!</font>

560
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:37,798
<font color="yellow">You have to stay healthy,
so that I can live a good life.</font>

561
00:46:48,297 --> 00:46:51,780
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Why don't you answer your phone?</font>

562
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,858
<font color="yellow"><i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at the nursing home.</font>

563
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:57,606
<font color="yellow">Why did you not take the car
and make Secretary Yang worry?</font>

564
00:46:58,784 --> 00:47:00,846
<font color="yellow"><i>I heard the gist of it
from Secretary Yang.</i></font>

565
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:02,855
<font color="yellow">You should've been careful.</font>

566
00:47:02,855 --> 00:47:04,864
<font color="yellow">You know Mother is sensitive
about the household stuff.</font>

567
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:10,824
<font color="yellow">Take your time
and enjoy the time with your mom.</font>

568
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:16,394
<font color="yellow">Take your time
and enjoy the time with your mom.</font>

569
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:20,958
<font color="yellow">Yes. I will be home late because I am
going to dinner with the colleagues.</font>

570
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:25,494
<font color="yellow">I will tell Mother.</font>

571
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,885
<font color="yellow">- Okay?
<i>- I got it.</i></font>

572
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:31,541
<font color="yellow">What's this?
You're not going to thank me?</font>

573
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,579
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

574
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,137
<font color="yellow">All right. See you at home later.</font>

575
00:47:51,027 --> 00:47:53,010
<font color="yellow">So Hye! So Hye!</font>

576
00:47:58,815 --> 00:48:01,119
<font color="yellow">Me too! Me too!</font>

577
00:48:04,731 --> 00:48:08,402
<font color="yellow">Choi Jin Sook is your sister-in-law?
That witch?</font>

578
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:10,050
<font color="yellow">That says everything.</font>

579
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:13,231
<font color="yellow">If the sister-in-law is like that, I'm
sure the mother-in-law is worse.</font>

580
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:16,400
<font color="yellow">Are you upset?</font>

581
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,163
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
I found out only after I got married.</font>

582
00:48:20,163 --> 00:48:22,467
<font color="yellow">I was going to tell you
before I went to the States...</font>

583
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,206
<font color="yellow">Why would I be upset?</font>

584
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:28,190
<font color="yellow">It's horrible that you're living
with her under the same roof.</font>

585
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:30,952
<font color="yellow">It's bearable.</font>

586
00:48:30,952 --> 00:48:34,722
<font color="yellow">By the way,
she's having someone check on you.</font>

587
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:35,722
<font color="yellow">Check on me? Me?</font>

588
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:37,221
<font color="yellow">Is there something going on?</font>

589
00:48:37,221 --> 00:48:39,000
<font color="yellow">She must be looking for an excuse</font>

590
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,778
<font color="yellow">because she doesn't want
to pay me for the script.</font>

591
00:48:40,778 --> 00:48:42,686
<font color="yellow">Money is everything to her.</font>

592
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,628
<font color="yellow">Be careful! They are scary people.</font>

593
00:48:45,628 --> 00:48:48,045
<font color="yellow">Hey, they should be careful.</font>

594
00:48:48,045 --> 00:48:50,509
<font color="yellow">The three musketeers got together,
so what would we be afraid of?</font>

595
00:48:51,704 --> 00:48:52,945
<font color="yellow">You're right!</font>

596
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:58,936
<font color="yellow">By the way, do you
have a boyfriend, So Hye?</font>

597
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,079
<font color="yellow">- No. Why?
- Right? You don't?</font>

598
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,840
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

599
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,708
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

600
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,510
<font color="yellow">Mi Sun!</font>

601
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:14,969
<font color="yellow">Oh no. What brings Writer Lee here?</font>

602
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,873
<font color="yellow">What a coincidence!</font>

603
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,248
<font color="yellow">Look at me! I was so glad to see you</font>

604
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,623
<font color="yellow">I forgot to tell you
that Hae Sung was coming.</font>

605
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,427
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm the universal top star,
Ryu Hae Sung.</font>

606
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,050
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you.</font>

607
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:28,378
<font color="yellow">My name is Baek Seol.</font>

608
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:32,199
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about last time.
Your car was ruined because of me...</font>

609
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,925
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.
I took care of everything.</font>

610
00:49:39,516 --> 00:49:40,523
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

611
00:49:40,523 --> 00:49:46,018
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung came by a few days ago
because he really enjoyed our lettuce.</font>

612
00:49:46,018 --> 00:49:49,264
<font color="yellow">So I told him to stop by anytime.
And he came back so soon.</font>

613
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:51,521
<font color="yellow">I know, I came back again!</font>

614
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,728
<font color="yellow">Please sit down!
Why are you standing there?</font>

615
00:49:54,728 --> 00:49:56,525
<font color="yellow">I like standing up!</font>

616
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,186
<font color="yellow">- Please!
- It's uncomfortable for me to sit.</font>

617
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:01,286
<font color="yellow">- Come on, have a seat.
- I have to sit down? I have no choice?</font>

618
00:50:04,538 --> 00:50:08,121
<font color="yellow">Oh my. This picture of you two
is a work of art.</font>

619
00:50:08,121 --> 00:50:11,492
<font color="yellow">- Right?
- She's right. You look good together.</font>

620
00:50:14,186 --> 00:50:18,521
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I have been hiding this so
I can make a proper introduction...</font>

621
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:20,612
<font color="yellow">But I got a boyfriend.</font>

622
00:50:20,612 --> 00:50:24,798
<font color="yellow">Really? That's great!
What kind of guy is he?</font>

623
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:28,873
<font color="yellow">He is a doctor who gives
medical advice for my drama.</font>

624
00:50:28,873 --> 00:50:30,813
<font color="yellow">We fell for each other
while we were working.</font>

625
00:50:30,813 --> 00:50:33,556
<font color="yellow">A doctor? A doctor is great.</font>

626
00:50:33,556 --> 00:50:35,860
<font color="yellow">Do you have his number?
Do you have a picture of him?</font>

627
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:42,668
<font color="yellow">Did you make up your mind?
Did you go all the way?</font>

628
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:45,085
<font color="yellow">Of course! I'm so happy these days.</font>

629
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:47,992
<font color="yellow">That's really great.
When will you show him to us?</font>

630
00:50:47,992 --> 00:50:51,215
<font color="yellow">Actually, he gave me a ride here.</font>

631
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:53,663
<font color="yellow">If I knew if it was going to be like
this, I should've brought him.</font>

632
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:56,010
<font color="yellow">- You should've!
- You should call him now.</font>

633
00:51:00,067 --> 00:51:04,222
<font color="yellow">By the way, it's nice that Hae Sung
is hanging out with us!</font>

634
00:51:04,222 --> 00:51:07,750
<font color="yellow">Let's all be friends
and get together once in a while.</font>

635
00:51:11,617 --> 00:51:12,884
<font color="yellow">Friends?</font>

636
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:17,701
<font color="yellow">Friends...</font>

637
00:51:23,943 --> 00:51:28,472
<font color="yellow">By the way, when is Seok Won coming?
I'm really curious how he grew up.</font>

638
00:51:28,472 --> 00:51:30,211
<font color="yellow">- Should I show you his picture?
- Yes!</font>

639
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:35,740
<font color="yellow">He's really good-looking!
So Hye, look at this!</font>

640
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:38,277
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know he's good-looking!</font>

641
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:45,266
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

642
00:51:45,266 --> 00:51:47,728
<font color="yellow">It's so good to see you!</font>

643
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:50,829
<font color="yellow">- Let's get together once a month.
- Yes, let's do that.</font>

644
00:51:50,829 --> 00:51:52,347
<font color="yellow">I'll try.</font>

645
00:51:52,347 --> 00:51:55,978
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Pil, the food was really great.
- I agree.</font>

646
00:51:55,978 --> 00:52:00,628
<font color="yellow">Next time, I'll get a pig.
You have to come back.</font>

647
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:04,393
<font color="yellow">See you again next time!</font>

648
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:07,465
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

649
00:52:08,887 --> 00:52:11,268
<font color="yellow">Get in. I'll take you home.</font>

650
00:52:11,268 --> 00:52:15,409
<font color="yellow">Yes, take Hae Sung's car.
We'll take Seol home.</font>

651
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:19,257
<font color="yellow">Sure. Should we do that?</font>

652
00:52:19,257 --> 00:52:20,699
<font color="yellow">- See you again.
- Okay.</font>

not that she's older?</font>

Ryu Hae Sung likes So Hye, right?</font>

You can tell just by looking at him.</font>

I turned away.</font>

all the time in the script.</font>

01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:25,530
<font color="yellow">How many extras am I supposed to use?</font>

731
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,847
<font color="yellow">A thousand? Two thousand people?</font>

732
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:29,967
<font color="yellow">Then do you know how much it costs
to shoot that one scene?</font>

733
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:31,474
<font color="yellow">It's one, two hundred million won.</font>

734
01:00:31,474 --> 01:00:35,326
<font color="yellow">And the penthouse, the stage, and
a helicopter whenever you like it?</font>

735
01:00:35,326 --> 01:00:36,572
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to fund it?</font>

736
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:39,164
<font color="yellow">Blockbuster.
Don't you know what that means?</font>

737
01:00:39,164 --> 01:00:40,795
<font color="yellow">You said it's a blockbuster.</font>

738
01:00:40,795 --> 01:00:42,764
<font color="yellow">Not in a set. All location shooting.
An impressive scale.</font>

739
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,601
<font color="yellow">That's what you asked for.</font>

740
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:47,679
<font color="yellow">I forgot to tell you this!</font>

741
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,668
<font color="yellow">Sorry. I changed the concept
when we didn't get the investment.</font>

742
01:00:50,668 --> 01:00:53,226
<font color="yellow">Hitman? It's a low-budget drama.</font>

743
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:57,907
<font color="yellow">Since the production condition changed,
you should update the script.</font>

744
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:59,295
<font color="yellow">It's written in the contract.</font>

745
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:03,097
<font color="yellow">"If A requests the script to be adjusted,
B is obligated to adjust it."</font>

746
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:07,373
<font color="yellow">You get paid a lot for the script.
You should earn your keep.</font>

747
01:01:08,411 --> 01:01:12,132
<font color="yellow">Give me a clear guideline.
What do you want me to adjust and how?</font>

748
01:01:14,226 --> 01:01:19,034
<font color="yellow">Achieve explosive ratings
with a minimal budget.</font>

749
01:01:19,034 --> 01:01:20,998
<font color="yellow">Make it obnoxiously interesting.</font>

750
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:23,704
<font color="yellow">A script that requires bundles of money?</font>

751
01:01:24,869 --> 01:01:26,612
<font color="yellow">- I could write that.
- Watch what you say.</font>

752
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:29,775
<font color="yellow">Don't speak with an informal tone.
You're not my boss.</font>

753
01:01:33,182 --> 01:01:35,329
<font color="yellow">Watch how you act, Writer Lee.</font>

754
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,934
<font color="yellow">How can a writer
go to the shooting location</font>

755
01:01:36,934 --> 01:01:38,539
<font color="yellow">and invite an actor to your lodging?</font>

756
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:40,934
<font color="yellow">What if the reporters find out?</font>

757
01:01:40,934 --> 01:01:45,969
<font color="yellow">Act cautious and update the script,
Writer Lee.</font>

758
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:53,909
<font color="yellow">The reason I adjust the script is...</font>

759
01:01:53,909 --> 01:01:56,657
<font color="yellow">for the quality of my script,
not for the flip-flopping producer.</font>

760
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:59,405
<font color="yellow">You should know that.</font>

761
01:01:59,405 --> 01:02:03,764
<font color="yellow">Yes, yes, yes...
I will engrave it in my heart.</font>

762
01:02:21,724 --> 01:02:24,784
<font color="yellow">Director Yoon,
President Choi was just here...</font>

763
01:02:26,427 --> 01:02:29,847
<font color="yellow">What? She said no to the penthouse?</font>

764
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:33,077
<font color="yellow">Then where should we shoot the scenes
of the main character's place?</font>

765
01:02:33,077 --> 01:02:35,362
<font color="yellow">In some low-rent apartment?</font>

766
01:02:39,027 --> 01:02:40,643
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung's house?</font>

767
01:02:40,643 --> 01:02:44,278
<font color="yellow">My goodness.
Who can stop President Choi?</font>

768
01:02:44,278 --> 01:02:47,065
<font color="yellow">What do you think?
This place is good, isn't it?</font>

769
01:02:47,065 --> 01:02:49,711
<font color="yellow">Shoot the scenes of K's penthouse here.</font>

770
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:50,909
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

771
01:02:50,909 --> 01:02:54,048
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're the top in the universe
when it comes to generosity.</font>

772
01:02:54,048 --> 01:02:58,030
<font color="yellow">Your house will be ruined if dozens of
the staff come in with the equipment.</font>

773
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,438
<font color="yellow">It's fine!
Why would I let this place go to waste?</font>

774
01:03:01,438 --> 01:03:04,269
<font color="yellow">The ceiling is high and it's wide.
It's just like a set!</font>

775
01:03:06,371 --> 01:03:09,074
<font color="yellow">Make yourselves at home and
shoot the scenes comfortably!</font>

776
01:03:11,394 --> 01:03:14,208
<font color="yellow">Thank you. It's a difficult decision.</font>

777
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:16,400
<font color="yellow">This is no big deal at all!</font>

778
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,661
<font color="yellow">Isn't this a given for a main actor?</font>

779
01:03:20,523 --> 01:03:23,621
<font color="yellow">Since you're here, you should check
the movement line.</font>

780
01:03:23,621 --> 01:03:24,688
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'll do that.</font>

781
01:03:24,688 --> 01:03:27,675
<font color="yellow">Then we'll go out to scout
the low-budget locations.</font>

782
01:03:27,675 --> 01:03:28,889
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

783
01:03:41,757 --> 01:03:45,467
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with a stylist,
so I have to go.</font>

784
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:51,400
<font color="yellow">Take your time to look around.
If you need to work, feel free.</font>

785
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,077
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

786
01:03:53,077 --> 01:03:56,523
<font color="yellow">Can I just shut the door when I leave?</font>

787
01:03:57,579 --> 01:04:01,985
<font color="yellow">Of course!
Feel free to use anything you need.</font>

788
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:07,329
<font color="yellow">And there are drinks
and fruits in the fridge.</font>

789
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:14,800
<font color="yellow">Then... I'll be back.</font>

790
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,606
<font color="yellow">"I'll be back..."</font>

791
01:05:28,711 --> 01:05:29,972
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

792
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:35,393
<font color="yellow">I was checking the movement
in the script.</font>

793
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:43,724
<font color="yellow">Will you continue to work
with President Choi Jin Sook?</font>

794
01:05:47,038 --> 01:05:50,478
<font color="yellow">I don't know why you let yourself be
dragged around by someone like her.</font>

795
01:05:50,478 --> 01:05:52,981
<font color="yellow">I wonder if you have a reason
you can't say...</font>

796
01:05:54,905 --> 01:05:56,708
<font color="yellow">Why would you be curious about that?</font>

797
01:05:57,809 --> 01:05:59,936
<font color="yellow">You don't like that I'm being
dragged around by President Choi?</font>

798
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:02,320
<font color="yellow">- Of course I don't like it.
- Why?</font>

799
01:06:04,568 --> 01:06:06,675
<font color="yellow">- It's because...
- Because you like me.</font>

800
01:06:08,461 --> 01:06:11,795
<font color="yellow">Because you're worried about me. Right?</font>

801
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:17,887
<font color="yellow">It's a lie
that you're seeing Hong Joon Ki.</font>

802
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:19,204
<font color="yellow">- It's not a lie.
- It's really not?</font>

803
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:21,472
<font color="yellow">Why do you make me repeat myself?</font>

804
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:25,353
<font color="yellow">What are you asking me to do?
Are you telling me to date both of you?</font>

805
01:06:28,134 --> 01:06:31,478
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. Date me too.</font>

806
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:33,001
<font color="yellow">I can't give up on you either.</font>

807
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:35,846
<font color="yellow">But how does it work?</font>

808
01:06:35,846 --> 01:06:37,911
<font color="yellow">Should I divide days with Hong Joon Ki?</font>

809
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,121
<font color="yellow">Monday, Wednesday, Friday, then
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday?</font>

810
01:06:39,121 --> 01:06:41,706
<font color="yellow">But give me Sunday. I should get
four days even if you're dating both.</font>

811
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,025
<font color="yellow">We have history together,
so I should get a higher stake.</font>

812
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:45,934
<font color="yellow">Oh, and I'll take Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday.</font>

813
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,842
<font color="yellow">It's nice to get an overnight
from Saturday.</font>

814
01:06:49,525 --> 01:06:51,280
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

815
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,471
<font color="yellow">Stop it when I tell you to stop it!
You can't handle me!</font>

816
01:06:55,471 --> 01:06:59,114
<font color="yellow">Why can't I?
I'm telling you that I will!</font>

817
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:13,507
<font color="yellow">Do you like me that much?</font>

818
01:07:17,626 --> 01:07:20,396
<font color="yellow">Enough that you're okay
with me dating two men?</font>

819
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:25,552
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'd rather hang on to even one leg
of yours than ending it like this.</font>

820
01:07:29,568 --> 01:07:31,014
<font color="yellow">I see...</font>

821
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:36,534
<font color="yellow">Then, will you sleep with me?</font>
