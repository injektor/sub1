1
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:12,183
Did she get hurt?

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:14,918
Someone call 911.

3
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:28,046
Baek Seol?

4
00:00:28,047 --> 00:00:30,515
Gosh, it is Seol.

5
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:33,219
- Seol!
- Seol. Seol!

6
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,957
Seol! Just a moment please.
Step aside please.

7
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:39,232
Step aside please.

8
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,189
Seol, Seol.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,430
- Oh my.
- It's Seol.

10
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,552
Seol. Wake up, Seol.

11
00:00:45,553 --> 00:00:47,906
By any chance, do you know her?

12
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,599
<i>[Episode 2]</i>

13
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:58,261
<i>[Husband]</i>

14
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:03,951
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

15
00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm Seol's friend Lee So Hye.

16
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:08,706
Seol got in a car accident.

17
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:11,054
What? An accident?

18
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,631
What about my wife?

19
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:14,698
- Did she get hurt a lot?
- I'm not sure.

20
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,284
I will call you back from the hospital.

21
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,391
- So Hye, here.
- Okay.

22
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:22,989
Where are you going? What about me?

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:25,535
- What about my car?
- Call me later.

24
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,508
- Isn't he Ryu Hae Sung?
- It's Ryu Hae Sung.

25
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:44,999
Hello. Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,496
Okay. I will call you back.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,266
You guys must have been very surprised.

28
00:02:02,267 --> 00:02:04,218
It's a relief that she wasn't too hurt.

29
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,572
There must have been something wrong with
her car. It was speeding like crazy.

30
00:02:06,573 --> 00:02:08,256
It could have hit her.

31
00:02:08,257 --> 00:02:13,479
She's not good at driving.
She's a coward.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,142
I told her I'd send her a driver.
But she couldn't wait for that.

33
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:21,493
- Her guardian? Please come in.
- Okay.

34
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:24,700
She's a coward? She used to ride
a motorcycle with one hand.

35
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:28,910
Our Ms. Baek Seol.
She must have been coy.

36
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:30,835
Baek Seol.

37
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:34,192
Seol.

38
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,224
You guys must have been very surprised.

39
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:38,281
I met you guys after so long...
I'm only causing trouble for you guys.

40
00:02:38,282 --> 00:02:40,851
What do you mean, trouble?
It's a relief that you are okay.

41
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:43,285
- Did it hurt a lot?
- I'm okay.

42
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,065
It's a relief that
your pretty face is okay.

43
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,902
- I thought I was going to lose my baby.
- No wonder...

44
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,963
You must be having a late child.

45
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,732
That's not what I meant.

46
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,822
Let's go to her room first.

47
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,606
- We could have just gone home.
- What are you talking about?

48
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,107
You should stay in hospital for few days
and get complete medical examination.

49
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:18,888
You can't get out of
the hospital until we make sure

50
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,158
that you are okay from head to toe.

51
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,809
That's right. Get checked up.

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,679
After effects from traffic accidents
can be scary.

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,435
How sweet. I envy her.

54
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:30,147
My husband said he will get rid of me
if I get sick. So I can't get sick.

55
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:34,881
He wouldn't mean it. What can be
more precious than a wife to a husband?

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,803
You look very tired.
You should get some rest.

57
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:47,041
You guys met after so long.
And we only caused you guys trouble.

58
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:49,704
What do you mean?
We are friends. Don't worry about it.

59
00:03:49,705 --> 00:03:52,803
We should get going then.

60
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:57,480
This fast? Okay, take care.
Call me.

61
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:59,846
We will invite you guys to our house
once she gets discharged.

62
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:02,597
Okay.

63
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:05,548
- I will call you.
- Okay.

64
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:14,844
What's wrong with you?
People might see us.

65
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:17,741
Stop. You are disgusting.
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

66
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:20,216
- How could you say that?
- Get it right.

67
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:23,038
I only remained silent because
I didn't want to be embarrassed.

68
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,288
I was drunk. That was just a part
of my business. I made a mistake.

69
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,080
You know men do that.
Stop it now.

70
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,892
It's one of the few mistakes I've made.
Are you flawless?

71
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,373
You are infertile, and your father has
debt. Your mother is bedridden.

72
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,861
- I endured all of that.
- I can't wear a mask

73
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:38,348
and put on a show like you.

74
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,846
- Don't force me to do something.
- Okay, okay.

75
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,538
Take some rest for a few days.

76
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,730
I will talk to Mother.

77
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:54,911
Secretary Yang. Did you find
a nursing home for Mother-in-law?

78
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,116
Find a place nice and close to Seoul.

79
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,784
And find a good caregiver too.

80
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,093
Okay.

81
00:05:04,393 --> 00:05:07,342
- I will get going. Bye.
- Okay.

82
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,176
- Writer Lee.
- Oh.

83
00:05:15,177 --> 00:05:17,612
Chang Seok.

84
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:27,104
Oh my. Welcome.

85
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:29,168
- You should have just called me.
- You should see it in person

86
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:31,394
and see how serious this is.

87
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:34,144
My friend Baobin.
Doesn't it look horrible?

88
00:05:34,145 --> 00:05:36,264
It needs a complete makeover,
and it's internal organs are ruptured.

89
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,933
Let the insurance company
take care of it.

90
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:39,604
Universal top star.

91
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,454
They write articles on pneumonia when
I cough. Why would I cause that trouble?

92
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:45,179
You go ahead and get
the repair fee from her.

93
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,765
- 16.45 million won.
- What?

94
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,767
I didn't even include the rental fee.

95
00:05:52,768 --> 00:05:55,841
I told you I'm going to
replace the hood too.

96
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,776
- Sir!
- Okay.

97
00:05:57,777 --> 00:06:00,479
- I will take that.
- You have to get that money from her.

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,856
- You are responsible for this.
- Don't worry, I won't run away. Then.

99
00:06:05,857 --> 00:06:08,877
Where are you going?
We need to have an idea meeting.

100
00:06:08,878 --> 00:06:12,075
- What?
- Well. I gave you Hollywood-level ideas.

101
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:14,233
So it's time for you
to show your abilities.

102
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:17,950
Then I will be waiting for a revised
script for a multidimensional

103
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:20,958
romantic melodrama.

104
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:23,948
Baobin...

105
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:39,534
What? "Universal top star?"

106
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,351
You're a universal dummy.

107
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:44,325
Why did he follow me there
and cause an accident?

108
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:48,906
A revised script for a
multidimensional romantic melodrama?

109
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,770
He's not even funny. He won't be
able to handle it even if I write one.

110
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,766
- Hae Sung.
- Hae Sung.

111
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:12,990
- Your name?
- I'm Park Jung Ah.

112
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:14,590
Ms. Park Jung Ah.

113
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,212
I love you.

114
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:23,539
Hitman looks so fun.

115
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,222
Don't miss it. Put it on your SNS.
Spread the word.

116
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,553
Only the main characters will be doing
a script reading today.

117
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:44,233
Did the revised script come out already?

118
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,067
- When is the reading?
- 6 o'clock.

119
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,959
6 o'clock.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,926
Make a reservation at the beauty shop.
To get my hair done and get a message.

121
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,649
And call my stylist and tell her
to bring a fancy outfit for me.

122
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:57,329
Let's show Writer Lee
how fashionable I can be.

123
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,965
Okay.

124
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:12,123
What do you think?
The "Hitman" that is in your mind is

125
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,564
- standing right in front of you, right?
- You prepared a lot.

126
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:23,080
After the script reading, we will also
be having a style concept meeting.

127
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:25,358
- Give him the script.
- Okay.

128
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,989
Wow, it looks fresh.

129
00:08:32,425 --> 00:08:36,586
Well then. Let's focus on
the added mellow scenes.

130
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:40,331
Since those are emotional scenes,
please be focused and be more realistic.

131
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:43,834
Writer Lee, does this mean I will be
acting as two different characters?

132
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:47,108
That's right. It says you look just like
K's first lover.

133
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,099
This will be interesting.

134
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,873
Let's get it together then.

135
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,517
Let's begin.

136
00:08:54,518 --> 00:08:56,041
On a cliff near the seashore.

137
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:59,839
The open car stops. K looks like he
just popped out of a magazine

138
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,642
and gets out of the car.
He stares at something.

139
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,511
Mina is standing at the end of the cliff
and shedding tears.

140
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,671
K gets close to her.

141
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,980
So you did you finally decided to do it?

142
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:16,203
That marriage?

143
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:19,288
Mina cries without response.

144
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:39,301
K starts to tear up,
but he tries to hold it back.

145
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,331
Tear.

146
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:58,812
K cries as he sneers to himself.

147
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:09,922
So this is it? It's the love you
talked about? Is this destiny?

148
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:15,151
- K cries out.
- This isn't it!

149
00:10:15,152 --> 00:10:18,541
That isn't it.

150
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:20,296
What?

151
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:23,849
Well. You should...

152
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,436
You should put more feeling into it.

153
00:10:26,437 --> 00:10:28,983
- Let's keep going.
- Okay.

154
00:10:28,984 --> 00:10:32,134
We will keep going then.

155
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:36,382
Mina looks back at K
with tear-filled eyes.

156
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:40,959
Please leave me.
That's all you can do for me.

157
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,901
No way. Don't go. Stop.

158
00:10:42,902 --> 00:10:46,348
K becomes more emotional.

159
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:48,795
Stop there. Stop. Stop.

160
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:51,594
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!

161
00:10:58,373 --> 00:11:00,661
Oh.

162
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:04,026
I'm sorry. I think I got too emotional.

163
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:05,615
I felt dizzy.

164
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:07,499
I will try again.

165
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,378
Okay.

166
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,796
Let me get into the mood.

167
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,607
I will try.

168
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,422
Stop.

169
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,464
That wasn't the right tone of voice.

170
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,407
Again.

171
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:32,920
Stop. Stop. Stop!

172
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:43,592
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:46,081
I'm sorry. Keep going.

174
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,461
I feel bad, Writer Lee.

175
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:56,176
I want really want to do well.

176
00:11:56,177 --> 00:11:58,873
My partner must be able to support me.

177
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,383
It must be because
it's his first time acting that role.

178
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:02,114
He will improve.

179
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:04,799
I heard he botches a lot of his scenes.

180
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,942
I'm scared.

181
00:12:10,182 --> 00:12:11,750
Really?

182
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:19,805
Gosh, it took two hours
to do a script reading.

183
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:21,498
Aren't you thirsty?

184
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,230
What are you doing?
Are you not going to go? Huh?

185
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:43,181
- Stop.
- What? What did you say?

186
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:48,919
I said stop the car.

187
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,713
What? You can't understand me either
because I don't enunciate?

188
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,551
Stop the car. Stop! Stop!

189
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:59,320
- Stop the car. Stop.
- Hey.

190
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,884
Stop it now!

191
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:07,598
<i>[Patient: Baek Seol]
[Nurse: Lee Yu Jung]</i>

192
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,574
<i>You must have been
very surprised yesterday.</i>

193
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,901
<i>Could you come
visit me before I go home?</i>

194
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:15,243
<i>To be honest, there are a lot of things
I couldn't say yesterday.</i>

195
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,407
<i>I have a lot of things I want to say.</i>

196
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,937
I heard that you had an car accident.
And I just had to come here.

197
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:33,715
Put it there and leave.

198
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:46,523
Yes, I'm here.

199
00:14:46,524 --> 00:14:50,623
I know I'm a bitch and I'm shameless.

200
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:54,026
I dare say I understand
how shocking it must have been for you.

201
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,588
Still.

202
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:00,408
I came here because I'm not the type
of person who runs away from my trouble.

203
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:03,210
Please be generous, and forgive me.
That day...

204
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,494
I drank too much that day.

205
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:10,926
Let's shake it off.

206
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,715
What are you doing?

207
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,329
I came here to apologize to you.
How dare you...

208
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,253
What's up with that attitude?
What's up with that eye?

209
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,982
Are you crazy?

210
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:28,902
You can't even do your job right
as a woman. How dare you...

211
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,943
Are you saying you are his wife?

212
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,136
If you had accepted my apology

213
00:15:33,137 --> 00:15:35,086
you wouldn't have gotten hit.
It would have been very nice.

214
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,547
You didn't see anything that day.
Do you understand me?

215
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:39,792
If you babble about
what happened that day...

216
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:44,262
It won't end with just
a slap in the face.

217
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:46,431
I'm a scary person.

218
00:15:50,018 --> 00:15:51,835
I got too emotional.

219
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:55,652
Let's shake it off.
Let's forget about it.

220
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:57,513
Let's act like grownups.

221
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,623
Then, I hope you get better.

222
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:09,431
Oh, Sir. It must be very hard for you.

223
00:16:09,432 --> 00:16:11,512
- Get better soon.
- Thank you.

224
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:16,032
- Our cute young lady. Get better soon.
- Okay.

225
00:16:16,033 --> 00:16:18,401
Please take care.

226
00:16:18,402 --> 00:16:20,022
How pretty.

227
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:03,653
<i>That isn't it.</i>

228
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:07,764
<i>My partner must be able to support me.
He botches a lot of his scenes.</i>

229
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,652
<i>Since you don't know where you stand</i>

230
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,540
<i>people call you "acting impotent."</i>

231
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,913
Hae Sung.

232
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,957
CEO Choi keeps on calling me to
ask when you will be there.

233
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,841
Are you not going?

234
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:42,315
- Why... Why are you doing this?
- "Why are you doing this?"

235
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:44,904
What? What did I do?

236
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:49,479
No... It's because you are upset...

237
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,456
I'm not upset at all.

238
00:17:51,457 --> 00:17:53,381
I was acting just now.

239
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:56,082
What do you think? Do you still think
I'm "foot acting"?

240
00:18:00,076 --> 00:18:03,171
Gosh, I can't understand this.

241
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:06,290
Foot acting... Oh my.

242
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,796
That was a fast recovery.

243
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,840
That's an amazing victory of mind.
It's scary.

244
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:16,000
Wow.

245
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:20,332
Writer Kim.

246
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:23,947
Why are you trying to achieve
self-realization in my company?

247
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,901
Is this a script, or a poop?

248
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:28,567
You are talking too harshly.

249
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:33,767
I have a right to write
what I want to write.

250
00:18:33,768 --> 00:18:36,237
Really? Then write whatever
you want to write.

251
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:38,229
I will file a lawsuit then.

252
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,274
See you in court.

253
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:57,994
Oh, you are here.

254
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:00,811
You love going to court.

255
00:19:00,812 --> 00:19:03,231
Filing lawsuits must be fun.

256
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,382
Do you know what your nickname is?

257
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,670
I know. Ms. Lawsuit.

258
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,422
Isn't that nice? It's funny.

259
00:19:12,423 --> 00:19:14,569
I've made a lot of money for you.

260
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,773
You should keep your dignity.

261
00:19:16,774 --> 00:19:21,874
I heard you had a script reading.
Did Lee So Hye act up again?

262
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,240
Tell me if you don't like her.

263
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:26,607
I have tons of other writers
who could replace her.

264
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,497
- Stop it please.
- What?

265
00:19:28,498 --> 00:19:31,786
I finally found an interesting script.
Don't get me distracted.

266
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,661
And don't try to add in those lame PPL.

267
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:36,533
What is wrong with you?
You are not a amateur.

268
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:40,046
- Producing a drama is also a business.
- Use something else to do your business.

269
00:19:40,047 --> 00:19:43,011
If you cause a hassle about replacing
the producer or the writer again...

270
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:47,205
I'm not going to do any of my abroad
schedule next year. I'll disappear.

271
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,055
I heard you had a car accident.

272
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:51,934
You have Chang Seok.
Why did you drive yourself?

273
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,597
I took care of that with my money.
So don't worry about that.

274
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:58,444
I heard you were with Lee So Hye.

275
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,417
My nickname is Ms. Lawsuit.
Why do you think I got that name?

276
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,548
What?
Do you still have feelings for her?

277
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:16,104
Are you writing a book too?

278
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:20,094
Just continue filing lawsuits.

279
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,818
I'll be going.

280
00:20:41,556 --> 00:20:45,507
I'm sorry. I got too emotional.
I will get into character.

281
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:47,672
This isn't the right tone of voice.
I will try again.

282
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:52,074
Was I too harsh on him?

283
00:20:57,236 --> 00:20:59,235
<i>[Top Secret.]</i>

284
00:20:59,236 --> 00:21:02,036
He never gives me a break.

285
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,816
Universal dummy.

286
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,711
Oh my.

287
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:14,257
What did you just say?

288
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:17,123
- Why did you come here?
- I came here to get my money.

289
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:21,063
I don't have a car. So I ran all
the way here. I'm very tired.

290
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:24,871
She's sick. I can't talk
about repair fees with her now. Hold on.

291
00:21:24,872 --> 00:21:27,822
What about my friend? My friend Baobin
is sick in the body shop.

292
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:30,698
How long do I have to wait?

293
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:33,757
You give me the money, then.
Get it from your friend later.

294
00:21:33,758 --> 00:21:36,103
Okay. Give me your account number.

295
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:44,402
My account number is...

296
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,171
- Didn't CEO Choi call you?
- No. Why?

297
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,193
She talked about some lame PPL.

298
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:53,234
Just ignore her.
You are good at ignoring people.

299
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:55,979
You just focus on writing the script.

300
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,912
Romantic melodrama.

301
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:02,073
- Give me some money to call a cab.
- What did you just say?

302
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,682
Do you want me to run
all the way back home?

303
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:12,413
Did you say that to me?
"Universal dummy?"

304
00:22:17,787 --> 00:22:20,568
I only take luxury cabs.

305
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:22,133
I'm a top star.

306
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:34,585
Now you have 16.42 million won left.

307
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:39,122
Pay me back as soon as possible.
See you.

308
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:07,068
Please make me a reservation
for the first day of next month.

309
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,978
Are you finally going this time?

310
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:12,488
- You've always just asked for advice.
- Please get me a first-class seat.

311
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,998
And find the best hotel
and guide, please.

312
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,178
And show me a list of all the good
restaurants I should go to.

313
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:21,702
My destination will be Salar de Uyuni.

314
00:23:45,463 --> 00:23:47,097
You said you were busy with work.

315
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:48,597
Were you trying to
get away without telling me?

316
00:23:48,598 --> 00:23:51,313
I knew you would scold me.
So I didn't tell you. And I got caught.

317
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:54,649
Wow, I can't let this slide.

318
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,257
Do you have time? No, no. Let's go
together even if you don't have time.

319
00:23:58,258 --> 00:23:59,851
I have to send a package.

320
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:04,081
Let's go together, and let's get you
scolded for every little thing you did.

321
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:06,489
Are you trying to go on a date?

322
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,180
Because of my wrongdoings,
I can't even run away.

323
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,949
When did you plan your trip?

324
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,845
It's been a few years.

325
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:33,604
"The place where the sky and
the ground meet. Salar de Uyuni."

326
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,119
I want to go stand at that place.

327
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,534
- Wow.
- Why?

328
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,162
Oh my.

329
00:24:45,973 --> 00:24:47,585
Wow.

330
00:24:52,528 --> 00:24:54,028
This is amazing.

331
00:24:56,258 --> 00:25:00,948
Wow. I didn't know there was
a pretty road like this in Seoul.

332
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:03,142
I guess you're usually
stuck in your office working.

333
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:05,757
There's Dulle-gil Trail. When you look
into it, there are a lot of good places.

334
00:25:05,758 --> 00:25:10,150
Yes. I trap myself in the office,
and all I do is write.

335
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:15,093
I guess I wanted to be at a beautiful
place at the moment I die.

336
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:18,247
Like Saint Exupery. The writer who never
came back from a trip.

337
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:19,759
Doesn't that sound so cool?

338
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,142
What? Don't you think that's cool?

339
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:26,581
I thought about the same thing
when I was diagnosed with lung cancer.

340
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:34,238
Did you not know?
It's the secret everyone knows.

341
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,055
You are kidding, right?

342
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:41,842
I know I'm a humorous man...
but unfortunately, this is true.

343
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,302
At first, I blamed God so much.

344
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:48,969
Isn't it so lame for a doctor who
specializes in cancer to have cancer?

345
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,532
Anyway. I can't envy you
for entering the cancer world.

346
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,192
But I still welcome you.

347
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:11,315
Wow, is this like a secret garden?

348
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,748
It's boring to stay in the hospital room.

349
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:17,585
This is my favorite spot.

350
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:19,222
Here?

351
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,921
It feels like it's touching the sky.
Right?

352
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:31,821
Wow, that's right.
It's like Salar de Uyuni.

353
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,441
Wow.

354
00:26:38,372 --> 00:26:40,884
I feel sorry for you...

355
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:43,414
But it's made me feel better.

356
00:26:43,415 --> 00:26:46,610
Doctors can get cancer too.

357
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:50,277
I'm not the only one who's sick.

358
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:52,914
But your days are not numbered, right?

359
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,423
I had stage four cancer too.

360
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:58,257
It metastasized everywhere.
I thought I would only live about a year.

361
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,095
It has been five years already.

362
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:03,880
With this rascal in my body.

363
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,125
In the beginning, when I passed out
once or twice

364
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,968
my friends came over and held my hands
and cried for me.

365
00:27:08,969 --> 00:27:10,815
I got better, and I regained
consciousness. Again and again.

366
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:13,739
Now, it's like "You're still alive?"

367
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:19,140
As time went by, I realized this.

368
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,583
Living and dying is not
something I can decide.

369
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:23,680
To say it bluntly,
who's days aren't numbered?

370
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:25,987
No one knows how or when
he or she will die.

371
00:27:25,988 --> 00:27:28,813
So, today.

372
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,705
You should be thankful for today
and live happily.

373
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:35,001
So I can go on this trip, right?

374
00:27:35,002 --> 00:27:38,350
Of course.
There's no reason for you to not go.

375
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,882
But you have to go with your doctor.

376
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:42,893
My doctor...

377
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,989
- So are you going with me?
- Well. I'm...

378
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,140
It costs a lot to take me with you.

379
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:51,702
But since we are "cancer buddies,"
should I volunteer to go?

380
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,700
But...

381
00:27:56,701 --> 00:28:00,106
Can we really go?

382
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:03,095
Will I still be alive next month?

383
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:11,153
What kind of symptoms
will I be experiencing?

384
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:16,056
Hm. If you don't get treated,
pneumonia will come first.

385
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:19,623
With high fevers and hemoptysis.

386
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:22,037
Let's just talk about our trip instead.

387
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:23,735
About Salar de Uyuni.

388
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,244
That's right. That's great.

389
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:29,277
One. To go to Salar de Uyuni,
we have to eat really well.

390
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,418
For patients like us,
altitude sickness is the worst.

391
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,180
Two. We have to eat really really well.
We have to boost our immune system.

392
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,134
Three.

393
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,569
Let's eat something delicious.

394
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,875
Okay.

395
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:04,045
I looked though the CCTV.
She went out about an hour ago.

396
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:06,976
She left her phone off.
There's no caller record.

397
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:15,181
- You are Baek Seol's guardian, right?
- Oh, yes.

398
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:17,613
My wife must have been bored.

399
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:20,047
She's at home.

400
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,988
She said she wanted to
go home, and I told her to wait.

401
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:24,962
She just can't wait.

402
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:29,215
That's a relief.
I was worried where she went.

403
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,726
Thank you for your concerns.

404
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,182
- Please let her get discharged.
- Okay.

405
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:39,873
Hurry and find her.

406
00:29:39,874 --> 00:29:43,141
- Secretly. Quietly.
- Okay.

407
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,556
<i>These are songs
that can help you find peace.</i>

408
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:08,972
- Writer Lee.
- Yes?

409
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,086
You look a bit different these days.

410
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,172
- Really?
- How should I say this...

411
00:30:14,173 --> 00:30:18,268
You look more lively.

412
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:20,143
You look healthier.

413
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:26,265
- I look healthier?
- Yes.

414
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:29,823
It seems like you got prettier too.

415
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:31,664
It looks like you might
be dating someone soon.

416
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,347
Okay.

417
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,995
When is she going to get discharged?

418
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:49,346
They want to do more tests on her.

419
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:53,450
She didn't get hurt that much.
She is just wasting money.

420
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,548
She can get checked up
after she comes home.

421
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:59,748
Don't be like that. She is sick.

422
00:30:59,749 --> 00:31:02,998
Is she our servant?

423
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:05,394
Why? Did she say that?

424
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,777
Did she say that
we treated her like a servant?

425
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:11,101
Jeez.

426
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:15,594
What is wrong with him all of a sudden?
He's taking his wife's side.

427
00:31:15,595 --> 00:31:17,730
He must have done something wrong.

428
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:24,796
Writer Lee. You are here.

429
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,260
Why are we having
a team dinner all of a sudden?

430
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,264
Let's console Hae Sung.

431
00:31:29,265 --> 00:31:32,171
He was totally depressed after
the script reading yesterday.

432
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,702
Tomorrow is the title shoot.
We should make him feel better.

433
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:36,965
Totally depressed?
He was full of energy.

434
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:39,561
He only looks like he is full of energy.
He was embarrassed in front of everyone.

435
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:41,279
He must be feeling terrible inside.

436
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,892
He's not a kid.
Aren't you being too nice to him?

437
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:48,132
Forget it. I'm leaving. You said you're
going to manage Ryu Hae Sung.

438
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:51,759
Writer Lee. Yesterday's reading script,
I knew you wrote it that way

439
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,323
to trick Hae Sung.
But I let you slide on that one.

440
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:58,335
I didn't intend to do that.
That was not my intention.

441
00:31:58,336 --> 00:32:00,497
You should carry fire in one hand
and water in the other.

442
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,305
Since you tricked him once,
it's time to console him.

443
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:04,875
Okay, okay.

444
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:06,518
Let's go in.

445
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:14,914
Surprise! Writer Lee is here.

446
00:32:14,915 --> 00:32:19,686
Wow, our amazing Writer Lee is here.

447
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,613
- You are late. Have three drinks!
- No, thank you.

448
00:32:21,614 --> 00:32:25,217
Gosh. Don't be like that.
Let's get the wave of bomb shots going.

449
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:28,825
The one who doesn't drink this is
the one who wants our drama to fail.

450
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:32,505
If you don't drink this,
you have to do a crab dance.

451
00:32:32,506 --> 00:32:35,033
Crab dance.

452
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,673
Forcing someone to drink...

453
00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:39,892
This is an anachronism.

454
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,398
Everyone should enjoy
the drink that they like.

455
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,393
Look at her.

456
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:46,595
Writer Lee hates me.

457
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:53,449
Okay. I will just take your drink then.

458
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,433
Even though tomorrow is only
a title shooting

459
00:32:59,434 --> 00:33:01,561
it's Hitman's first filming session.

460
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,991
- Let's lift our glasses for our Hitman.
- Lift your cup.

461
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:07,496
When I say "Hitman,"
you guys say "amazing."

462
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,661
- Hitman!
- Amazing!

463
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:13,566
- Amazing.
- Amazing.

464
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:15,346
Amazing.

465
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:16,991
Amazing.

466
00:33:21,047 --> 00:33:23,917
By the way. Did you bring cash?

467
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,623
Cash?

468
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,644
Cash? What are you talking about?

469
00:33:27,645 --> 00:33:31,659
Writer Lee's friend crashed into
my precious friend Baobin.

470
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,969
But she hasn't given me
the money to repair it yet.

471
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,806
I'm going to pay you back.

472
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,199
It's because I can't get
a hold of my friend.

473
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,380
What? You can't get a hold of her?

474
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:42,654
Isn't this a hit-and-run case?

475
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:46,255
It's hit-and-run. Let's make a report.

476
00:33:46,256 --> 00:33:49,701
Okay. I will pay you now.
Are you satisfied?

477
00:33:51,816 --> 00:33:54,402
What is this?
Where are you going, Writer Lee?

478
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:05,230
Universal dummy! Jerk!

479
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:07,931
Writer Lee.

480
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:09,506
You don't have to withdraw money.

481
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,042
- The repair fees are all paid.
- It's all paid?

482
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:16,189
Hae Sung told people at our company
that he paid it with his money.

483
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,136
It has been settled already.

484
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:22,267
He is just joking around.

485
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:27,129
What is this then? He is trying to
double up on the repair fee?

486
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,151
What? That's not it.

487
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,786
What do you mean that's not it?

488
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:42,435
Why didn't you answer your phone?

489
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,225
You're breaking our contract.

490
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,384
Contract? What do you mean?

491
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,596
Are you guys dating?
Why do you guys have so many stories?

492
00:34:48,597 --> 00:34:50,736
It's nothing. What contract?
That's nonsense.

493
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:54,261
Hae Sung must have gotten drunk, right?

494
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:55,797
I'm totally fine.

495
00:34:55,798 --> 00:35:00,118
You're really good at playing innocent.

496
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,096
Assistant Director.
Send me a text message.

497
00:35:03,097 --> 00:35:05,436
A text message? Okay.

498
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:08,576
- It can be anything, right?
- Anything is fine.

499
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:14,355
I'm sorry. I will apologize.

500
00:35:14,356 --> 00:35:16,562
Is that your text alarm tone?

501
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:18,268
That sounds like Writer Lee's voice.

502
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:21,573
That's right. It sounds like her, right?

503
00:35:21,574 --> 00:35:24,567
My ringtone is a bit longer. Call me.

504
00:35:24,568 --> 00:35:26,151
- Just a moment please.
- Don't do it.

505
00:35:26,152 --> 00:35:28,323
- Don't do it.
- What are you doing?

506
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:30,160
- My ringtone is longer.
- Give it to me.

507
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:34,227
What's the matter?
<i>My ringtone is longer.</i>

508
00:35:34,228 --> 00:35:39,314
<i>My ringtone is longer.</i>

509
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:40,836
Hey!

510
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,533
Oh my. It looks like
you have a broken nose.

511
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,467
It's broken?

512
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:05,399
That woman...

513
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,840
Let me take a look.

514
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:19,654
Tomorrow is the title shooting.

515
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:22,681
How could a writer break
the main character's nose?

516
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:25,366
I'm sorry. I must have been drunk.

517
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:29,529
So why did you make me drink?
I'm not a good drinker.

518
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,524
Shouldn't we postpone tomorrow's filming?

519
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,707
Of course we have to postpone it.
Hitman is not Rambo.

520
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,393
How could he do a title shooting
with that nose?

521
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:38,978
Okay.

522
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,921
What happened? How did he hurt his nose?

523
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:47,786
Well. That's...

524
00:36:50,813 --> 00:36:53,450
Well. He fall.

525
00:36:53,451 --> 00:36:58,477
You know Hae Sung has a high nose.
His nose hit the ground first.

526
00:36:58,478 --> 00:37:00,026
What were you doing?

527
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:02,683
What were you doing when
your actor was breaking his nose?

528
00:37:02,684 --> 00:37:06,415
Tomorrow is the title shooting.
How could you let him drink?

529
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:08,146
I'm sorry.

530
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,175
I have a call.

531
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:18,204
Hello?

532
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,615
Yes.

533
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:29,974
Is she sleeping already?

534
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:09,193
Seol.

535
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,714
She stole a motorcycle?

536
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,598
She was a so good at
riding that motorcycle.

537
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,727
Did she used be a stuntwoman?

538
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:28,241
She remained silent,
she wouldn't say a word.

539
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:32,180
We told her we have to get her
fingerprints. And she called you.

540
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:34,832
She hasn't made it easy for us.

541
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,658
She is my best friend.

542
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:38,227
But she has some
unavoidable circumstances.

543
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:39,796
She can't really tell you guys.

544
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:42,877
Can I get the contact information
of the owner of the motorcycle?

545
00:38:42,878 --> 00:38:46,745
Yes. The owner doesn't want her
to be charged either.

546
00:38:46,746 --> 00:38:49,025
- You should go and talk to the owner.
- Okay.

547
00:38:56,266 --> 00:38:59,122
Mi Sun didn't even pick up her phone.

548
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:02,280
What must she be doing with Pil Ho
in this early evening? Gosh.

549
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,611
They are doing well, right?

550
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:09,589
Don't even get me started. They were
being lovey-dovey in front of me.

551
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,446
You know I have been single forever.

552
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:17,455
Was his name Seok Won? Their son is
a junior in high school, right?

553
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,656
Yes. He's very handsome.

554
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,142
He only got his parents' best features.

555
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:24,203
And he is doing well in school too.

556
00:39:24,204 --> 00:39:26,315
- That's a relief.
- Right?

557
00:39:35,512 --> 00:39:38,718
I came out to get some fresh air.

558
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,109
From the moment I saw that motorcycle...

559
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,446
I can't remember anything.

560
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:47,884
How did I get here?

561
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,571
I must have been out of my mind.

562
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:52,151
Hey. Nice job.

563
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:54,256
You are our legendary Baek Seol.

564
00:39:54,257 --> 00:39:57,783
All this motorcycle talk
sounds more like you.

565
00:39:57,784 --> 00:40:00,602
Tell me anything.
Your friend is a famous writer.

566
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:03,918
You saw me in the station. I can do
anything except for what I can't do.

567
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:10,157
Hey, eat it.

568
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:42,661
Why are you crying?

569
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,451
Damn it.

570
00:40:59,452 --> 00:41:03,747
You're making me lose my appetite.
Bunch of girls crying...

571
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:09,064
The sun is out. Women should be at home.

572
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,326
- It's bad luck.
- What did you just say?

573
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:16,586
How dare you look at me like that?

574
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:23,785
What now? Are you going to beat me up?

575
00:41:23,786 --> 00:41:27,476
- Come on. Get up.
- Seol.

576
00:41:31,724 --> 00:41:34,177
Hey, you! Hey!

577
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:38,518
- Let go!
- Hey!

578
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,322
Let go! Let go!

579
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:45,102
- This is for our table.
- Hey!

580
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:49,386
So Hye. Leave. Go! Get out, So Hye!

581
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:52,432
Hey! You! Hey!

582
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,952
Let's go!

583
00:42:05,835 --> 00:42:07,083
Put it on.

584
00:42:09,157 --> 00:42:10,707
- Hey.
- Let's go!

585
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:13,336
Get off! Hey!

586
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:34,344
Seol! Step on it!

587
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,289
Step on it!

588
00:43:32,161 --> 00:43:33,968
What should I do?

589
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:36,602
I've unintentionally stolen
this motorcycle.

590
00:43:36,603 --> 00:43:39,596
It's okay.

591
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:43,870
- This is now yours.
- Huh?

592
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:48,125
I made a deal with its owner
and bought it from him.

593
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,888
Don't you remember?
You gave me a laptop for my birthday.

594
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:55,930
I've made some money off of it.
This is my present for you.

595
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:57,506
So Hye.

596
00:43:57,507 --> 00:44:01,651
What do you think? Do you like it?

597
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:04,931
This is exactly like the one
that I used to have.

598
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,806
I should've gotten in touch
with you earlier.

599
00:44:09,807 --> 00:44:14,180
It's not like I was doing anything
important with my life.

600
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:16,683
From now on, you just let me know
if you need anything.

601
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:18,477
I used to be your bodyguard.

602
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:21,402
Wow, Seol! So charismatic!

603
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,013
Where have you been?
What have you been doing?

604
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,715
I haven't done anything
that might ruin your reputation.

605
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:55,047
I heard you were at the hospital.

606
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:01,510
That woman has such a pitiful life.

607
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:05,482
I don't want to hear about it.

608
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:09,448
Anyways, let's put all of that
behind us from now on.

609
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:11,822
Don't rashly act out.

610
00:45:26,998 --> 00:45:29,122
Mother, I'm back.

611
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:32,142
I see. Are you feeling better now?

612
00:45:32,143 --> 00:45:36,243
Yes. I'm sorry for making you worry.

613
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:39,547
You seem to be perfectly fine.

614
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:42,284
I guess you've had a nice vacation.

615
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:46,810
- Jin Tae had a hard time.
- Sure.

616
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,638
A wife needs to be healthy
for her husband.

617
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,629
Make sure this doesn't happen again.

618
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,755
Yes, Mother.

619
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:08,734
Mom.

620
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:11,328
<i>Jin Tae has sent me a humidifier.</i>

621
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:14,475
<i>He also said he'll take me
to a better nursing home.</i>

622
00:46:14,476 --> 00:46:15,884
That's good to hear.

623
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:18,397
<i>I feel so shameless just
accepting all these things.</i>

624
00:46:18,398 --> 00:46:20,506
<i>You be good to your husband.</i>

625
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:23,643
I see you're in a good condition today.

626
00:46:23,644 --> 00:46:26,604
I wish you could always be this healthy.

627
00:46:26,605 --> 00:46:30,761
- Hey.
- Yes, Mother!

628
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:33,744
Mom, I'll call you back later.

629
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:48,995
- Go sleep in your bed.
- That's all right.

630
00:46:48,996 --> 00:46:53,348
I got used to sleeping like this
when I was studying for the bar exam.

631
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:54,538
Should I get you some coffee?

632
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:56,875
Let's not drink coffee on
an empty stomach. Let's eat.

633
00:46:56,876 --> 00:46:59,198
Should I get some instant rice?
Or instant ramen noodles?

634
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,335
Get changed. Let's go out.

635
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:05,571
What are you in the mood for?
Tell me anything you want.

636
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,120
Because I'm a meat lover,
I'm in the mood for some meat.

637
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:12,980
- How about pork belly?
- Let's get some premium beef.

638
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:14,995
Really? Yes!

639
00:47:14,996 --> 00:47:17,111
Is today some special day?

640
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:20,904
It's the day we stuff ourselves
with beef until we barf it all out.

641
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,991
Yes!

642
00:47:22,992 --> 00:47:25,971
Hey, Lee So Hye. Long time no see.

643
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:28,270
- I heard you're starting a new drama.
- Yes.

644
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:31,913
- You still look so chic.
- Really?

645
00:47:31,914 --> 00:47:35,468
- It's from this new season.
- I see.

646
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:37,823
- By the way.
- Yeah?

647
00:47:37,824 --> 00:47:39,960
- Give me some money.
- What money?

648
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:43,576
You've borrowed money from me for all
these events and haven't paid me back.

649
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:47,056
There's 100,000 won from
the funeral for Director Hong's mother.

650
00:47:47,057 --> 00:47:49,143
100,000 won from
Director Song's wedding.

651
00:47:49,144 --> 00:47:52,826
180,000 won from the birthday party
for Writer Kim's baby.

652
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:54,384
Oh, really?

653
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:57,100
- I thought I paid you back.
- No, you haven't.

654
00:47:57,101 --> 00:47:58,428
That's right.

655
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:02,497
You've also borrowed 10,000 won from me
every time we've met at a cafe.

656
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,776
That by itself probably adds up
to about 100,000 won. Never mind.

657
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,560
Probably over 200,000 won.

658
00:48:06,561 --> 00:48:09,882
You owe me 580,000 won in total.

659
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:17,379
Really? Oh no. I only have
200,000 won in cash right now.

660
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,884
- Text me your bank account number.
- No. That's all right.

661
00:48:19,885 --> 00:48:22,172
Just give me what you have for now.

662
00:48:22,173 --> 00:48:27,049
And that bracelet. I think that'll do.

663
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,793
No way!

664
00:48:30,286 --> 00:48:32,024
I feel delighted for you.

665
00:48:32,025 --> 00:48:35,602
I hate those people who borrow money
in little sums and never pay you back.

666
00:48:35,603 --> 00:48:37,792
I guess that wasn't so bad.

667
00:48:37,793 --> 00:48:40,737
I should set a date and go around
collecting money from people.

668
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:45,116
Have I done something wrong?

669
00:48:45,117 --> 00:48:48,112
Is this my last feast
before you fire me?

670
00:48:49,402 --> 00:48:53,343
You remind me of my old self.

671
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:57,669
Eating kimbap in front of
the computer to save time.

672
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,303
I have regrets.

673
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:02,906
I should've written fewer lines.
And eaten some healthy food.

674
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:06,747
I should've gotten some fresh air
and went out for a walk.

675
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:09,628
We don't even have enough time to
write our script. How could we do that?

676
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,878
Yes? What?

677
00:49:17,269 --> 00:49:21,226
I don't need that. I said
I don't need that. I'm hanging up.

678
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:26,480
How could you answer a call like that?

679
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:28,004
Wasn't that your boyfriend?

680
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:30,785
He said it has been 300 days
since we first met.

681
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:34,839
He's crazy. Why would he count that?

682
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,835
Hurry and eat.
Go celebrate with him and do it.

683
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:38,984
What? Do what?

684
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:41,683
Do it. Do it a lot.

685
00:49:41,684 --> 00:49:43,813
Do it a lot when you can.

686
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:47,741
This is my congratulatory money
for your wedding.

687
00:49:47,742 --> 00:49:49,600
I'm giving it ahead of time.

688
00:49:49,601 --> 00:49:53,535
Go somewhere pretty and nice with him.

689
00:49:53,536 --> 00:49:55,843
This is amazing.

690
00:49:55,844 --> 00:49:59,210
This is not retirement money
or something, right?

691
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:01,977
I'm proud of your boyfriend who endured

692
00:50:01,978 --> 00:50:04,421
a workaholic writer like you
for 300 days.

693
00:50:04,422 --> 00:50:07,955
That's why I'm giving that money to you.

694
00:50:07,956 --> 00:50:09,823
You should date someone too.

695
00:50:09,824 --> 00:50:13,343
You're pretty.
You're wasting your beauty.

696
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:18,413
What about Hong Joon Ki?
He's single.

697
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:21,067
Really? Would he be okay?

698
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:23,417
Totally. He is perfect for you.

699
00:50:23,418 --> 00:50:26,056
He is a doctor and
a Director at the hospital.

700
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:29,817
He looks nice, and
he has a good personality.

701
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,397
Hey, hurry up and eat.
Stop talking nonsense.

702
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:33,987
Here.

703
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:34,744
So I have cancer right here.

704
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,635
You are still very pretty.

705
00:51:46,577 --> 00:51:48,297
What a waste.

706
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:00,777
<i>Did you listen to those songs?</i>

707
00:53:07,231 --> 00:53:09,861
<i>[Writer Lee So Hye.]</i>

708
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:12,894
<i>[Doctor Hong Joon Ki. Good.]</i>

709
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,306
<i>Are you in the secret garden now?</i>

710
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:23,887
<i>[Yes. Hm... Writer Lee, make a fist.]</i>

711
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,790
<i>Why?</i>

712
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,817
<i>I'm going to say something embarrassing.</i>

713
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:37,363
<i>Kekekeke. What is it?</i>

714
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,433
<i>A poet said this.</i>

715
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,884
<i>God made the night to let everyone rest.</i>

716
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,448
<i>And God also made stars.</i>

717
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:46,023
<i>How could we rest?</i>

718
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:52,126
<i>I'm trying to make a tight fist.</i>

719
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,463
<i>[Hahaha. I'm sorry.]</i>

720
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,558
<i>There's probably shooting stars
in Salar de Uyuni, right?</i>

721
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:07,791
<i>I heard half of the sky
is covered with stars.</i>

722
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:17,239
<i>The night sky is very pretty here too.</i>

723
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,833
<i>It would be nice if
you were here to see it with me.</i>

724
00:54:26,311 --> 00:54:28,725
<i>- How are you going to compensate this?</i>
- Oh my...

725
00:54:28,726 --> 00:54:30,843
<i>How could you ruin this beautiful face?</i>

726
00:54:30,844 --> 00:54:35,154
<i>It will take 10 weeks to heal.</i>

727
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:36,850
<i>Compensation?</i>

728
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:38,356
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

729
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,169
<i>I said what are you going to do?</i>

730
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,414
Gosh.

731
00:54:57,608 --> 00:55:01,237
May I kiss you?

732
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:06,221
Lee So Hye. My goodness.

733
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:09,951
I get the genre of the drama.
But what's with this kiss scene?

734
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:14,005
- She's so old-fashioned. Gosh.
<i>- I'm sorry. Let me apologize.</i>

735
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:19,627
That's right. She must be feeling sorry.

736
00:55:19,628 --> 00:55:23,562
<i>Text me your bank account number
and how much you want.</i>

737
00:55:23,563 --> 00:55:26,290
What's this? She didn't even apologize.

738
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:29,730
She just wants me to text her?

739
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:31,988
How could she be so shameless?

740
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:34,960
She's broken this famous actor's nose!

741
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:36,936
My goodness.

742
00:55:45,117 --> 00:55:48,683
Why won't he text me
his bank account number?

743
00:55:48,684 --> 00:55:52,996
What's this? Does he want to get
a big sum of money from me?

744
00:55:54,947 --> 00:55:56,868
Let's not get involved with him.

745
00:55:56,869 --> 00:55:59,530
If I get involved with this idiot,
it'll be my loss.

746
00:56:09,771 --> 00:56:13,002
<i>The night sky looks
absolutely beautiful here.</i>

747
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:15,650
<i>It would be nice if
you were here to see it with me.</i>

748
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:15,437
- Are you going to sit here?
- Of course. I need to sit down.

749
00:57:15,438 --> 00:57:19,835
- It's uncomfortable. Get a chair.
- Why? This is nice.

750
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:23,655
- We can't both sit here.
- This is comfortable for me.

751
00:57:38,092 --> 00:57:41,024
My goodness. Lee So Hye.

752
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,754
What have you done...

753
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:46,974
to this beautiful face?

754
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:02,689
I don't want to upload
a picture on a day like this.

755
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:06,152
But my fans will get sad if I don't.

756
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:10,844
I have no choice. Let's take a photo.

757
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:15,301
<i>Hae Sung, you can't get sick.</i>

758
00:58:15,302 --> 00:58:17,819
<i>- Are you okay?
- Who did this to you?</i>

759
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,639
<i>Seeing you in pain hurts me too.</i>

760
00:58:21,313 --> 00:58:24,343
My extreme masculinity is hard to mask.

761
00:58:24,344 --> 00:58:27,111
Then for today...

762
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:30,277
Let's go with a tough man concept
for an explosive response.

763
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:34,965
How's your nose? Are you okay?

764
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,746
May I kiss you?

765
00:58:40,536 --> 00:58:43,640
- No. That's so gross.
- What?

766
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:47,587
- Gross?
- Stop it. Stop it.

767
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:50,770
- Come over here, Chang Suk.
- Stop it. No! Don't!

768
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:53,807
Chang Suk!

769
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,697
A leather jacket is the epitome
of man's toughness.

770
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,302
A leather jacket.

771
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,016
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

772
00:59:23,835 --> 00:59:27,836
May I kiss you?

773
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,155
I've found it.

774
00:59:42,284 --> 00:59:44,482
What do you think about this one?

775
00:59:44,483 --> 00:59:47,507
- This one is nice.
- Try it on.

776
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:55,118
You look just like my drama's
main character.

777
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,297
Really?

778
00:59:56,298 --> 00:59:58,808
Because you're such a great model,
that jacket looks so good.

779
00:59:58,809 --> 01:00:00,489
You're the best.

780
01:00:02,425 --> 01:00:05,297
Give it to me. I'll buy it for you.
It's for my drama anyways.

781
01:00:05,298 --> 01:00:09,410
- No way.
- I'll think of it as an investment.

782
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:11,511
If you hit it big, be good to me.

783
01:00:11,512 --> 01:00:13,814
Don't you dare brush me off
once you become famous.

784
01:00:13,815 --> 01:00:17,585
- What if I do?
- Give it a try. You'll see.

785
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:20,160
He's not even worth it.

786
01:00:20,161 --> 01:00:23,890
Ryu Hae Sung is horrible at acting,
he lacks basic skills.

787
01:00:23,891 --> 01:00:25,451
He gained stardom because of his looks.

788
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:28,640
He won't last long.
Maybe one or two years.

789
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,280
Director, he's not even worth your time.

790
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:49,453
Wow. There are so many stars.

791
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:54,284
How useless. What do you want?

792
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:38,060
How was it?

793
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,979
Didn't my gaze make
your heart flutter just now?

794
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:43,410
Your heart was fluttering, right?

795
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:45,690
What the heck are you doing?

796
01:01:46,695 --> 01:01:49,232
That is what a kiss scene
should be like.

797
01:01:49,233 --> 01:01:52,138
I thought you should know

798
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:55,523
what kiss scenes in
romantic dramas should be like.

799
01:01:58,418 --> 01:02:00,846
"May I kiss you?"

800
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:04,890
Then the male protagonist
starts to kiss her.

801
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:06,830
As the guy slowly begins to kiss her...

802
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:10,396
the female character
cautiously closes her eyes.

803
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:14,768
This is a kiss scene from the eighties.

804
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:17,521
Nowadays, you need to
have some shocking...

805
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:11,694
<i>[Fantastic]</i>

806
01:03:11,695 --> 01:03:14,111
<i>When I was finally on stage
after years of training</i>

807
01:03:14,112 --> 01:03:15,665
<i>there's someone who saw my potential.</i>

808
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:18,061
<i>I'd like to gain recognition
from her again.</i>

809
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:20,718
<i>I'm not a strange man!</i>

810
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:22,352
<i>I'm not a criminal on the run.</i>

811
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:25,207
<i>If you just drive me to a place
with cabs, I'll pay you back.</i>

812
01:03:25,208 --> 01:03:28,031
<i>Instead of paying me back with money,
could you look after my motorcycle?</i>

813
01:03:28,032 --> 01:03:31,935
<i>Sure. If you just leave it here... Sure.</i>

814
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:33,573
<i>Lee So Hye. She's being so coy!</i>

815
01:03:33,574 --> 01:03:36,622
<i>She seems all innocent,
but she has a fiery side to her.</i>

816
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:38,163
<i>Can't believe I did that...</i>

817
01:03:38,164 --> 01:03:40,665
<i>This is a biological response.
All right?</i>

818
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,881
<i>Yes. Sure. So what?</i>

819
01:03:42,882 --> 01:03:46,093
<i>If it has metastasized to your lungs,
there is this drug in clinical testing.</i>

820
01:03:46,094 --> 01:03:49,131
<i>Do you know what my goal in life is?
A chair.</i>

821
01:03:49,132 --> 01:03:51,830
<i>When I die
I want 3,000 men to die with me...</i>

822
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:53,422
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>

823
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:55,252
<i>You've made my heart flutter
with your kiss.</i>

824
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:57,582
<i>I can't waste my time
with that kind of stuff.</i>

825
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,940
<i>Every second is precious to me.</i>
