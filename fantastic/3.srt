just now, right?

Your heart was pounding?

4
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:56,841
I'm right since you can't say a word.

5
00:00:56,841 --> 00:01:00,024
I'm a fast learner.

6
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:06,638
Thanks to you,
I'll be able to write great kiss scenes.

Thank you for your ideas!

8

Crazy! What did you just do?
You're crazy, Lee So Hye!

9
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,313
I'm going crazy here!

It's okay. I got back at him!

13
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:04,420
So why is my heart pounding so much?
I just haven't done it in so long.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,223
Yes, it's only a biological reaction.

The first shooting continuity is here!

21
00:04:01,778 --> 00:04:05,817
We will be shooting in Pyeongchang.
The offering will be held there, too.

22
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,675
- What? Where?
- Pyeongchang.

23
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,586
What's going on with you
since last night?

24
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:23,076
You know,
that was my first drama location.

25
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:28,362
Shall I say, it's like a sacred place
piled up with lots of memories?

26
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:33,048
- Memories? What kind?
- I have some.

27
00:04:33,048 --> 00:04:36,338
Are you talking about Writer Lee?

28
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:40,031
What are you saying out of nowhere?

29
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,334
I'm not!

30
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,613
You're not, right?

31
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:51,824

00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:09,463
It's 10 minutes by car.

35
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:13,831
Really... you're so coy!

36
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:20,379
You're so cold, but you would
write something like this?

37
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:27,692
So you want to take a trip down
memory lane, a pilgrimage of some sort.

38
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:46,012
- Writer Lee?
- Yes...

39
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,781
You wrote the main character's
name as "Kiss".

40
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,281
Huh?

My gosh, I used the "replace" function,
but something must've gone wrong.

43
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm really not feeling great.

44
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,065
I should go to the meeting first.

45
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:06,012
- With Dr. Hong Joon Ki?
- Yeah.

46
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:09,466
He asked me to come so he can tell me
something about the script in person.

47
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,156
Hold on!

48
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,336
Wear this for the meeting. You look
the prettiest when you wear this blouse.

49
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,970
Don't go overboard.
Dr. Hong Joon Ki is not my type!

50
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,601
Why do you say no first?
You never know what's going to happen.

51
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,920
He's just not my type!

52
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,596
Who is that?

53
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,589
My type! It's Ryu Hae Sung, Writer Lee!

54
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:43,264
Welcome!

55
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,853
I thought of my writers
as I was passing by.

Dumplings with glass noodle filling!

57
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:12,624
How did you know Writer Lee
is a glass noodle fiend?

58
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:16,168
Really? What coincidence is this?

59
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:18,396
We'll enjoy them. Thank you.

Oh, I saw the first shoot continuity.

62
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:34,346
I really love the location.

63
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,187
- The location? Where is it?
- I heard it's Pyeongchang.

64
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:39,089
What? Why did they do that?

65
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:45,314
I'm sure you'd never pick that location!

66
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,480
Sang Hwa, give him a cup of coffee.
How about coffee?

67
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,095
I wanted a cup of Americano just now.

68
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:54,262
Yes! One Americano!

69
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:02,817
Well then, I have go to an interview.
Enjoy your coffee and goodbye!

70
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,971
- Let me come with...
- You should drink your coffee.

71
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,795
This is Writer Lee's favorite place.

72
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:20,607
It's Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.

73
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:28,420
By any chance, did Writer Lee
say anything about me?

74
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,115
Well...

75
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:35,206
She said that you should practice a lot
for the emotional scenes.

76
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:39,711
Do you know the actor Park Won Sang?

77
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,094
He's worked on four dramas
with Writer Lee

78
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:44,477
so he knows the tone
of her scripts the best.

79
00:08:44,477 --> 00:08:45,477
He does?

80
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,094
Dr. Hong!

81
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,114
That's what we were talking about.

82
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:03,057
Hold on.

83
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:06,380
What's with this? Looking untidy...

84
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,850
- Writer Lee!
- Oh, hi!

85
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,153
I ran a little late.

86
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:22,346
Not at all. I asked you to come because
I wanted to introduce you to someone.

87
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:27,743
This is Dr. Jamie. She's dispatched to
the States for clinical research now.

88
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:29,301
I see.

89
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:32,124
- Hello.
- Hi.

90
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:35,326
<i>[SKIN AGE: 20'S. NO NECK WRINKLES]</i>
I heard a lot about you from Dr. Hong.

91
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,059
<i>[HAIR: SHINY
BREAST: C-CUP?]</i>

92
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,600
- Please come this way.
- Wait, I am...

93
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,168
- You should see her.
- Wait, Dr. Hong...

94
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:49,091
- I'm going to examine you.
- Okay.

95
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:59,216
It's playing hide-and-seek.

96
00:09:59,216 --> 00:10:01,597
This is why you couldn't
have noticed it at all.

97
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,013
Yes.

98
00:10:03,013 --> 00:10:04,761
If it's spread to the lungs...

99
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:07,793
there is a pretty good
clinical treatment.

100
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:10,217
Are you telling me to become a subject
of a clinical experiment?

101
00:10:10,217 --> 00:10:12,389
Not an experiment, it's research.

102
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,466
Although both words
cause some resistance.

103
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:18,294
I'm not really convinced.
It can't have been vetted.

104
00:10:18,294 --> 00:10:22,030
Of course I can't tell you
it's 100 percent effective.

105
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,769
It's not a complete cure, either.

106
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:25,826
But the quality of your life
will definitely improve

107
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,884
while you are treated for cancer.

108
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:31,594
How you live is as important
as how long you live.

109
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,409
Okay, I will think about it.

110
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:37,950
Yes, take time to think about it
and get your courage up.

111
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,465
Okay, thank you.

112
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,360
Welcome!

113
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,544
It's an honor to meet with you, sir!

114
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:22,000
No no, stop it! Have a seat.

115
00:11:30,317 --> 00:11:35,758
Director Yoon Chul Hyung asked me,
so I am meeting with you...

116
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:40,054
But as you know, acting is not
something you can learn, right?

117
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:42,481
But I really want to do a good job.

118
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,558
And I'm sick of hearing
about my "foot acting."

119
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,547
That's good then.

120
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:49,005
You're all set.

121
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:50,754
Now...

122
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:53,943
that desperation you have right now...

123
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:56,735
That's the mindset of an actor.

124
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:59,674
I have been desperate
for a really long time...

125
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:02,269
but I don't know how. I mean it.

126
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,986
Please at least help me
find a tone for the script.

127
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:11,471
The tone is each actor's
unique character.

128
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,013
Hae Sung,
I'm sure you can do really well.

129
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,321
I will cheer for you.

130
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,682
Sir, wait. Wait...

131
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,658
This is a show of my innocent heart.

132
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,812
Put it down.

133
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,510
Put it down!

134
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,591
Hey.

135
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:45,672
You do mean it.

136
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,413
Let's work together.

137
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:02,785
My Hae Sung, since when did you
want to become an actor? And why?

138
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:04,942
It was when I was six years old.

139
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:10,077
<i>Silent night, holy night.</i>

140
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:18,380
<i>All is calm, all is bright.</i>

141
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:26,283
<i>Round yon Virgin Mother and Child</i>

142
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:33,932
<i>Holy Infant so tender and mild</i>

143
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:48,721
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

144
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,966
<i>I still cannot forget how touched I was
right at that moment.</i>

145
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,798
When I think about it, I do have
a talent for acting for sure!

146
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:12,095
We'll see if you have a talent or not.

147
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:18,341
Anyway, you've been dreaming about the
applause from an audience since then?

148
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,787
Yes.

149
00:14:19,787 --> 00:14:23,577
But I've never gotten
that kind of applause since then.

150
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:24,936
Not even once?

151
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:28,298
No, there was this one time.

152
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:32,277
When I finally got on stage
after years as a trainee...

153
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:35,239
there was someone who saw my potential.

154
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:46,263
I want to be recognized by her
one more time.

155
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,629
Okay.

156
00:14:57,038 --> 00:15:01,567
Now, which scenes
do you find so difficult?

157
00:15:09,448 --> 00:15:10,767
This is the scene.

158
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,376
I've practiced so much,
but I still don't know what to feel.

159
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,240
First, no need to make it difficult.

160
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,107
All of the answers
are right here in the script.

161
00:15:21,107 --> 00:15:25,700
Just immerse yourself naturally
in the script...

162
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,804
- Should we try this?
- Yes.

163
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,735
Are you going through
with the wedding after all?

164
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,110
Is this the love you spoke of? Destiny?

165
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,667
This is not right!

166
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,081
Wait, wait... Let me have it.

167
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:49,438
Okay, look, look... Look.

168
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:52,993
First, the emotion.

169
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,289
The feel.

170
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,888
Now...

171
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,051
Are you really going through
with the wedding after all?

172
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,089
Was this it?
Is this the love you spoke of?

173
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,676
Is this destiny?

174
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:06,220
This is not right.

175
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,864
I'm leaving.
No, don't leave. Stop.

176
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:12,914
Stop. Stop there. Stop there!

177
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:19,407
I admire you, sir!

178
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,767
No no no...

179
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,636
This is not the answer.

180
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:26,932
Right, this is not the answer.
This is just how I feel.

181
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:30,386
Now you need your emotions.
You're not doing this with your head.

182
00:16:30,386 --> 00:16:31,464
Fall into your emotion.

183
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:33,756
I think I know a little now.
I'll try it again.

184
00:16:36,115 --> 00:16:37,956
Was this it?
Is this the love you spoke of?

185
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,114
Is this destiny?
This is not right!

186
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:44,889
Fall into your emotion! Here, here!
Fall into your emotion! Your emotion!

187
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,184
I'm sorry to raise my voice,
but let's fall into your emotion.

188
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:49,368
- Yes, I got it.
- Not your head. Your emotion.

189
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:52,206
No! Don't go! Stop! Stop right there!

190
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:55,803
I said, stop! Stop... I said, stop...

191
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,488
Like this? I'm done.

192
00:16:58,488 --> 00:17:01,703
Come over here! Come, come here!
How can you...

193
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:18,509
The rain...

194
00:17:20,184 --> 00:17:21,559
What happened to your nose?

195
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:25,903
I got a nosebleed
from acting too passionately.

196
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:29,106
You know, they say people throw up blood
when they gain a voice of God.

197
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,515
But I got a nosebleed.

198
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:32,942
Really?

199
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:34,873
I should've watched you.

200
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,144
I guess it's definitely different

201
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,415
since you're the nation's
representative actor.

202
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:38,917
Yes.

203
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,361
What's with the shower all of a sudden?

207
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,547
She's ignoring me again.

208
00:18:45,547 --> 00:18:48,895
Playing hard to get...

209
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,932
What can I say? Women...

210
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:54,000
What happens if I push you away?

211
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,271
What are you saying?

212
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:59,092
My lines! I'm practicing my lines.

00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,324
This way, please.

215
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,924
You're home.

216
00:20:39,924 --> 00:20:42,548
Mother, surprise!

217
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:45,585
My goodness, I'm so glad to see you.

218
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:48,330
I ran into her at a department store.

219
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,586
We have similar taste.

220
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:53,561
People might think you're sisters.

221
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,607
We've decided to become sisters.

222
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:58,256
I'm okay for your adopted daughter,
aren't I, Mother?

223
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,587
It's an honor and a happy occasion!

224
00:21:01,952 --> 00:21:04,616
Seol, bring out something cold to drink.

225
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:05,740
Yes, Mother.

226
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,167
No, I'm hungry.
Give me some food please.

227
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,778
She gave me a government
content development project.

228
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:17,826
I wanted to treat her to a nice place,
but she really wanted to eat at home.

229
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:21,430
I used that as an excuse
to see you, Mother.

230
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,974
I'm glad you came.

231
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:25,636
Seol, grill the short ribs

232
00:21:25,636 --> 00:21:28,349
and make the soybean stew and
a few of the vegetable dishes.

233
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:30,461
Yes, Mother.

234
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,474
By the way, will Jin Tae be late?

235
00:21:32,474 --> 00:21:35,142
Call him and tell him that
Assemblywoman Lee is here!

236
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,391
Should I?

237
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:41,147
<i>Jin Tae must've heard us.</i>

238
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,669
<i>How did you come so early?
Did you know we were coming?</i>

239
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,606
<i>No, I got your call as I was
getting out of my car.</i>

240
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:48,866
<i>- Wow, what brings you here?
- To surprise you!</i>

241
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:59,404
I really didn't know about this.

242
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,607
What am I supposed to do?

243
00:22:01,607 --> 00:22:03,928
She came as my sister's guest.
I can't leave now.

244
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:07,192
This will never happen again.
Just get through today, okay?

245
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,518
What are you doing?

246
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:13,048
- Wash some fruits. I'll peel them.
- Yes.

247
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:24,131
Everything is great. I'd like to come
here and eat this food every day.

248
00:22:28,064 --> 00:22:31,518
- You should be careful!
- I'm sorry, Mother.

249
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,511
I admire you, President Choi.

250
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,907
To jump into the
entertainment business as a woman

251
00:22:38,907 --> 00:22:41,304
and to come all the way here...

252
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:43,945
It's not easy at all. It's human victory.

253
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:49,031
Seriously, this is an industry
of the uncivilized.

254
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:51,411
I really had a tough time.

255
00:22:52,907 --> 00:22:54,054
I'm tearing up.

256
00:22:54,054 --> 00:22:56,750
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

257
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,686
Now, only good things
will happen to you.

258
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:02,799
You'll come out
at the top of the industry.

259
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,266
And Attorney Choi
will enter the Assembly Hall!

260
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:07,509
I have my faith in you!

261
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,076
Of course! No need to say the obvious
in the family.

262
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:15,617
I was told that a precious one
will enter our house this year.

263
00:23:15,617 --> 00:23:17,894
And it is you, Assemblywoman Lee.

264
00:23:17,894 --> 00:23:21,951
Mother, don't be so formal with me.
I am your adopted daughter.

265
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,666
- We're family!
- We're family!

266
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,979
Oh, do you have plans for vacation?

267
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:31,134
I'd like to invite you
to my vacation house.

268
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:34,071
I can adjust my schedule.
What about you?

269
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:40,000
He's the owner.
Of course he can find time for vacation.

270
00:23:40,717 --> 00:23:42,198
I'll adjust my schedule.

271
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:48,303
My gosh, I get to taste Ms. Baek's food
three times a day?

272
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:50,701
I'm so happy!

273
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:57,278
Thanks to you, we get to go on family
vacation this year. It's been a while.

274
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,993
Let's go shop for swimsuits,
all three of us!

275
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:00,710
Oh my, really?

276
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:03,673
It'll be so much fun! Right, Mother?

277
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,049
Is this Traffic Control?

278
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,057
The lights in front
of the post office in Yeouido.

279
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,694
If it's not fixed quickly

280
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,333
innocent citizens can get hurt
and even die from auto accidents.

281
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:52,481
On top of that, the guiding sound for
the hearing impaired is broken.

282
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:56,401
Yes, please come quickly.
I will be waiting here.

283
00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:13,298
I'm sorry. I'm late because I had to
take care of something important.

284
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:17,530
It's okay, I came a little late too.

285
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:21,953
By the way, you look better
in person than in picture.

286
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:26,657
- You look better in picture.
- Excuse me?

287
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,280
It's a joke.

288
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,018
I'm sorry if it wasn't funny.

289
00:25:36,876 --> 00:25:38,420
You should order something.

290
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:51,576
You know, it feels stuffy sometimes.

291
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:54,311
I feel refreshed
when I drive this route.

292
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,377
Please stop over there for a bit.

293
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,200
If you really want me to.

294
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:08,750
What do you want to do on the road
where there is no light?

295
00:26:10,963 --> 00:26:12,963
Your driver's license
should be taken away.

296
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:14,007
Sorry?

297
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,007
Four traffic light violations

298
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,624
and I can't even count how many times
you went over the speed limit.

299
00:26:16,624 --> 00:26:18,876
You didn't even turn on the signal
when you changed lanes.

300
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,526
You may think that it's okay
if you just pay fines.

301
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:23,420
But you could cause
a large-scale accident.

302
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,999
And in case of a big accident

303
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,145
responsibility also lies on the
passenger who didn't stop the speeding.

304
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:29,473
What the...

305
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:32,707
- It's no fun at all!
- It's not fun for me either.

306
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,885
Get out. I will drive.

307
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,624
What kind of shitty punk is this?
Get lost!

308
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,382
Look! Hey!

309
00:26:47,382 --> 00:26:50,026
You should at least take me home!

What I have is...

00:32:41,013 --> 00:32:44,323
Instead of paying me,
can you hold on to my motorcycle?

331
00:32:46,357 --> 00:32:48,393
I don't have a place to park it.

332
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:51,925
It's good.

333
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:56,487
I mean, it's a good environment
to park the motorcycle.

Hey, I'm not here. If someone
looks for me, tell him I'm not here.

346
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,824
How do I turn this off?

347
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:53,473
Sir!

348
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:54,932
I'm here!

00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,688
Oh... you came!

00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:03,906

00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:04,924
Thank you!

00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,285
That's great.

I'm glad to hear it.

354

It's a scene with only one line today.

355
00:34:12,539 --> 00:34:17,414
But I'm a bit confused about the
pronunciation, and how to say it.

356
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:21,391
Okay... as you hand a gun

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,612
- Go ahead.
- Yes.

359
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,384
Choose one. Will you die?
Or will you kill me?

360
00:34:33,487 --> 00:34:35,293
So you're asking questions.

361
00:34:35,293 --> 00:34:38,349
I don't think all of them are questions.

362
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,273
Look at me.

363
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,081
Choose one. Will you die,
or will you kill me?

364
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,887
Of course you are...

365
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:54,199
No no, try it again. Try it again.

366
00:34:57,009 --> 00:34:58,400
Choose one.

367
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,418
Will you die? Or will you kill me?

368
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:13,887
Leave!

369
00:35:13,887 --> 00:35:16,293
Go, go, go! Leave, you bastard!

370
00:35:16,293 --> 00:35:19,050
Go away, go! You bastard, go away!

371
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,436
Go! I said, leave!

372
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:24,498
Go away, go away! Go away!

373
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:28,498
That's good!

374
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,815
That's good!

375
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:32,456
- That's good.
- Really?

00:35:32,456 --> 00:35:34,483
Thank you, sir!

377
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,668

474
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,210

00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,875

- I'm also busy, and I'm hungry.

By the way,
where were you going all dressed up?

479
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:46,483
Mind your own business,

480
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:49,927

484
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,387
Give me everything on this menu.

485
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:04,942
And the best one for wine, please.
No, I'll have the most expensive one.

486
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:12,547
- We will order shortly.
- Sure.

487
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:16,798
What's with you?

488
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:19,255
I want to settle my debt quickly.

489
00:48:19,255 --> 00:48:21,722
Take the food and the wine
as an interest payment.

490
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,577
And I'll give you the rest later.

491
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:25,431

492

over the script and receive my payment.

501
00:48:45,077 --> 00:48:47,391

Oh, that?

503
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:51,012
It was a joke, of course.

504

Was there ever sincerity between us?

505
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:56,942
Is this because of what happened?

506
00:48:56,942 --> 00:48:58,514
You really have no shame.

507
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:00,262
Even an apology wouldn't be enough.

508
00:49:00,262 --> 00:49:02,268
If I apologized, would you accept it?
I tried!

509
00:49:02,268 --> 00:49:05,143
- But you wouldn't even hear it.
- Because it was worthless.

510
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,050
I'll pay the bill, so eat your food.

511
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,682
You want me to apologize,
but it's not worthwhile to hear it?

512
00:49:20,682 --> 00:49:23,643
- It makes no sense!
- You don't make any sense either!

513
00:49:23,643 --> 00:49:26,590
Fine, what should I do?
What can I do for you?

514
00:49:27,789 --> 00:49:31,637
I'm sorry. I had no choice!

515
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:35,902
Let go of me!

516
00:49:35,902 --> 00:49:37,972
Don't ever bring it up again.

517
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:40,367
I have no time to waste
over such petty things!

518
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,940
<i>Writer Lee, we're in big trouble!</i>

519
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,965
Ryu Hae Sung signed a contract
with President Choi.

520
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:58,934
It's just a rumor. It's not true.

521
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:00,347
The news is out.

522
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,409
He's on our rival show.

523
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:03,876
<i>[FIERCE ROOKIE RYU HAE SUNG
MAKES HOME AT ADONIS ENTERTAINMENT]</i>

524
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:07,311
Our director is up in arms and
the TV station turned upside down.

525
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:08,880
<i>[CHOSEN AS THE LEAD
OF A MTC MINI SERIES]</i>

526
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,097
Didn't he make a promise with you
that he'd do our series?

527
00:50:12,097 --> 00:50:15,711
This is Writer Lee So Hye. Let me talk
to Ryu Hae Sung, it's urgent.

528
00:50:15,711 --> 00:50:18,740
<i>Writer Lee, this is Choi Jin Sook.</i>

529
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,402
<i>Listen up.</i>

530
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:22,545
<i>Ryu Hae Sung signed a contract with me</i>

531
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,688
<i>under the condition
he wouldn't do your series.</i>

532
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:30,815
I'll speak to Ryu Hae Sung directly.
Let me talk to him.

533
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:32,621
<i>Hold on.</i>

534
00:50:33,786 --> 00:50:35,398
<i>He doesn't want to talk to you.</i>

535
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:46,228
What the heck is this?
How can you make me look so ridiculous?

536
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:49,206
What are you going to do?
We even have a complete staff!

537
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:51,690
This is humiliating...

538
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:53,121
I'm sorry.

539
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:56,702
Just wait and see.
I'm going to bury Ryu Hae Sung alive!

540
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:00,121
He's not even worth it.

541
00:51:00,121 --> 00:51:03,367
Ryu Hae Sung can't act,
and he has no basics at all.

542
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:05,130
He only got famous because of his looks.

543
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,898
How long could he possibly last?
A year or two, tops.

544
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,125
It's not even worthwhile
to deal with him.

545
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:12,007
Still, how can he betray
the writer who supported him

546
00:51:12,007 --> 00:51:13,891
just because he got a little famous?

547
00:51:13,891 --> 00:51:15,998
It's turned out better, actually.

548
00:51:15,998 --> 00:51:18,559
Let's find a solution quickly.

549
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,378
How about Ha Yeon? I think he's good.

550
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:34,719
Sir, I'll head somewhere else,
not Bundang.

551
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:44,719
Welcome!
How many do you have in the party?

552
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,659

553
00:51:46,659 --> 00:51:50,172
- No, my friends are coming.
- I see, come this way.

My goodness, what brings our
Ms. Lawsuit all the way here?

557
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:55,516
I heard our ace was skipping dinner and
practicing, so of course I should come.

558
00:53:57,702 --> 00:54:00,500
What is your real business?
Get to the point fast.

559
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,501
The CEO of a
Chinese entertainment company

560
00:54:02,501 --> 00:54:04,503
invited you to
his daughter's birthday party.

561
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:05,922
I'll ask to have it scheduled
when there is no shooting

562
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:07,344
so let's go for two days.

563
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,541
We agreed that there won't be anything
scheduled while I shoot this drama.

564
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:14,641
Do I need to read the contract to you
again? I would've said no if I could.

565
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:16,036
You have to go to this one.

566
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,016
What do I have to do
to get away from you?

567
00:54:21,016 --> 00:54:22,387
Can I do that if I retire?

568
00:54:22,387 --> 00:54:25,632
That's also a breach of contract.
It's until I tell you to retire.

569
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:29,349
- It'll be over only when I die?
- I'm on your side.

570
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,523
Don't try to run away,
and hold on tight.

571
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:34,277
It hurts more if you fall from high up.

572
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:36,956
I'm leaving.

573
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:21,090
Jamie?

574
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,349
You got caught!

575
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:27,788
Here you go.

576
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,443
Hey!

577
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:38,652
Awesome.

578
00:55:38,652 --> 00:55:40,233
Bravo!

579
00:55:41,217 --> 00:55:43,454
Jamie, great! You're it!

580
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:47,780
Wow, I wanted to play around
just like you.

581
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,371
Two-timing! Multiple-timing!
How great is this?

582
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,253
You, that's how you should live.

583
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:57,856
You should keep
living on like that forever!

584
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:03,507
You seem to have had too much to drink.
Are you all right?

585
00:56:03,507 --> 00:56:05,005
Okay!

586
00:56:06,474 --> 00:56:11,911
Don't you worry! I'll keep this secret
from Dr. Hong Joon Ki!

587
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:15,536
You're awesome! Have fun!
Have fun!

588
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:17,864
I like it! I like it!

589
00:56:17,864 --> 00:56:20,050
Go! Go!

590
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:33,005
Hi, Joon Ki. Your patient who disappeared
is at a night club now.

591
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:35,155
She's completely drunk.

592
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,043
We should hang out together!
You're having all the fun by yourself!

593
00:56:57,907 --> 00:56:59,445
Are you looking for me?

594
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:02,628
She's my younger sister.

595
00:57:04,157 --> 00:57:05,918
We don't look alike at all, do we?

596
00:57:05,918 --> 00:57:08,688
My brother is really not my type.

597
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:12,050
Have fun now!

598
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:17,083
You're Jamie's older brother?

599
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:21,878
Brother!

600
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,148
Brother...

601
00:58:17,858 --> 00:58:19,086
Are you okay?

602
00:58:25,336 --> 00:58:27,554
Thank you, Brother.

603
00:58:36,887 --> 00:58:38,907
I'm fine!

604
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:49,454
To tell you the truth,
I spent a lot of money today.

605
00:58:49,454 --> 00:58:52,822
For the first time in my life,
really a lot.

606
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:56,211
I went crazy with shopping.

607
00:58:56,211 --> 00:58:59,467
You did well! You must've
also gotten your hair done.

608
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:01,052
You look pretty.

609
00:59:01,052 --> 00:59:03,820
I look pretty? Really?

610
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,664
I did this, too.

611
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,583
I have a secret. Should I tell you?

612
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:17,289
I got waxing done.

613
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:19,846
- What?
- Waxing!

614
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:22,309
Brazilian waxing!

615
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:29,371
Once you get treated for cancer,
you'll lose them anyway. Why?

616
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:41,036
Cancer treatment...

617
00:59:43,132 --> 00:59:45,356
I didn't know that!

618
00:59:45,356 --> 00:59:47,748
- You know I'm joking, right?
- Yes.

619
00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:02,385
I canceled my trip to Uyuni.

620
01:00:03,315 --> 01:00:05,967
I won't get to go anyway...

621
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:09,226
I'll just spend it all.

622
01:00:09,226 --> 01:00:11,286
So I spent it all.

623
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:16,447
Do you know what my life goal is?

624
01:00:16,447 --> 01:00:17,804
What is it?

625
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:19,541
Queen Uija.

626
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:24,425
Like Queen Uija, I want to have 3,000
male servants die with me when I die.

627
01:00:25,824 --> 01:00:27,565
- All 3,000 of them?
- Yes!

628
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,668
But I really don't have time
to seduce 3,000 men.

629
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,166
I should've had fun sooner.

630
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:39,117
Queen Uija...

631
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:41,228
I'm Queen Uija because I've only been

632
01:00:41,228 --> 01:00:43,338
sitting on the chair (WORD PLAY)
and writing.

633
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:47,175
But...

634
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,952
If I die alone...

635
01:00:53,036 --> 01:00:56,186
I think I'll be so scared and lonely.

636
01:00:57,682 --> 01:01:03,275
Other people have kids and husbands...

637
01:01:03,275 --> 01:01:06,251
But I have no one.

638
01:01:07,525 --> 01:01:11,684
By myself... I will be so sick...

639
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:15,882
I was so scared...

640
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:31,001
I'm here for you, your cancer colleague.

641
01:01:34,115 --> 01:01:35,989
Oh, that's right.

642
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,559
Will you go out with me?

643
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,731
Why aren't you answering me?

644
01:01:48,702 --> 01:01:50,764
Did I just get rejected?

645
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:56,291
Can't you just go out with me, Honey?
