00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,750

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,224
<font color="yellow">But I have no one.</font>

8
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:38,950
<font color="yellow">Alone... It will hurt a lot.</font>

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,626
<font color="yellow">It's very scary.</font>

11
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,269
<font color="yellow">Oh, that's right.</font>

12
00:01:05,193 --> 00:01:07,138
<font color="yellow">Will you date me then?</font>

13
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,380
<font color="yellow">Oh. You...</font>

14
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,237
<font color="yellow">Wait. What's your name?
No, your phone number...</font>

15
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:36,561
<font color="yellow">Then give me your email address.</font>

16
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:40,669

00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:53,832
<font color="yellow">That scared me.</font>

20
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:07,576
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Writer Lee...</font>

21
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:09,732
<font color="yellow">Are you getting ready?</font>

22
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,588
<font color="yellow">The car is waiting for you.
You have to hurry.</font>

- Okay.</font>

25
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,585
<font color="yellow">You didn't pack your stuff yet, right?
I'll pack it for you. Take your time.</font>

26
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:24,743
<font color="yellow">- Pack my stuff?
- Today is the first day of shooting.</font>

27
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:26,312
<font color="yellow">And we have to do our rituals too.</font>

<font color="yellow">Oh my, Writer Lee, you got
your nails done. It's so pretty.</font>

31
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:53,468
<font color="yellow">It looks chic. Are you dating someone?</font>

32
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:55,791
<font color="yellow">She should get married.</font>

33
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,368
<font color="yellow">Who is it, Writer Lee?</font>

34
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:00,020
<font color="yellow">By any chance... Director Hong?</font>

35
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,948
<font color="yellow">She is not feeling well.</font>

36
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,757
<font color="yellow">She is dating someone, right?</font>

37
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,744
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

38
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,159
<font color="yellow">Just say it outloud.</font>

39
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,424
<font color="yellow">I'm not dating anyone.</font>

40
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:20,428
<font color="yellow">I went to get my hair done and
I did my nails just to refresh myself.</font>

41
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:23,745
<font color="yellow">I'm getting carsick.
I'm going to take a nap.</font>

42
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:26,139
<font color="yellow">I think she is dating someone.</font>

43
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,053
<font color="yellow">We have today's schedule.</font>

44
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:39,553
<font color="yellow">- Today's schedule is out?
- Yes, Director Yoon. Today...</font>

45
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:41,057
<font color="yellow">You are looking at the wrong page.</font>

46
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,887
<font color="yellow">- You're here.
- Yes, I'm here. It's going well, right?</font>

47
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,796
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hae Sung has been here since dawn.
He's getting ready for the rehearsal.</font>

48
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:05,510
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

49
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:27,940
<font color="yellow">Wow, our Actor Ryu.
You are really working hard.</font>

50
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,760
<font color="yellow">You look very nice.</font>

51
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:38,000
<font color="yellow">Shall we check the camera angle?</font>

52
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,031
<font color="yellow">Wow, this looks great.</font>

53
00:05:52,341 --> 00:05:54,642
<font color="yellow">- What is this?
- You jerk!</font>

54
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:56,291
<font color="yellow">You bastard!</font>

55
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,144
<font color="yellow">This is my land.
What in the world are you all doing here?</font>

56
00:05:58,144 --> 00:06:00,012
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. He's a neighbor.
He's been here for a while.</font>

57
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:03,781
<font color="yellow">- Mister, you have to leave now.
- Leave.</font>

58
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,671
<font color="yellow">- Buy him a lunch.
- You guys get out.</font>

59
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:24,611
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

60
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:27,238
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at
me like that, you bitch.</font>

61
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:30,536
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

62
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:32,767
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing?</font>

63
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,308
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing? Huh?</font>

64
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:39,072
<font color="yellow">What... What are you doing?</font>

65
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:41,933
<font color="yellow">Jump off from there,
and we should use the helicam.</font>

66
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:44,332
<font color="yellow">- And the next scene will be over--
- Yes.</font>

67
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:51,399
<font color="yellow">Oh. What... What is that?</font>

68
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:54,449
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that Writer Lee?
- It's Writer Lee.</font>

69
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,057
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hung Jong, hurry and go over there.</font>

70
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:30,611
<font color="yellow">So Hye, are you okay?</font>

71
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:31,880
<font color="yellow">Lee So Hye!</font>

72
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,014
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

73
00:07:58,308 --> 00:08:00,354
<font color="yellow">Actor Ryu! Writer Lee!</font>

74
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:04,803
<font color="yellow">- Come this way.
- Oh, it hurts.</font>

75
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,089
<font color="yellow">- Wow.
- Writer Lee, are you okay?</font>

76
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:18,522
<font color="yellow">- You could have been in big trouble.
- I'm okay.</font>

77
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:21,200
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to
have a heartattack.</font>

78
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,397
<font color="yellow">You ran all the way and jumped off...</font>

79
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,882
<font color="yellow">You are really hitman K.</font>

80
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,303
<font color="yellow">Just like a scene in thedrama...</font>

81
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,776
<font color="yellow">- Then why did you all stay away? Huh?
- What?</font>

82
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,872
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

83
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:41,536
<font color="yellow">You guys should have filmed
that fantastic scene.</font>

84
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:44,853
<font color="yellow">No one filmed it, right?
Director, the camera was not on, right?</font>

85
00:08:44,853 --> 00:08:48,252
<font color="yellow">Gosh. That scene would have been amazing.</font>

86
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:56,465
<font color="yellow">What is it like to be coming back
to life, Writer Lee?</font>

87
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:10,778
<font color="yellow">The sky was very pretty and blue.</font>

88
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:16,440
<font color="yellow">If I had died, I would not have been able
to see this pretty sky.</font>

89
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,560
<font color="yellow">Since the weather is nice, our first
filming is going to be amazing.</font>

90
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,209
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought.</font>

91
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:27,313
<font color="yellow">Our Writer Lee is okay.
She is joking around again.</font>

92
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:30,603
<font color="yellow">Director Yoon, filming will be over
before dark right?</font>

93
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:34,444
<font color="yellow">- Hye Sung has to go to China today.
- Why is he going to China?</font>

94
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:39,482
<font color="yellow">China's best Media Group President
sent a special invitation to Hye Sung.</font>

95
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:43,004
<font color="yellow">The President's daughter is Ms. China.</font>

96
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:46,421
<font color="yellow">I heard she likes our Hye Sung very much.</font>

97
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,313
<font color="yellow">I will be there for just a day.</font>

98
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,897
<font color="yellow">I will be back before the next filming
in two days.</font>

99
00:09:49,897 --> 00:09:53,610
<font color="yellow">We have no problem with that then.</font>

100
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,770
<font color="yellow">- Hurry and go.
- Okay.</font>

101
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,338
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

102
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:00,104
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

103
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:43,463
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Are you okay? Did you get hurt?</font>

104
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:49,483
<font color="yellow">Oh my. What should we do?
Hye Sung, hold on. Excuse me!</font>

105
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,425
<font color="yellow">I fooled you, right?</font>

106
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,467
<font color="yellow">Do you still think I'm "foot acting?"</font>

107
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:05,616
<font color="yellow">You scared me. What should I do with you?</font>

108
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:08,147
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting your lifesaver?
You should thank me...</font>

109
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,718
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

110
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:11,557
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee.</font>

111
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:16,008
<font color="yellow">- You are going to see me filming, right?
- Of course.</font>

112
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,033
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do all my scenes myself.
No stuntman.</font>

113
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:20,541
<font color="yellow">Keep an eye on me.</font>

114
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:24,275
<font color="yellow">Hye Sung. You were amazing.</font>

115
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:27,406
<font color="yellow">You guys say that every day.
I'm getting tired of it.</font>

116
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:31,459
<font color="yellow">I said I'm okay.</font>

117
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:35,502
<font color="yellow">Let's start filming. Standby.</font>

118
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:38,729
<font color="yellow">- Be careful.
- Okay.</font>

119
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:41,031
<font color="yellow">Ready.</font>

120
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:42,713
<font color="yellow">Action.</font>

121
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,430
<font color="yellow">Looking at it from here,
out at the set</font>

122
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,762
<font color="yellow">it was a great idea to
become a writer, right?</font>

123
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:22,651
<font color="yellow">Yes. My heart is full.</font>

124
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:26,127
<font color="yellow">Whenever you get a chance,
come out to the set and look.</font>

125
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:29,675
<font color="yellow">You will get fresh ideas and
you will feel more responsible.</font>

126
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,344
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

127
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,032
<font color="yellow"><i>Going on a date. Please pick my clothes.</i></font>

128

<font color="yellow"><i>Do you want to get dumped?</i></font>

129
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,989
<font color="yellow"><i>- Please tell me I just didn't see that.
- This is terrible. Forget it.</i></font>

130
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,127
<font color="yellow"><i>There must be a right answer to this
multiple choice. But I don't see one.</i></font>

131
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:47,166
<font color="yellow"><i>You will get dumped 100 percent.
You could get slapped too.</i></font>

132
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,210
<font color="yellow"><i>- Get rid of that belt.
- I can't take this anymore. Stop it.</i></font>

133
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,007
<font color="yellow"><i>God, please save him.</i></font>

134
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:54,311
<font color="yellow"><i>Did he really pay for those clothes?</i></font>

135
00:14:05,374 --> 00:14:08,482
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's going to rain in the evening.</font>

136
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:30,316
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Did you not see
a motorcycle parked here?</font>

137
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:33,336
<font color="yellow">Oh, that motorcycle? Follow me.</font>

138
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,290
<font color="yellow">Why is this here?</font>

139
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,170
<font color="yellow">Oh, well...
I heard it was going to rain today.</font>

140
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,739
<font color="yellow">It could get rained on.</font>

141
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:50,753
<font color="yellow">Since this is not mine.
I'm keeping it for you.</font>

142
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,254
<font color="yellow">Oh. I should have asked
for your permission.</font>

143
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,836
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

144
00:15:02,063 --> 00:15:03,730
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

145
00:15:05,725 --> 00:15:08,463
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm just laughing.</font>

146
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:14,398
<font color="yellow">You have a kind heart.</font>

147
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,052
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

148
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,896
<font color="yellow">You have a pretty smile.</font>

149
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:24,621
<font color="yellow">I'm very thankful, but I'm causing you
too much trouble.</font>

150
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,204
<font color="yellow">I will move it somewhere else.</font>

151
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:32,767
<font color="yellow">What? No, no, no. You can't do that.</font>

152
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:36,302
<font color="yellow">I already paid the parking fee.</font>

153
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,680
<font color="yellow">If we leave that spot empty,
we are wasting money.</font>

154
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,830
<font color="yellow">And the guard will be disappointed.</font>

155
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,642
<font color="yellow">There's a high chance that
it will cause illegal dumping.</font>

156
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,090
<font color="yellow">It will be monsoon season soon.
Are you going to keep it here?</font>

157
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,612
<font color="yellow">- It will be inconvenient for you.
- Oh.</font>

158
00:15:48,612 --> 00:15:52,363
<font color="yellow">I bought a waterproof cover for
the motorcycle.</font>

159
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:55,695
<font color="yellow">It is the "rocket delivery," so
it will be here tomorrow at the latest.</font>

160
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:57,901
<font color="yellow">How much was it? I will pay for
the waterproof cover--</font>

161
00:15:57,901 --> 00:16:00,613
<font color="yellow">That's okay. Instead...</font>

162
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,228
<font color="yellow">I would be very thankful
if you could give me a ride.</font>

163
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:18,575
<font color="yellow">Your cell phone.</font>

164
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:21,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. Here.</font>

165
00:16:24,013 --> 00:16:26,749
<font color="yellow">You look way younger than me.
Is it okay if speak down to you?</font>

166
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,710
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, sure.</font>

167
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,599
<font color="yellow">I'll text you for a quick ride soon.</font>

168
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:36,047
<font color="yellow">A quick ride. Wow.</font>

169
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:37,592
<font color="yellow">I like that. A quick ride.</font>

170
00:16:37,592 --> 00:16:39,152
<font color="yellow">Then I will get going.</font>

171
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:43,195
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's going to rain today.
Take an umbrella...</font>

172
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,892
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

173
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,901
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's keep it down.
Are you the only one living here?</i></font>

174
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,151
<font color="yellow">He scared me. Wow.</font>

175
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:03,329
<font color="yellow">He's a funny guy.</font>

176
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,824
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
<i>- Where are you?</i></font>

177
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,062
<font color="yellow"><i>Mom told you to hurry
and unclog the toilet.</i></font>

178
00:17:16,062 --> 00:17:18,005
<font color="yellow">Did you call me to say that?</font>

179
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:21,371
<font color="yellow">Everyone is going to Jeju today.
Including Mother.</font>

180
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:24,098
<font color="yellow">Hurry and go home. Start packing
and unclog the toilet.</font>

181
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:26,205
<font color="yellow"><i>Mother doesn't like
strangers visiting our house.</i></font>

182
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,934
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

183
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,691
<font color="yellow">A quick ride.</font>

184
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,940
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee.</font>

185
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,769
<font color="yellow">I called a cab.</font>

186
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:23,360
<font color="yellow">- Can you really go alone?
- It's okay.</font>

187
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,257
<font color="yellow">I have some things to think about.
And I will finish writing Episode 11.</font>

188
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,490
<font color="yellow">Did you find a place to stay?</font>

189
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,508
<font color="yellow">Yes, I found one. There's a cabin
I stayed at the last time I was here.</font>

190
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:34,901
<font color="yellow">Okay. Call me if you need anything.</font>

191
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:36,793
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

192
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:41,140
<font color="yellow"><i>[Dr. Hong]</i></font>

193
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:48,835
<font color="yellow">I waxed.</font>

194
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:51,888
<font color="yellow">Waxing. Brazilian waxing.</font>

195
00:18:51,888 --> 00:18:54,155
<font color="yellow">- Do you want to date me?
- Why are you not answering?</font>

196
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:59,023
<font color="yellow">- Did I just get dumped?
- Can't you just date me "Brother?"</font>

197
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:02,440
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is right here.</font>

198
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:06,069
<font color="yellow">It's Dr. Hong Joon Ki.</font>

199
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:14,630
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dr. Hong. I'm in Pyeongchang.</font>

200
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,558
<font color="yellow">I was going to give you a lecture,
but you are too far away.</font>

201
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:20,575
<font color="yellow">Oh. We had to do a ritual ceremony
for our drama.</font>

202
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,152
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't have a hangover.
That's a relief.</font>

203
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:25,735
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

204
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:27,777
<font color="yellow">Then are you coming back tonight?</font>

205
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:30,432
<font color="yellow">No, I'm going to take a break here.</font>

206
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:32,305
<font color="yellow">That's nice.</font>

207
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,891
<font color="yellow">Eat delicious food, and don't forget to
take your medicine.</font>

208
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,409
<font color="yellow">If you are not feeling well,
call me whenever.</font>

209
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,438
<font color="yellow">Okay, thank you.</font>

210
00:19:42,626 --> 00:19:46,200
<font color="yellow">Oh, Dr. Hong is very enthusiastic.</font>

211
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,958
<font color="yellow">What did he say?
Did he ask you out on a date?</font>

212
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,776
<font color="yellow">Stop it.
I'm not going to take it anymore.</font>

213
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:52,557
<font color="yellow">I will get going.</font>

214
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:34,417
<font color="yellow">Cut. Okay.</font>

215
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:38,200
<font color="yellow">Thanks for the hard work, Director Yoon.</font>

216
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,160
<font color="yellow">Actor Ryu, you are doing great today.</font>

217
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,686
<font color="yellow">Keep doing what you are doing.</font>

218
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:55,795
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung. Thanks for the hard work today.
You were amazing.</font>

219
00:20:55,795 --> 00:21:00,682
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that was nothing.</font>

220
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,912
<font color="yellow">Well. Where is Writer So Hye?</font>

221
00:21:02,912 --> 00:21:06,026
<font color="yellow">She said she has a cabin
that she used to go to.</font>

222
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,563
<font color="yellow">She will be writing her script there.</font>

223
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:08,967
<font color="yellow">A cabin...</font>

224
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,748
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Let's hurry and go.</font>

225
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:15,139
<font color="yellow">We have to go straight to the airport.</font>

226
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,679
<font color="yellow">CEO Choi is making a fuss.
She wants us to leave quickly.</font>

227
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,225
<font color="yellow">- Okay. See you later, Writer Sang Hwa.
- Okay.</font>

228
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:28,101
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is this? The actor is acting
so hard and she is not even here.</font>

229
00:21:28,101 --> 00:21:31,486
<font color="yellow">Why was she in a hurry?
Why would she go to the cabin alone?</font>

230
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:33,536
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for Writer Lee?</font>

231
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:35,904
<font color="yellow">You are hiding something, right?</font>

232
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:38,305
<font color="yellow">I already told you no.</font>

233
00:21:40,123 --> 00:21:42,298
<font color="yellow">Who are you looking at?</font>

234
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:46,450
<font color="yellow"><i>I'm standing here,
right in front of you.</i></font>

235
00:22:37,863 --> 00:22:39,575
<font color="yellow">What the!</font>

236
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:43,661
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

237
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:46,508
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he never gives me a break.</font>

238
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:53,900
<font color="yellow">Are you going to the cabin?</font>

239
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,614
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- What should we do?</font>

240
00:22:56,614 --> 00:22:58,450
<font color="yellow">Our cabin is under construction
until tomorrow.</font>

241
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,055
<font color="yellow">Oh, really?</font>

242
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,515
<font color="yellow">- Well...
- Let's just go in.</font>

243
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:06,121
<font color="yellow">You came all the way here.
The room in the front is all done.</font>

244
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:08,537
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

245
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,910
<font color="yellow">Why do I have nothing to wear?</font>

246
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,701
<font color="yellow">I should have gone shopping today.</font>

247
00:24:08,701 --> 00:24:10,446
<font color="yellow">Just wear hanbok.</font>

248
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:14,390
<font color="yellow">Reporters will be there too. If they take
pictures of you wearing luxury goods...</font>

249
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,125
<font color="yellow">- it will cause a ruckus.
- It's a bazaar on the Jeju beach.</font>

250
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:19,577
<font color="yellow">- Hanbok doesn't seem right.
- I don't like seeing middle-aged women</font>

251
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:23,276
<font color="yellow">with bellies walking around
in tight clothes.</font>

252
00:24:23,276 --> 00:24:25,222
<font color="yellow">This could cover my belly.
What do you think?</font>

253
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:28,112
<font color="yellow">- Are you ready?
- What should I wear?</font>

254
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:31,341
<font color="yellow">- Should I wear hanbok?
- You should wear hanbok.</font>

255
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:34,164
<font color="yellow">- Why are you not getting ready?
- Are you crazy?</font>

256
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,401
<font color="yellow">How could you take her
to a place like that?</font>

257
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:38,921
<font color="yellow">It's a bazaar that all the former and
present political officials go to.</font>

258
00:24:38,921 --> 00:24:40,439
<font color="yellow">Do you want them to
make fun of our family?</font>

259
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,591
<font color="yellow">But everyone is coming with their spouse.</font>

260
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,174
<font color="yellow">You are going to escort Lee Hyo Won.</font>

261
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:45,757
<font color="yellow">It will look awkward
if you bring her along.</font>

262
00:24:45,757 --> 00:24:47,259
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

263
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:50,863
<font color="yellow">This is an important gathering.
Do you want to ruin everything?</font>

264
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:55,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, fold it so that
it won't get wrinkled.</font>

265
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,322
<font color="yellow">The skirt and the accessories. Don't
leave anything out. Put everything back.</font>

266
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:02,228
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Mom.</font>

267
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:04,332
<font color="yellow">Don't wear a diamond ring.
Wear a pearl ring.</font>

268
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:09,725
<font color="yellow">Will you be okay?</font>

269
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:13,217
<font color="yellow">I don't want to follow you guys at all.</font>

270
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:16,437
<font color="yellow">Just leave.
Don't make me more miserable.</font>

271
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:18,317
<font color="yellow">Yes, Auntie.</font>

272
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:22,392
<font color="yellow">Attorney Choi's dress code? It's navy.</font>

273
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:27,027
<font color="yellow">She should wear navy too.
You guys should dress like a couple.</font>

274
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:31,447
<font color="yellow">I want to go too. It has been
a while since I have been to Jeju.</font>

275
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,322
<font color="yellow">Please take good care
of our Attorney Choi.</font>

276
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:36,034
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

277
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,783
<font color="yellow">Be nice to Assemblywoman Lee.
Buy her a drink tonight.</font>

278
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:45,526
<font color="yellow">- Do you need my credit card?
- Forget it. You buy her a drink.</font>

279
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:49,052
<font color="yellow">I can't go to Jeju. I'm going on
a business trip to China.</font>

280
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:50,796
<font color="yellow">You packed my travel bag too, right?</font>

281
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:53,324
<font color="yellow">- Bring it out.
- Okay, Jin Sook.</font>

282
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,630
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Nothing will happen
even if I go there.</font>

283
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,485
<font color="yellow">I'm just doing my business.</font>

284
00:26:00,485 --> 00:26:03,553
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want.
I don't care.</font>

285
00:26:16,315 --> 00:26:17,920
<font color="yellow">Get my shoes too.</font>

286
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:26,980
<font color="yellow">Mom, drop me off at my office.</font>

287
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,710
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

288
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:35,452
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

289
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:42,268
<font color="yellow">You are holding onto it for too long.
Get over it.</font>

290
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,555
<font color="yellow">Go out and eat something delicious.</font>

291
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:46,267
<font color="yellow">Why are you not coming--</font>

292
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,883
<font color="yellow">- You're going to spoil her.
- Jin Sook.</font>

293
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:54,966
<font color="yellow">Don't wander around.
Pick her up on time from the tutor.</font>

294
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:57,653
<font color="yellow">Okay? Come now.</font>

295
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:38,241
<font color="yellow">Mi Sun. What are you doing today?
Are you busy?</font>

296
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,399
<font color="yellow">Why does it have to be today?</font>

297
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,054
<font color="yellow">It's my mother-in-law's birthday.</font>

298
00:27:43,054 --> 00:27:45,989
<font color="yellow">Who is it? The Snow White?</font>

299
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,490
<font color="yellow">What? That's not even funny.
That bitch.</font>

300
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:52,554
<font color="yellow">Your sister-in-law is hilarious.</font>

301
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:55,548
<font color="yellow">Why does she want you to
pick her daughter up?</font>

302
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:59,671
<font color="yellow">Hey, send her here.
I will make her bald.</font>

303
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:02,036
<font color="yellow"><i>Be gentle. You might pull my hair off.</i></font>

304
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:07,100
<font color="yellow">This is disappointing.
It's so hard for you to make time.</font>

305
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,979
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

306
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,990
<font color="yellow">So Hye is away too.</font>

307
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,601
<font color="yellow">- Hey Seol, Seol.
- Oh, Pil.</font>

308
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,177
<font color="yellow">I heard you guys are
still very much in love.</font>

309
00:28:18,177 --> 00:28:20,176
<font color="yellow">Totally.</font>

310
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,917
<font color="yellow">But I'm not as good as I used to be.</font>

311
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:25,545
<font color="yellow">She is taking all my energy away.
I'm getting weak.</font>

312
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,840
<font color="yellow">I envy you guys.</font>

313
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,875
<font color="yellow">Okay, see you next time.</font>

314
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,817
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

315
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,536
<font color="yellow"><i>A quick ride now?</i></font>

316
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,232
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

317
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:20,902
<font color="yellow"><i>Let's go.</i></font>

318
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:26,556
<font color="yellow"><i>I will be there in 20 minutes.
Get ready.</i></font>

319
00:29:27,753 --> 00:29:29,334
<font color="yellow"><i>Yes, sir!</i></font>

320
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:15,677
<font color="yellow">That had to hurt.</font>

321
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,229
<font color="yellow">What do we do?</font>

322
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,978
<font color="yellow"><i>- Gosh.
- Gosh.</i></font>

323
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:31,847
<font color="yellow"><i>You are still very humorous.</i></font>

324
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:37,861
<font color="yellow"><i>Our Writer Lee is napping too long.</i></font>

325
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:41,669
<font color="yellow"><i>You won't sleep at night then.
Get up. Okay?</i></font>

326
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,495
<font color="yellow">You got up?</font>

327
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:52,027
<font color="yellow">No wonder you looked familiar.</font>

328
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:54,133
<font color="yellow">I can recognize her now.</font>

329
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:56,283
<font color="yellow">Come here and eat some watermelon.</font>

330
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:58,834
<font color="yellow">That's right. She didn't change a bit.</font>

331
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,390
<font color="yellow">She looks the same.</font>

332
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,074
<font color="yellow">You should have told us earlier.</font>

333
00:31:05,074 --> 00:31:06,773
<font color="yellow">- Come here.
- Please come here.</font>

334
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,738
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you were going to China?</font>

335
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,342
<font color="yellow">Oh, that trip?</font>

336
00:31:21,342 --> 00:31:23,970
<font color="yellow">I canceled it. I'm tired.</font>

337
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,161
<font color="yellow">Since I'm here, I came to visit them.</font>

338
00:31:26,161 --> 00:31:30,084
<font color="yellow">I really didn't think that
you would be here.</font>

339
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:33,097
<font color="yellow">Hye Sung came here once every year.</font>

340
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:34,948
<font color="yellow">That's why there was a panel of him
by the entrance.</font>

341
00:31:34,948 --> 00:31:37,150
<font color="yellow">After Hye Sung's fan club visited here</font>

342
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,649
<font color="yellow">his fans from China visit here often.</font>

343
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,890
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Hye Sung, we make a living.</font>

344
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,315
<font color="yellow">That's because this is a good place.
It's not because of me.</font>

345
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,995
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

346
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,383
<font color="yellow">You guys must be hungry.
Go get some lettuce.</font>

347
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:54,053
<font color="yellow">I will cook some meat for you guys.</font>

348
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:58,702
<font color="yellow">Lettuce. You know I'm good at that.</font>

349
00:31:58,702 --> 00:32:01,469
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. Hurry.
- What?</font>

350
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:10,151
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

351
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:11,678
<font color="yellow">They have some fresh lettuce, right?</font>

352
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:13,966
<font color="yellow">They are all my kids.</font>

353
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:17,825
<font color="yellow">- I sowed the seeds.
- No way.</font>

354
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:23,385
<font color="yellow">He came here with his grandmother
and planted them all.</font>

355
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:26,086
<font color="yellow">It was very nice to see his grandmother
and him together.</font>

356
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:29,885
<font color="yellow">If I had a daughter, I would love to
have him as my son-in-law.</font>

357
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:31,938
<font color="yellow">He would be the perfect husband.</font>

358
00:32:31,938 --> 00:32:33,605
<font color="yellow">Right?</font>

359
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,808
<font color="yellow">Oh, and get some chili peppers too.</font>

360
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:39,335
<font color="yellow">Pick large ones.</font>

361
00:32:46,661 --> 00:32:49,575
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Do you think CEO Choi
is going to leave you alone?</font>

362
00:32:49,575 --> 00:32:51,633
<font color="yellow">Just tell her my depression came back
and I got off the grid.</font>

363
00:32:51,633 --> 00:32:53,193
<font color="yellow">Disappeared to where?</font>

364
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:56,307
<font color="yellow">If you tell her that, how is that
getting off the grid?</font>

365
00:32:56,307 --> 00:33:01,074
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know this?
You are going to see Writer Lee, right?</font>

366
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:02,969
<font color="yellow">- Can't you trust me?
- You are making me not to trust you.</font>

367
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,565
<font color="yellow">- Chang Seok.
- Forget it. Go.</font>

368
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:07,128
<font color="yellow">Go. Go!</font>

369
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,344
<font color="yellow">You go.</font>

370
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,520
<font color="yellow">I need the car too.</font>

371
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:21,542
<font color="yellow">You will be there. You are coming, right?</font>

372
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:24,327
<font color="yellow">You are going to come late, right?</font>

373
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,200
<font color="yellow">I trust you.</font>

374
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,623
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything. Keep it shut.</font>

375
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:41,565
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm your man!</font>

376
00:33:41,565 --> 00:33:44,210
<font color="yellow">Go!</font>

377
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,097
<font color="yellow">Go.</font>

378
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,133
<font color="yellow">Hurry and come here.
The meat is burning.</font>

379
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,697
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

380
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:02,207
<font color="yellow">This place is like the Holy Land
to motorcyclists.</font>

381
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:05,890
<font color="yellow">They have good food, and they sell
motorcycle gear and clothes.</font>

382
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,471
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

383
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:15,734
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

384
00:35:15,734 --> 00:35:17,346
<font color="yellow"><i>[Notice: Closed three days
for summer vacation.]</i></font>

385
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:19,669
<font color="yellow">Who goes on vacation in September?</font>

386
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:22,343
<font color="yellow">They do.</font>

387
00:35:22,343 --> 00:35:25,259
<font color="yellow">I knew this might happen.
I searched for another place.</font>

388
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,826
<font color="yellow"><i>[We are going out of business.
Thank you for being our loyal customer.]</i></font>

389
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,567
<font color="yellow">I have one more place to go.
It's a really good place.</font>

390
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,640
<font color="yellow">I was going to take you there once
we got to know each other more.</font>

391
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,993
<font color="yellow">It's the most popular place. Let's go.</font>

392
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:09,734
<font color="yellow">- Should I drive?
- That's okay.</font>

393
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:36,395
<font color="yellow">The address is...</font>

394
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:38,939
<font color="yellow">This is the right address.</font>

395
00:36:38,939 --> 00:36:41,132
<font color="yellow">When did it change?</font>

396
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,446
<font color="yellow">Oh, please don't misunderstand me.</font>

397
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:47,446
<font color="yellow">This place had so many good reviews.
It was the place to go on a date.</font>

398
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:50,484
<font color="yellow">So I... Gosh.</font>

399
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:53,573
<font color="yellow">Hop on.</font>

400
00:37:08,343 --> 00:37:10,993
<font color="yellow">It's very delicious.</font>

401
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:13,658
<font color="yellow">This was not my plan.</font>

402
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:18,730
<font color="yellow">Why? It's the most delicious food
I've had in the past year.</font>

403
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,377
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

404
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,332
<font color="yellow">Still.</font>

405
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:27,656
<font color="yellow">The weather is nice today.</font>

406
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,426
<font color="yellow">And the air is fresh too.</font>

407
00:37:32,455 --> 00:37:34,270
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

408
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,995
<font color="yellow">- What's your blood type?
- Type O.</font>

409
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:40,399
<font color="yellow">I'm type A.</font>

410
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:43,613
<font color="yellow">- So what?
- Well.</font>

411
00:37:43,613 --> 00:37:48,105
<font color="yellow">I heard Type A and Type O people
get along easily.</font>

412
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:56,665
<font color="yellow">What's your sign?</font>

413
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:00,015
<font color="yellow">Are you going to check our signs too?</font>

414
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:03,261
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's just for fun.
I was just curious.</font>

415
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,486
<font color="yellow">Here you go. Aren't you going
to read my palm?</font>

416
00:38:10,486 --> 00:38:12,393
<font color="yellow">Oh, okay.</font>

417
00:38:16,618 --> 00:38:19,614
<font color="yellow">So this means...</font>

418
00:38:19,614 --> 00:38:22,372
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I don't know how
to read palms. I haven't study that yet.</font>

419
00:38:27,944 --> 00:38:30,681
<font color="yellow">What's your ideal type?</font>

420
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,194
<font color="yellow">My ideal type?</font>

421
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:41,638
<font color="yellow">I'm okay as long as
the person is not an attorney.</font>

422
00:38:41,638 --> 00:38:43,825
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

423
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,509
<font color="yellow">Oh... Why?</font>

424
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:49,652
<font color="yellow">Why do you not like attorneys?
It's a great occupation.</font>

425
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:52,471
<font color="yellow">- I just don't like them.
- Were you treated unfairly--</font>

426
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:55,100
<font color="yellow">Stop. That's enough.</font>

427
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,151
<font color="yellow">You will get hurt
if you get to know too much about me.</font>

428
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,167
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you just one more thing.</font>

429
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:03,794
<font color="yellow">What is your name?</font>

430
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:05,681
<font color="yellow">- "Older Sister."
- Gosh.</font>

431
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:09,511
<font color="yellow">We should get to know each other.
I'm Kim--</font>

432
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:11,444
<font color="yellow">You are a "Younger Brother."</font>

433
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:13,393
<font color="yellow">Let's just be a brother and a sister.</font>

434
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:18,118
<font color="yellow">Don't ask about each other's personal
life. Let's just be riding friends.</font>

435
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:19,730
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

436
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,705
<font color="yellow">If you don't like that, I will move
my motorcycle to a new spot.</font>

437
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:26,272
<font color="yellow">No. I like that. Good.</font>

438
00:39:26,754 --> 00:39:28,332
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

439
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:33,279
<font color="yellow">- Let's get going.
- Already?</font>

440
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:35,011
<font color="yellow">I still have a lot of ramen left.</font>

441
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:40,018
<font color="yellow">This... Wait.</font>

442
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:43,402
<font color="yellow">Then did you guys meet after 10 years?</font>

443
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:49,964
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Why did you guys not keep in touch?</font>

444
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:54,372
<font color="yellow">- Did you guys fight?
- Gosh. Why would you ask such a thing?</font>

445
00:39:54,372 --> 00:39:56,439
<font color="yellow">They are together now.
That's what counts.</font>

446
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,038
<font color="yellow">But I'm curious.</font>

447
00:39:58,038 --> 00:40:00,511
<font color="yellow">Writer Lee is
the perfect person for you.</font>

448
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,660
<font color="yellow">Why did you only bring "cutie" here?</font>

449
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,620
<font color="yellow">Cutie?</font>

450
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,152
<font color="yellow">Oh, there's someone. Cutie.</font>

451
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:12,506
<font color="yellow">Gray-haired cutie.</font>

452
00:40:12,506 --> 00:40:15,986
<font color="yellow">- Hae Sung's grandmother.
- Oh.</font>

453
00:40:15,986 --> 00:40:18,357
<font color="yellow">Honey, stop that.</font>

454
00:40:18,357 --> 00:40:20,977
<font color="yellow">Look at that sky.</font>

455
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:23,540
<font color="yellow">Finish your meals and
go look at the stars.</font>

456
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,122
<font color="yellow">Take a ride in the open car.</font>

457
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,181
<font color="yellow">- Open car?
- Sure.</font>

458
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:28,790
<font color="yellow">You can play harmonica on your way there.</font>

459
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,051
<font color="yellow">It's the special route that
we discovered.</font>

460
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:33,529
<font color="yellow">- You will regret it if you miss it.
- That's right.</font>

461
00:40:33,529 --> 00:40:35,700
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Hurry and eat.</font>

462
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,406
<font color="yellow">Is that the "open car?"</font>

463
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,971
<font color="yellow">Is that the "open car?"</font>

464
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:48,745
<font color="yellow">It is the open car.</font>

465
00:40:48,745 --> 00:40:50,270
<font color="yellow">Then where is the harmonica?</font>

466
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:53,520
<font color="yellow">By the time you finish this,
you will be on the top of the mountain.</font>

467
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,435
<font color="yellow">Go get a lot of stars.</font>

468
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:15,888
<font color="yellow">- Do you like it?
- Huh?</font>

469
00:41:15,888 --> 00:41:19,082
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Let's go.</font>

470
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:35,997
<font color="yellow">Why is this not working again?</font>

471
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,995
<font color="yellow">Jeez.</font>

472
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:40,272
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

473
00:41:40,272 --> 00:41:41,817
<font color="yellow">Did the tire pop?</font>

474
00:41:41,817 --> 00:41:45,741
<font color="yellow">It has been like this since this morning.
And it finally popped.</font>

475
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:47,705
<font color="yellow">What do we do then? Can't you fix it?</font>

476
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,024
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

477
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:58,113
<font color="yellow">Jeez. I left my tools.</font>

478
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:01,078
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Stay here for just a while.</font>

479
00:42:01,078 --> 00:42:05,256
<font color="yellow">Look at the stars. I will go down and
bring the tools. I will be back soon.</font>

480
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:21,428
<font color="yellow">What about the car key?</font>

481
00:42:21,428 --> 00:42:24,080
<font color="yellow">I took it out of there.</font>

482
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,663
<font color="yellow">You put some drinks and
a blanket there too, right?</font>

483
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:29,064
<font color="yellow">I left them wine glasses
and some food too.</font>

484
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:33,102
<font color="yellow">- Good job.
- We did everything we can do.</font>

485
00:42:33,993 --> 00:42:37,256
<font color="yellow">If he still can't tell her
that he likes her</font>

486
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:39,468
<font color="yellow">he is not a man.</font>

487
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,814
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- Let's go.</font>

488
00:42:55,598 --> 00:42:57,410
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

489
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:06,446
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

490
00:43:06,446 --> 00:43:09,071
<font color="yellow">I heard they have bears here.</font>

491
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:11,035
<font color="yellow">- Really?
- Yes.</font>

492
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:16,361
<font color="yellow">- Look at that!
- What? Why?</font>

493
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:22,098
<font color="yellow">You scared me!</font>

494
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,111
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

495
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:28,643
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

496
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,656
<font color="yellow">- By the way...
- By the way...</font>

497
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:05,622
<font color="yellow">- You can say it first.
- You go ahead.</font>

498
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:13,227
<font color="yellow">Today on the mountain...</font>

499
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:14,864
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

500
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,788
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

501
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:24,437
<font color="yellow">We're at a high altitude.
I can't hear you.</font>

502
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:32,578
<font color="yellow">Thank you for...
saving me.</font>

503
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:37,234
<font color="yellow">I was very remorseful.</font>

504
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,777
<font color="yellow">A lot.</font>

505
00:46:43,777 --> 00:46:47,814
<font color="yellow">For a long time.</font>

506
00:46:47,814 --> 00:46:49,413
<font color="yellow">Every day.</font>

507
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,776
<font color="yellow">Back then, I didn't know how important
of a decision that was.</font>

508
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:11,053
<font color="yellow">If I knew that things would turn out
like this because of that decision...</font>

509
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:17,629
<font color="yellow">If...</font>

510
00:47:20,158 --> 00:47:22,158
<font color="yellow">I could go back...</font>

511
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,401
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have made that choice.</font>

512
00:47:29,401 --> 00:47:31,098
<font color="yellow">Never.</font>

513
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:02,960
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

514
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,837
<font color="yellow">- No, I mean "roger"
- Hae Sung, It's me.</font>

515
00:48:06,837 --> 00:48:11,178
<font color="yellow">We have a guest here.</font>

516
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:15,535
<font color="yellow">- A guest?
- He said he is Writer Lee's friend.</font>

517
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:17,850
<font color="yellow">- What did you say your name is?
- I'm Hong Joon Ki.</font>

518
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,902
<font color="yellow"><i>Hong Joon Ki?</i></font>

519
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:22,491
<font color="yellow">- He said he is Hong Joon Ki.
- What?</font>

520
00:48:22,491 --> 00:48:24,158
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

521
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:27,736
<font color="yellow">What? Who? Dr. Hong Joon Ki is here?</font>

522
00:48:27,736 --> 00:48:31,489
<font color="yellow">Well. Press this and talk.</font>

523
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,046
<font color="yellow">Where are you, Writer Lee?</font>

524
00:48:34,046 --> 00:48:37,314
<font color="yellow">Well. Oh, yes...</font>

525
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,109
<font color="yellow">I'm up on the mountain. To watch stars...</font>

526
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:43,218
<font color="yellow">Did you go night hiking?</font>

527
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:44,781
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

528
00:48:44,781 --> 00:48:47,631
<font color="yellow">Take your time. I'll be waiting for you.</font>

529
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:49,187
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

530
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:55,310
<font color="yellow">I will be there soon. Hold on.</font>

531
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,350
<font color="yellow">What is this? How did he come here?</font>

532
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,747
<font color="yellow">Who is he?</font>

533
00:49:00,747 --> 00:49:03,127
<font color="yellow">You are all by yourself.
Who would come to the cabin?</font>

534
00:49:03,127 --> 00:49:06,187
<font color="yellow">He is a doctor and
an adviser for our drama.</font>

535
00:49:06,187 --> 00:49:07,902
<font color="yellow">Why would an adviser come here?</font>

536
00:49:07,902 --> 00:49:09,442
<font color="yellow">Isn't he a fake doctor?</font>

537
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:12,189
<font color="yellow">You said you are going to work on your
script. Why did you call a doctor?</font>

538
00:49:12,189 --> 00:49:13,975
<font color="yellow">Are you sick?</font>

539
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:15,933
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I'm sick?</font>

540
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:18,214
<font color="yellow">Why would he come here then?</font>

541
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:56,825
<font color="yellow">How did you come here?</font>

542
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:59,417
<font color="yellow">Writer Sang Hwa gave me a special tip.</font>

543
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:02,247
<font color="yellow">I have something to give you.
And I wanted to refresh myself.</font>

544
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:09,180
<font color="yellow">Oh, this is Ryu Hye Sung.</font>

545
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,022
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

546
00:50:11,022 --> 00:50:13,698
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

547
00:50:13,698 --> 00:50:18,002
<font color="yellow">- He is the main character of our drama.
- Oh.</font>

548
00:50:18,002 --> 00:50:22,114
<font color="yellow">Nice to meet you. I'm Hong Joon Ki.</font>

549
00:50:22,114 --> 00:50:24,843
<font color="yellow">Do you not know me?</font>

550
00:50:24,843 --> 00:50:27,049
<font color="yellow">I don't really watch TV.</font>

551
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:28,613
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry that I couldn't recognize you.</font>

552
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,243
<font color="yellow">You are kidding, right?</font>

553
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:35,848
<font color="yellow">- Do you really not know me?
- No.</font>

554
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:38,312
<font color="yellow">I guess he only stays at home.</font>

555
00:50:38,312 --> 00:50:41,064
<font color="yellow">My pictures are everywhere on the street.</font>

556
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:48,493
<font color="yellow">- Can we talk for a minute?
- Yes.</font>

557
00:51:10,538 --> 00:51:13,223
<font color="yellow">I just had to make a visit
because of this spoiled patient.</font>

558
00:51:13,223 --> 00:51:16,218
<font color="yellow">I'm really okay.
Sang Hwa shouldn't have done that.</font>

559
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:21,122
<font color="yellow">What is he putting his hand on?</font>

560
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:28,531
<font color="yellow">It's okay. Your patient had an emergency.
Your patient seems more urgent.</font>

561
00:51:28,531 --> 00:51:30,122
<font color="yellow">Take one now.</font>

562
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:38,055
<font color="yellow">Then that jerk...</font>

563
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:46,239
<font color="yellow">Hong Joon Ki.</font>

564
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,149
<font color="yellow">- Doctor.
- Yes?</font>

565
00:51:49,149 --> 00:51:51,817
<font color="yellow">You should come here.
I'm sure you didn't eat dinner.</font>

566
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,029
<font color="yellow">Let's have a BBQ party.</font>

567
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:58,573
<font color="yellow">- Oh, okay.
- Let's do that.</font>

568
00:52:01,268 --> 00:52:02,774
<font color="yellow">Here, Dr. Hong.</font>

569
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:21,497
<font color="yellow">So you are a doctor?</font>

570
00:52:21,497 --> 00:52:24,982
<font color="yellow">Yes. I work at the Sungdong Hospital.</font>

571
00:52:24,982 --> 00:52:28,785
<font color="yellow">You don't own a hospital.</font>

572
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:31,931
<font color="yellow">So you take a paycheck home.</font>

573
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,745
<font color="yellow">He's the Director of the Hospital.</font>

574
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:38,805
<font color="yellow">Sungdong Hospital...</font>

575
00:52:38,805 --> 00:52:42,143
<font color="yellow">That Medical Center...</font>

576
00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:44,647
<font color="yellow">You are "high-class" then.</font>

577
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:48,151
<font color="yellow">No, that's not it.</font>

578
00:52:48,151 --> 00:52:51,957
<font color="yellow">Celebrities are high-class these days.</font>

579
00:52:51,957 --> 00:52:54,352
<font color="yellow">He helps elders who are homeless.</font>

580
00:52:54,352 --> 00:52:56,919
<font color="yellow">He does a lot of charity work.</font>

581
00:52:56,919 --> 00:53:00,062
<font color="yellow">Hae Sung donates a lot</font>

582
00:53:00,062 --> 00:53:02,390
<font color="yellow">whenever there is
a huge earthquake or a flood.</font>

583
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,569
<font color="yellow">That's nothing. That's what I should do.</font>

584
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:09,488
<font color="yellow">Here. We have more beef.</font>

585
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:16,504
<font color="yellow">You should eat some.
We had dinner already.</font>

586
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:19,502
<font color="yellow">- Here.
- Thank you.</font>

587
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:21,152
<font color="yellow">Give me one too.</font>

588
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:27,567
<font color="yellow">- You should eat too.
- Okay.</font>

589
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:35,109
<font color="yellow">Let me have a lettuce. A lettuce.</font>

590
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,303
<font color="yellow">Eat this one.</font>

591
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,042
<font color="yellow">One more.</font>

592
00:54:00,332 --> 00:54:02,968
<font color="yellow">- Go inside.
- Okay.</font>

593
00:54:02,968 --> 00:54:06,024
<font color="yellow">- When should we meet next...
- Next time?</font>

594
00:54:06,024 --> 00:54:08,794
<font color="yellow">We should go to the places
we couldn't go today.</font>

595
00:54:08,794 --> 00:54:11,486
<font color="yellow">Ms. Older Sister.</font>

596
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:13,502
<font color="yellow">Ms. Older Sister?</font>

597
00:54:13,502 --> 00:54:15,281
<font color="yellow">You said your name is Older Sister.</font>

598
00:54:15,281 --> 00:54:18,368
<font color="yellow">Don't get distracted and study hard.</font>

599
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:21,584
<font color="yellow">I'm not a student. I'm an attor--
No.</font>

600
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:23,127
<font color="yellow">I'm an adult.</font>

601
00:54:23,127 --> 00:54:25,506
<font color="yellow">I work at a nice company.</font>

602
00:54:25,506 --> 00:54:28,430
<font color="yellow">And I'm not that young.</font>

603
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,933
<font color="yellow">Then find a pretty girlfriend.</font>

604
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:33,410
<font color="yellow">And go on a fun date.</font>

605
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:35,004
<font color="yellow">I'm leaving.</font>

606
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:57,169
<font color="yellow">You are crazy, Kim Sang Wook.</font>

607
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,576
<font color="yellow">I miss her already.</font>

608
00:55:00,576 --> 00:55:02,627
<font color="yellow">What must she do for a living?</font>

609
00:55:02,627 --> 00:55:06,417
<font color="yellow">She always leaves when the time is up.
Like Cinderella.</font>

610
00:55:06,417 --> 00:55:08,607
<font color="yellow">She is attractive.</font>

611
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:11,551
<font color="yellow">The beef tastes like a sausage.</font>

612
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:13,352
<font color="yellow">Sausage?</font>

613
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,989
<font color="yellow">- Didn't you eat sausage?
- Did I eat sausage?</font>

614
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:18,297
<font color="yellow">We are out of firewood.</font>

615
00:55:18,297 --> 00:55:20,366
<font color="yellow">Can someone go get some firewood?</font>

616
00:55:20,366 --> 00:55:23,241
<font color="yellow">- Okay, I will...
- I will...</font>

617
00:55:23,241 --> 00:55:25,076
<font color="yellow">You are a guest. You can stay here.</font>

618
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:27,955
<font color="yellow">I will go get some.</font>

619
00:55:27,955 --> 00:55:29,486
<font color="yellow">Okay. Eat some more, Dr. Hong.</font>

620
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,814
<font color="yellow">Where is the firewood...</font>

621
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:41,352
<font color="yellow">We have some here.</font>

622
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:47,306
<font color="yellow">It's very...</font>

623
00:55:47,306 --> 00:55:49,660
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Hae Sung.</font>

624
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:54,544
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

625
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:02,801
<font color="yellow">Does it hurt? Here?</font>

626
00:56:02,801 --> 00:56:08,125
<font color="yellow">Earlier today, I jumped off
from a high cliff.</font>

627
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,776
<font color="yellow">Because of some woman.</font>

628
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:19,649
<font color="yellow">- Relax.
- I am relaxing.</font>

629
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:21,763
<font color="yellow">This is my muscle.</font>

630
00:56:25,797 --> 00:56:28,364
<font color="yellow">We should take an x-ray to be sure.</font>

631
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:30,267
<font color="yellow">I think either you fractured
or broke your rib.</font>

632
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,306
<font color="yellow">- What?
- What?</font>

633
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:32,806
<font color="yellow">You must have been under a lot of pain.</font>

634
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:40,156
<font color="yellow">A man should be able
to endure some pain.</font>

635
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:48,750
<font color="yellow">- Hello?
- Ryu Hae Sung is there, right?</font>

636
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,645
<font color="yellow">What? Who are you?</font>

637
00:56:50,645 --> 00:56:52,323
<font color="yellow">Don't you know your Company Director's
phone number?</font>

638
00:56:52,323 --> 00:56:53,837
<font color="yellow">Put Hae Sung on the phone.</font>

639
00:56:57,268 --> 00:56:59,417
<font color="yellow">- She wants to talk to you.
- Who?</font>

640
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,484
<font color="yellow">- This is Ryu Hae Sung.
- Are you crazy?</font>

641
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:09,009
<font color="yellow">You turned your phone off.
What are you doing there?</font>

642
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:10,680
<font color="yellow"><i>20 billion won is on the line.</i></font>

643
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:17,866
<font color="yellow">Yes. Excuse me.</font>

644
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:19,390
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

645
00:57:25,564 --> 00:57:27,701
<font color="yellow">I never said I'd go there.</font>

646
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,591
<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense,
and come here now.</font>

647
00:57:29,591 --> 00:57:33,265
<font color="yellow">What? You don't want to drive?
Should I send you a helicopter?</font>

648
00:57:33,265 --> 00:57:35,002
<font color="yellow"><i>This project is worth 20 billion won.</i></font>

649
00:57:35,002 --> 00:57:37,093
<font color="yellow">If we fail to merge with China Media,
are you going to be responsible for it?</font>

650
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:39,109
<font color="yellow">Why is that because of me?</font>

651
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:42,306
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to go to President Wang's
Daughter's birthday party?</font>

652
00:57:42,306 --> 00:57:44,073
<font color="yellow">Am I her boyfriend or a fiancee?</font>

653
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:48,678
<font color="yellow">We could go that way. It's better than
causing a scandal with Lee So Hye.</font>

654
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:53,055
<font color="yellow">Come here now. If you don't,
I'm not going to leave Lee So Hye alone.</font>

655
00:57:53,055 --> 00:57:55,576
<font color="yellow">You know how I do things.</font>

656
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:57,538
<font color="yellow">It will be better for you
to come here now.</font>

657
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:12,680
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you will be okay?</font>

658
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,993
<font color="yellow">I'm a man. This is nothing.</font>

659
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,064
<font color="yellow">Are you going to China?</font>

660
00:58:19,064 --> 00:58:22,672
<font color="yellow">They desperately want me there.</font>

661
00:58:22,672 --> 00:58:25,596
<font color="yellow">They said they sent me a flight.
I should get going.</font>

662
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,027
<font color="yellow">Focus on writing your script.</font>

663
00:58:30,027 --> 00:58:32,781
<font color="yellow">Don't go watch stars.</font>

664
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:34,542
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

665
00:59:12,201 --> 00:59:16,471
<font color="yellow">Our society is very conservative.</font>

666
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:18,799
<font color="yellow">If this leaks out to the media,
you can't be an actor.</font>

667
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:20,422
<font color="yellow">That will be the end of everything.</font>

668
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:22,779
<font color="yellow">You don't necessarily have to
work with me.</font>

669
00:59:22,779 --> 00:59:26,364
<font color="yellow">But I found this. Do you think other
companies can't find this?</font>

670
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,727
<font color="yellow">I think you will need
someone to shield you.</font>

671
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:30,573
<font color="yellow">I'm really good at those things.</font>

672
00:59:35,236 --> 00:59:38,649
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ryu Hae Sung is a funny person.</font>

673
00:59:38,649 --> 00:59:40,040
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

674
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:44,033
<font color="yellow">It seems like you have
known him for a while.</font>

675
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:46,803
<font color="yellow">Hm... Yes.</font>

676
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:51,663
<font color="yellow">- But, will it be okay?
- What?</font>

677
00:59:51,663 --> 00:59:55,323
<font color="yellow">He's hurt. I'm not sure
if he is okay to drive.</font>

678
00:59:58,788 --> 01:00:01,323
<font color="yellow">He should be okay.</font>

679
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:05,960
<font color="yellow">How did he get hurt?</font>

680
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,995
<font color="yellow">There was an accident
at the filming site.</font>

681
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:15,509
<font color="yellow">I could have died from
falling off a cliff. Not from cancer.</font>

682
01:00:15,509 --> 01:00:17,317
<font color="yellow">It could have been very serious.</font>

683
01:00:19,357 --> 01:00:21,977
<font color="yellow">Then by any chance...</font>

684
01:00:21,977 --> 01:00:25,198
<font color="yellow">Is Mr. Ryu Hae Sung your Number One Man?</font>

685
01:00:25,198 --> 01:00:26,680
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

686
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:29,725
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

687
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:35,027
<font color="yellow">Please forget about
what happened yesterday.</font>

688
01:00:35,027 --> 01:00:38,138
<font color="yellow">Yesterday?
Did something happen yesterday?</font>

689
01:00:38,138 --> 01:00:40,817
<font color="yellow">Oh, this...</font>

690
01:00:46,205 --> 01:00:48,790
<font color="yellow">Did you not have trouble breathing today?</font>

691
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:51,665
<font color="yellow">Yeah...</font>

692
01:00:51,665 --> 01:00:54,640
<font color="yellow">By the way.</font>

693
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,518
<font color="yellow">I will go ahead with the clinical
treatment. I will receive treatment.</font>

694
01:00:57,518 --> 01:01:00,020
<font color="yellow">I want to give it a try.</font>

695
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,312
<font color="yellow">That's a great idea.</font>

696
01:01:02,312 --> 01:01:05,895
<font color="yellow">But why did you change your mind?</font>

697
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,564
<font color="yellow">The moment that I fall on that airbag</font>

698
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,381
<font color="yellow">this came to my mind.</font>

699
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:17,705
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that I'm alive.</font>

700
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:23,506
<font color="yellow">If I can...</font>

701
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:25,614
<font color="yellow">I want to live a bit longer.</font>

702
01:01:30,252 --> 01:01:32,466
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

703
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,832
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure why it is hurting to say
that I want to live longer.</font>

704
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:40,730
<font color="yellow">I'm scared.</font>

705
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,598
<font color="yellow">I'm scared that I might become greedy.</font>

706
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:47,399
<font color="yellow">I want to live longer.</font>

707
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:50,763
<font color="yellow">I want to be in love.</font>

708
01:01:50,763 --> 01:01:53,939
<font color="yellow">I might find myself asking for more
things. I might look disgusting.</font>

709
01:01:58,149 --> 01:02:00,330
<font color="yellow">You are being truthful to your feelings.</font>

710
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,924
<font color="yellow">Why do you think you might
look disgusting?</font>

711
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:09,051
<font color="yellow">I think nothing is more important than
finding my own happiness.</font>

712
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:19,694
<font color="yellow">What you said earlier...</font>

713
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,180
<font color="yellow">Does that still hold true?</font>

714
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:26,448
<font color="yellow">You wanted to start a relationship.</font>

715
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:31,942
<font color="yellow">I want to be your Number One Man.</font>

716
01:02:31,942 --> 01:02:33,698
<font color="yellow">It's okay even if you have a cancer.</font>

717
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,252
<font color="yellow">Let's go on a date.</font>
