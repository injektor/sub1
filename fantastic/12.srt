<i>[EPISODE 12]</i>
Let's get married.

3
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,950
I really wanted to say this.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,120
I haven't gotten the ring back yet.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
But let's get married.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,690
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,230
I don't want to get married.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,990
Why?

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:45,750
We are as happy as we can be now.

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,890
Why do we need to get married?

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,490
That's not it.

12
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,020
It's not like we are the only ones
needed for the wedding.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,220
My sisters and brothers
don't even know that I'm sick.

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,650
Can you tell your grandmother
that I'm sick?

15
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:06,690
See? It's giving you a headache already.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,540
Let's just stay like this.
I'm happy as I can possibly be.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,900
It's that hump that we have to
get over anyway.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,930
We still have to try,
even if it is tough.

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,070
I want to be Lee So Hye's
legal guardian.

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,290
If we submit a marriage certificate,
reporters will find out.

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,420
And If I leave, you...

22
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,260
Don't make me a shameless person.
I can never do that.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,090
Why can't you do that?

24
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:39,080
Marriage is the "event"
that all the couples wait for.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,200
- Why would you avoid that happy event?
- I don't want to do it.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,700
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,980
I'm tired. I want to be alone.

28
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,810
Okay.

29
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,440
Okay then.

30
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,570
Ryu Hae Sung.

31
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,440
- Oh my.
- Why are you so surprised?

32
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,300
You told me to leave, and
you came here all of a sudden...

33
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,870
Are you upset?

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,340
What do you mean upset?
A man should never get upset.

35
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,770
You are upset.

36
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,240
I said no.

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,960
I know you are upset.

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,090
Yes, I'm upset.

39
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,810
How many times do I have
to get dumped by my Lee So Hye?

40
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,570
I'm getting dumped even when
we are living together.

41
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,160
I'm the Universal Top Star.

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,910
My pride is hurt.

43
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,300
Instead, I will grant your wish.

44
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,660
A wish?

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,060
I said I will grant your wish
if you quit smoking.

46
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,620
- Are you really going to grant my wish?
- Yes.

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,680
What is your wish?

48
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,210
- Can it really be anything?
- Yes. That was my promise.

49
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,770
Gosh.

50
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,430
So I mean...

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,650
We were supposed to get married
and go on a honeymoon and...

52
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:39,390
in a suite that has a great ocean view...
A panoramic view...

53
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,910
I wanted to spend
our first night together.

54
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,520
But since you are so against it...

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,550
The suite and the view
don't really matter.

56
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,080
We can just imagine
that we are in a suite.

57
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,630
As long as we feel comfortable...

58
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,400
Gosh.

59
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,550
Lee So Hye, you can't do this.

60
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,690
Are you embarrassed? Is that why
you're pretending like you're asleep?

61
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,470
So Hye.

62
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,140
Lee So Hye. Lee So Hye.

63
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,840
<i>- How could you put foil in there?
- You told me to put it in there.</i>

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,980
I told you to put it in the oven.
That's a microwave.

65
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,780
- You should have told me clearly.
- Gosh.

66
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,280
- Fire!
- Get that frying pan.

67
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,650
What are you doing?

68
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,510
Oh.

69
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,370
- Are you awake?
- Good morning, Writer Lee.

70
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,450
I was going to make you
clay-roasted duck.

71
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,450
- But Chang Seok burned it all.
- I did?

72
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,880
- Oh my.
- Who would put that in the microwave?

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,960
Throw that away.

74
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,270
- You.
- Leave.

75
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,450
You can't even cook this?

76
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,910
Geez.

77
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,240
I fell asleep all of a sudden
yesterday, right?

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,350
Yes. That's not fair.

79
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,310
For that, grant one more wish.

80
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,180
Gosh, that's nonsense.

81
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,370
What do you mean that's nonsense?

82
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,860
I was talking about something very
important. How could you fall asleep?

83
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,390
- Writer Lee, your friend is here.
- Seol.

84
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:39,690
- You are awake. Hello.
- Welcome. Your hair...

85
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,880
I guess you are making breakfast.
I was going to make you breakfast.

86
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,000
You have perfect timing.

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
How is your mother?

88
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,990
She got a lot better. Thank you so much.

89
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,860
You found a good nursing home,
and paid everything one year in advance.

90
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,800
My grandmother is there.

91
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,130
I thought it would be nice for them
to spend time together.

92
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,100
But I owe you too much.

93
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm not giving it to you for free.

94
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,660
You should pay me back.
Find a job first.

95
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,160
Some will be taken out automatically
from your paycheck every month.

96
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,750
- Stop it.
- Why?

97
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,400
You should be accurate and clear
when it comes to money.

98
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,330
Of course. I will make sure
I pay you back.

99
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,440
So I found a good job for you.

100
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
It will also give you a place to stay.

101
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,620
And you will get a chef's paycheck.

102
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,270
How could you find such a job?

103
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,220
I don't even have a cooking license.

104
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,050
Here.

105
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,390
What about our house?
We are desperately looking for a cook.

106
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,990
- What?
- Yes.

107
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,730
Hae Sung and Chang Seok
renovated the guest room.

108
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,020
If you can stay here and
cook for us once in a while

109
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,460
that would be great.

110
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,870
Our So Hye is good at writing.

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,380
Cooking isn't...

112
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,510
Okay. I will do my best.

113
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,910
- Chang Seok, we should go.
- Where?

114
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,640
- Have a good time.
- Bye.

115
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,480
Go. Hurry. We don't have time.

116
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,160
Why did you buy so much?

117
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm going to cook something delicious.

118
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,290
Why, why, why?

119
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,030
Come here. What are you doing?

120
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,820
Come to your senses.
She is still married.

121
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,100
She will be single soon.

122
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,180
You are going to support me, right?

123
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,910
Okay, I will support you. Go, go.

124
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,990
Stop it. Go.

125
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,900
Hey, this is not right.

126
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,620
What do you want to eat?
What should I make? Just tell me.

127
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm Chef Baek.

128
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,650
Hm... Then...

129
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,350
That tteokbokki we used to eat
after school.

130
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,410
Tteokbokki? That's all?

131
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,080
I'm good at making Korean Court Cuisine.

132
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,400
- Oh, then... Japchae.
- You are a japchae killer.

133
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,260
Okay. Just wait.

134
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,050
- Please make something delicious.
- Okay.

135
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,080
What about your husband?
What did your mother-in-law say?

136
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,170
They are scared about that ledger.

137
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,460
They are begging me.

138
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,610
Don't worry about the ledger.
We put in in Hae Sung's safe.

139
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,990
I'm going to prepare the divorce papers
for when I see him.

140
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,920
I have to fight against
the owner of a law firm.

141
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,500
That's right.

142
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,240
Let's find a good lawyer.

143
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,070
Jin Tae knows everyone.
I'm not sure if that will be possible.

144
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,300
Hae Sung left his script here.

145
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,530
- I'll go and give it too him.
- Okay. Be back soon.

146
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,380
Hello.

147
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,720
We have many different designs.
Would you come inside and take a look?

148
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,360
- You look so pretty.
- You look very pretty.

149
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,940
- This is the one for you.
- You look nice.

150
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,770
- Have you decided?
- Should we try other ones?

151
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,470
- There are a lot of pretty dresses.
- They have a lot.

152
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,370
This looks good on you too.
You look so pretty.

153
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,470
- Seol.
- So Hye, where are you?

154
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,090
It has been a long time.

155
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,840
It's so nice to talk to you again.
How have you been?

156
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,990
What? What is wrong with you?

157
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,830
Don't you remember me?

158
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,850
Hey, it's me. Lee So Hye.

159
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,700
Of course I remember you.

160
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,100
What's wrong? Are you joking?

161
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,200
What do you mean joking?

162
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,830
We haven't seen each other for too long.

163
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,790
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

164
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,430
I even dreamed about riding
a motorcycle with you.

165
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,150
So Hye, where are you?

166
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,210
Here? Don't be surprised.

167
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:00,290
I'm getting married.

168
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,750
Yes, this is Hong Joon Ki.

169
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,470
Oh, yes. Ms. Baek Seol.

170
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,590
<i>Dr. Hong. So Hye is acting strangely.</i>

171
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,180
What do you mean strange?

172
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,420
Let's eat lunch.

173
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,690
Director Yoon, what should we
eat for lunch?

174
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,520
Let's order box lunch.

175
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Director Yoon, we are getting
sick of box lunch.

176
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,810
We could take you to a Chinese
restaurant. How about that?

177
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:43,830
That's fine by me. What should I eat?

178
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,810
- Stir-fried seafood and vegetables?
- Stir-fried sea cucumber?

179
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,390
- Sweet and sour pork?
- Fried pork belly in soy sauce?

180
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,870
You lost.

181
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,320
Stir-fried meatballs and vegetables.

182
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,890
Yes, Seol. What's up?

183
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,820
Cheongdam-dong? Okay.

184
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,490
Let's have lunch together later.

185
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,580
- Director Yoon.
- What?

186
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,630
Let's order box lunch.

187
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,480
- Black bean noodles.
- Set A.

188
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,810
- Follow me.
- Let's go.

189
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,470
Be careful. The bride is here.

190
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,840
- Wow, you look beautiful.
- You look great.

191
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,720
- You have a very nice figure.
- Really?

192
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,920
It look great on you.

193
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,580
It's very nice.

194
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,630
Seol.

195
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,170
What do you think?

196
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,930
- You look so pretty.
- Right?

197
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,080
Should I try other ones?
Pick one for me.

198
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,210
What kind of dress did you wear?

199
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,100
I didn't even get to
see you wearing a wedding dress.

200
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,130
You didn't invite us to your wedding.

201
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,440
How could you do that?

202
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,810
You didn't keep in touch with us
after getting married.

203
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,720
Do you know how disappointed I was?

204
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,180
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,960
Why do I even need a friend?

206
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,770
Mi Sun and you.
You guys are all the same.

207
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,870
I couldn't call you
after getting married.

208
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,120
Mi Sun didn't answer my call.
She's always busy taking care of her kid.

209
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,560
Do you know how tough it was for me?

210
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,450
I got betrayed by Hae Sung,
and my miniseries failed.

211
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,190
I had no money, so I had to live
in that tiny room.

212
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,630
Do you know how lonely I was?

213
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,840
I'm sorry, So Hye.

214
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,720
There was nothing I could do.

215
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,000
It must have been very tough for you.

216
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,910
I'm sorry, So Hye.

217
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:13,380
I should have called you earlier.

218
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,600
Can't you call Mi Sun?

219
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,280
I called her just now.
She said she will be here soon.

220
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,210
Really?

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,890
Oh my.

222
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,360
Mr. Ryu Hae Sung, what brings you here?

223
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,520
- So Hye.
- Don't come here.

224
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,670
You should be doing the script reading.
Why did you come here?

225
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,040
If you have time to come here,
go memorize your lines.

226
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,700
Do you want people to keep calling you
"Acting Impotent?"

227
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,070
Do you not have pride?

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,990
Please leave. I have nothing more to say.

229
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,460
Gosh. That Universal fool.

230
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,930
I suffered so much because of him.

231
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,190
How could he come here
as if nothing happened?

232
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,820
What? "So Hye?"

233
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:31,000
Seol, that's pretty too, right?

234
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,910
This is pretty too.

235
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,700
It looks prettier up close.

236
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,160
Don't worry too much.

237
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,220
It's not like she has dementia or
something wrong with her brain.

238
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,250
She is having delirium because
of that medication.

239
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,960
Delirium?

240
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,970
It's a momentary confusion.

241
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,120
It's the side effect of that medication.

242
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,730
- It's common.
- What did she take?

243
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,350
Pain killers contains drug components.

244
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,640
So those components together
caused a problem.

245
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,080
You should talk to her
and take her home.

246
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,720
Don't be too worried.

247
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,790
Relax. Okay?

248
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:46,790
You are here. How do I look?

249
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,980
How about these?

250

251
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,320
It's not the end of world.
She's not that serious.

252
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,240
Please cheer up.

253
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,450
It's just like when my mom was
first diagnosed with dementia.

254
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,300
It's not that, right?

255
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,060
This is different from dementia.

256
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,470
Delirium is a momentary symptom.

257
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,340
Once she calms down...
It won't last long.

258
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,310
So she doesn't have to
go to the hospital?

259
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:04,960
She will recover faster if she stays

260
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,700
at a familiar place with
her close friends.

261
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,250
Once she comes back to senses and
remembers what she has been doing...

262
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,100
It will confuse her.
It is more serious with the people

263
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,580
who have strong pride
in themselves. Like Writer Lee.

264
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,450
When that happens,
please be calm and console her.

265
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,700
And don't let her skip meals.

266
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,040
She has to eat well to fight off
the side effects.

267
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,170
I will make the foods she likes.

268
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,700
You should go back. I know you are busy.

269
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,850
We will take care of So Hye.

270
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,250
I will stay here until the meeting.

271
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,990
Don't worry. You can go.

272
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,650
Okay.

273
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,990
Welcome.

274
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,780
I came to say goodbye.

275
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,960
I'm leaving Adonis Entertainment today.

276
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,650
I have a goodbye gift for you.

277
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,900
I told you this already. Once the main
character dies, the drama ends.

278
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,110
If you leak this to the media
and make Hitman fail

279
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,130
you will lose a lot too.

280
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,970
Will you be okay?

281
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,590
Our Hae Sung knows so much now.

282
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,630
Yes, I don't want to take a loss.

283
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:43,700
But Hitman is making me lose
more as we move along.

284
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,380
So I'm just going to end it.

285
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,950
We had a press preview session on
that drama we filmed with newbies.

286
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,500
They were very positive about it.

287
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,960
I'm going to end Hitman
and air that drama instead.

288
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,930
What do you think? I can kill the main
character, but I will still survive.

289
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,410
Don't you think it's a good idea?

290
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,400
Why are you going this far?

291
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,750
I spent all that money and time

292
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,460
to raise an “acting impotent" actor.
But now he is trying to betray me.

293
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,640
On top of that,
do you want me to take losses?

294
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,750
Do you think you could just let this go
if you were me?

295
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,770
Okay. Let's do this then.

296
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,770
I will be responsible for Hitman.

297
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,860
How much will it cost to bombard me?

298
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,990
You will be responsible for Hitman?

299
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,320
You mean you want to let
Lee So Hye keep her last drama?

300
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,700
Wow, this is an amazing love.
It's a tearjerker.

301
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,530
I didn't know
you could be this romantic.

302
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,900
Please do me a favor.

303
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,520
Let me be in charge of Hitman.
Let's settle this.

304
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,660
Will it be okay

305
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,040
even if you have to give me
everything you have?

306
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,540
Yes.

307
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,860
Please make a contract.

308
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,680
I will make one too.

309
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,420
Hey, Ryu Hae Sung.
Consider this carefully.

310
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,980
If this goes wrong,
you will lose everything.

311
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,270
- What are you going to do then?
- What do you mean?

312
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,980
- I will spend less.
- Nothing will be left.

313
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,770
Do you think CEO Choi is going to
let you have Hitman that easily?

314
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,120
She will literally take
everything you have.

315
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,280
So we should do our best to
make Hitman a well-made drama.

316
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,370
I'm going to invest everything,
and make it the best drama ever.

317
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,930
Caring for a patient
is not as easy as it sounds.

318
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,920
On top of that,
you are trying to produce Hitman.

319
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,990
- Can you handle everything?
- I have to do this.

320
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,730
If Hitman fails...

321
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,130
So Hye will be having a very tough time.

322
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,340
That's true.

323
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,680
Have you found an attorney? I think
I should see him before I go filming.

324
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,810
I did. But everyone is related to
CEO Choi's brother's law firm.

325
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,060
This is not good.

326
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,080
There's no attorney?

327
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,730
Didn't Writer Sang Hwa say
she used to go to law school?

328
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,030
That's right. She did say that.

329
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,610
Hey.

330
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,330
- Get up.
- Oh my.

331
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,670
- I said get up. Your client is here.
- Why?

332
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,810
Universal Top Star, Ryu Hae Sung.

333
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,230
Gosh. Why would Ryu Hae Sung come here?

334
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,750
You can come in.

335
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,240
Get up.
Your favorite Ryu Hae Sung is here.

336
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,940
What?

337
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,300
Ryu Hae Sung is really here.

338
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,870
Yes, hello.

339
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,810
Are you really an attorney?

340
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,510
He looks way too young.

341
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,450
He passed the bar exam
with the highest score

342
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,010
and won first place
in the training group.

343
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,560
He is like a walking law encyclopedia.

344
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,320
But he is jobless at the moment,
so he has a lot of free time.

345
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,140
Wow.

346
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,630
- I admire you a lot.
- Me?

347
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,850
I volunteer in the same group you do.

348
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,750
Oh.

349
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,150
With the money that you donate
every year

350
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,600
a lot of people are getting
the help that they need.

351
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,100
I'm Kim Sang Wook.

352
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,600
Sang Wook? Your name sounds familiar.

353
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,350
- Sang Wook. Kim Sang Wook.
- That's great.

354
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,640
It would have been better if
he was Joo Sang Wook.

355
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,320
Anyway. It's great.

356
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,340
By the way. How can I help you?

357
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,060
It is a secret.

358
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,970
Can I trust you?

359
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,080
Of course. I protect my client's
secrets as if they were my own.

360
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,670
When I was adopted and stayed
in the U.S...

361
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:27,960
At the age of 17, I made a huge mistake.

362
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,230
I'm still getting threatened
because of that incident.

363
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,310
Are they threatening that they will
leak this to the media?

364
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,050
Yes.

365
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,520
If that happens...

366
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,430
I want to know if there's anything
I can do about that.

367
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,610
And I want to know if there's a way
I can stop them beforehand.

368
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,230
We should find a way.

369
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,290
Well.

370
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:57,230
Can you tell me
what kind of mistake you made?

371
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,030
When did you make that?

372
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,630
I made it just now.

373
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,170
Let's eat. I made your favorites,
tteokbokki and japchae.

374
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:17,090
Try it. It's amazing.

375
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,730
It looks good.

376
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,590
What about Hae Sung?

377
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,360
What time is it now?

378
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,270
Hae Sung is filming now.
It's three o'clock.

379
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,320
Three o'clock in the afternoon?

380
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,240
It's afternoon?

381
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,270
Seol.

382
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,330
You came here this morning, right?

383
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,170
Yes, that's right.

384
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,880
Then...

385
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,390
I wandered around like a crazy person.

386
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,040
So that was real?

387
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,130
It was not a dream, right?

388
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,070
No.

389
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,410
It's a side effect. It's delirium.

390
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,150
You will get better.

391
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:18,260
Did I really go to that wedding shop?

392
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,270
And Hae Sung saw that.

393
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,160
This is awful.

394
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,980
This is so embarrassing.

395
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,740
It's okay. You looked just fine.

396
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,830
No.

397
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,950
I really want to die.

398
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,660
I feel sorry to see you guys.

399
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,010
I'm embarrassed.

400
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,800
Hey, do you want to see
who should be more embarrassed?

401
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,120
I worked like a slave for 10 years.

402
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,410
And I cried in front of you guys.
I told you guys I can't do this anymore.

403
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,980
I should be embarrassed.
I'm number one.

404
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,920
Gosh, what are you talking about?

405
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,590
I got into trouble
as a senior in high school.

406
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,260
I've been number one since then.

407
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,280
I'm the champion in that department.

408
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,940
Let's fight.

409
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:13,210
What if I really lose my mind
and cause you guys trouble?

410
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,320
Don't worry. We are not going
to let you lose your mind.

411
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,230
You know I'm your bodyguard.

412
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,980
That's right. Don't worry about
losing your mind or acting strangely.

413
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,870
We are here for you.

415
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,280
Don't cry. It's tiring.

416
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,170
You have to eat well
if you want get get better.

417
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,580
Cheer up. Eat it.

418
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,550
That's right. Let's eat together.
Eat some japchae.

419
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,890
Seol is very good at cooking.

420
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,470
Hae Sung.

421
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:59,450
So Hye just woke up. She's okay.

422
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,900
Okay.

423
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,480
Hae Sung is almost here.

424
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,180
What?

425
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,900
Gosh. Tell him I'm sleeping.

426
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:18,840
Thanks for everything.
Where is So Hye? You said she woke up.

427
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,760
She must have been very tired.
She went back to bed.

428
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,630
She fell asleep again?

429
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,820
Why don't you just let her sleep?

430
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,680
I just want to see her face.

431
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,220
I bought a delicious cake.

432
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,230
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

433
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,840
Enjoy.

434
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,240
Princess So Hye, are you sleeping?

435
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,910
Are you okay now?

436
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,740
You looked so pretty
in that wedding dress.

437
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,420
Don't worry about it.
It was because of that medication.

438
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,000
I'm thankful that you came back
without getting hurt.

439
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,560
Stop it. I'm overwhelmingly embarrassed.

440
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,630
Don't be like that. Let me see your face.

441
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,550
I'm embarrassed too.

442
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,680
I didn't know you are having such a hard
time. And I asked you to marry me.

443
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,730
I deeply regret saying that.

444
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,310
Once you get all better

445
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,390
I will do a fancy proposal again.

446
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,510
If you reject me then,
I will really be upset.

447
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,710
Then forget everything
you saw this morning.

448
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,900
Why would I forget that?
You looked beautiful.

449
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,440
I should have taken a picture.

450
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,990
Oh my.

451
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,100
Let me see your face.
Don't cover your face.

452
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,000
Gosh, you are mean.

453
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,560
Honey.

454
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,530
It's my fault.

455
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,690
I was drunk,
and I think I lost my mind that day.

456
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,790
How could a son-in-law sing
a celebratory song when

457
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,950
my mother-in-law is in critical
condition? I was out of my mind.

458
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,550
Honey, please call me back.

459
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,020
What about your mother-in-law?

460
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,210
Did you find out where she is?

461
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,040
She had a surgery and got discharged.

462
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,150
She had a surgery?

463
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:01,390
- With what money?
- How would I know that?

464
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:04,240
I can't find where she went
after the surgery.

465
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,590
Then where is she?
She doesn't even have relatives.

466
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,730
Did you find her?

467
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:14,490
You can't get a hold of her yet?

468
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,730
I told you to lie down.
Why did you come here?

469
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,020
How can I stay in bed now?

470
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,230
At an important time like this...
That bitch.

471
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,530
She took our secret file.

472
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,670
That bitch.

473
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,680
We still took her in
even though she couldn't have a child.

474
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,910
How can she repay
our generosity like this?

475
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,550
She wouldn't have submitted it to
the prosecutor's office, right?

476
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:39,910
Do you think she has the guts
to do that?

477
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,370
She only cares about her mom.

478
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,440
She would need money for the surgery.
She took it to get some money from us.

479
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,030
I told you to just give her the money
for the surgery.

480
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:53,060
Why are we going through this trouble
because of that 30 million won.

481
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,360
This is making me anxious.

482
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,540
Whether it's a drawing or pottery,
let's sell what we can sell.

483
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,790
And find a place to keep the rest.

484
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,600
I'm too anxious.
I can't even sit straight.

485
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,330
It's her.

486
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,350
Honey.

487
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,110
You heard all of my
voice messages, right?

488
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,410
Now you know I'm deeply regretful
about the things I have done.

489
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,520
You sign it and take care of it.

490
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,430
[A DIVORCE BY CONSENT FORM]

491
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,530
- Honey.
- Stop acting funny.

492
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,320
- I'm not going to be fooled by you.
- I'm sorry. I will never do that again.

493
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,010
I will be nice to my mother-in-law.
Let's move out.

494
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,260
Then you will be free.

495
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't trust you at all.
Not even one percent.

496
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,330
Give me one more chance.

497
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,080
We spent all that time together.
We still have feelings for each other.

498
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,430
I'm trying to go up higher. Fly higher.
Are you trying to break my wings?

499
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,200
You know this is a very
important time for me.

500
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,960
That's your business.

501
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,470
Until now, I have been living
according to your plan and time.

502
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,650
From now on, I'm going to live
according to my plan and time.

503
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,400
This is a great time to start fresh.

504
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,040
So did you purposely leave our house?

505
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,110
Is that why you took that file?
What are you going to do with it?

506
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,740
That's my lifeline.

507
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,930
I can't give that back to you until we
get divorced and settle everything.

508
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:16,430
You didn't even pay taxes
on those illegal assets.

509
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,030
Why don't you donate them all?

510
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,860
Who's supporting you?
Who are you staying with?

511
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:25,330
I'm at my friend's house. My friends who
are 100 times better than you

512
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:30,470
gathered everything they have
to pay for my mom's surgery.

513
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,960
Submit this form and call me back
once you have the alimony ready.

514
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,510
Did you come alone?

515
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,540
What about her?

516
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,070
- What about the ledger?
- She wants to get divorced.

517
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,680
- What?
- Once she receives the alimony

518
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,730
she said she will give back that ledger.

519
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:06,610
She must be out of her mind.

520
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,680
It's strange.

521
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,120
- She has changed.
- So...

522
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,660
How did she get the money to do
the surgery and pay for the nursing home?

523
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,010
She said her friends lent it to her.

524
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,270
Friends? She doesn't have any friends.

525
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:25,330
Secretary Yang, come to my house.

526
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:28,000
Now! Right now!

527
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,330
She has been working all day.
She fell asleep.

528
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,710
Seol said she will settle some things
and go see her mom.

529
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,600
She will be back tomorrow.
I will get going.

530
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,430
Thank you, Mi Sun.
Say hello to Pil Ho for me.

531
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,500
So Hye.

532
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,510
So Hye, where are you going?

533
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,080
Stop it, Mr. Ryu Hae Sung.

534
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,290
I have no feelings left for you.

535
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,110
I have a boyfriend. Okay?

536
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,210
So Hye.

537
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,640
Gosh, Universal Fool.

538
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,190
He never gives me a break.

539
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,260
Writer Lee.

540
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,090
What did you just say?

541
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,300
I said "Universal Fool," why?

542
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,280
Why am I a Universal Fool?

543
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,460
You know that better than anyone.

544
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,890
Why do you keep following me?
Do you have nothing to do now?

545
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,430
I told you.

546
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:29,410
I'm going "all in" on you.

547
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,810
- You can go first.
- Let me give you a ride.

548
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,600
We are going in the same direction.

549
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,410
Same direction? Where are you going?

550
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,180
There. That place you are going.

551
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,710
The one behind that.

552
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,310
Let's go.

554
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,230
Huh?

555
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,890
What is wrong with this?

556
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,540
This is the right password.

557
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,730
Why don't I have the key card?

558
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,990
Did I get my password wrong?

559
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,810
Did I do it again?

560
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,140
I came all the way...
Did I lose my mind again?

561
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,490
You got better faster than before.

562
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,520
Writer Lee, let's go together.

563
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,740
Stop it. I don't want to joke around.

564
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,550
Hold on a second.

565
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,680
We came all the way here.
Let's go on a date.

566
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,560
I want to go home.

567
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,460
What if I do something strange again?

568
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,940
I'm right beside you. Why do you worry?

569
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,330
You don't know how I feel.

570
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:57,710
It's very scary and awful.

571
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,190
I know what that's like.

572
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm trying to be brave to tell you this.

573
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,080
I should have told you this earlier.

574
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,880
I can't delay it anymore.

575
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,470
What do you want to tell me?

576
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,120
It's more like a confession.

577
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,630
I have something to confess.

578
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,660
The reason I had to leave you hurt
for a long time.

579
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,390
The reason I had to
choose CEO Choi back then.

580
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:44,110
You know that I came
from America, right?

581
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,520
Yes.

582
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,100
I was adopted by a family in America
when I was young.

583
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,410
My mom was Korean.

584
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:57,340
Even though my father was strict,
they were nice people.

585
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,990
But in less than two years,
they had a baby.

586
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,030
It's obvious what happened after that.

587
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,020
I couldn't get their attention.

588
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,600
And so I caused some trouble
when I was a teenager.

589
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,810
Older kids in the neighborhood
said they would give me some money

590
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:19,120
so I got in the driver's seat.

591
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,200
There were drugs in that car.

592
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:31,180
Because of that, I was abandoned
and sent back to Korea.

593
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,650
And thanks to them,
I met Writer Lee So Hye.

594
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,510
And CEO Choi found out about that.

595
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:43,670
So she used that to her advantage
and dragged you around until now.

596
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,290
There's more to it than that.

597
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,120
CEO Choi found my grandmother.

598
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,910
She used to be my helper.

599
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:00,370
So I couldn't appear in your drama.

600
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,410
I had no choice.

601
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,210
She stills says she'll reveal everything
if I decline to re-sign with her.

602
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,480
And it will ruin your drama
that you worked so hard on.

603
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:17,210
You have been saying there's something
you wanted to tell me.

604
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,270
But I didn't even try to listen to you.

605
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,120
I'm mean.

606
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:27,360
No way. I would have done
the same thing if I was you.

607
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,540
I'm sorry.

608
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,630
How hard was it?

609
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:37,810
It must have been very tough for you.

610
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,310
My contract with CEO Choi expired today.

611
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,940
I'm going to work alone now.

612
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:46,280
That's nice. You will do great.

613
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,510
I will tell you once I come up
with a detailed plan.

614
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,490
It's scary for me too.

615
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,790
But I will do great.

616
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,730
So you have to fight too.

617
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:01,240
- Okay?
- Okay.

618
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,640
We have to cheer up.

619
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,990
Let's do this.

620
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,600
What are all these?

621
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,350
Come here and eat this.

622
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,120
I'm going to eat meat and cheer up.
I have to eat well to get better.

623
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,230
Wow, really?

624
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,220
- Are you feeling okay today?
- Yes.

625
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,360
I'm going to eat all of these.

626
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,810
I'm going to get better and
become Ryu Hae Sung's legal guardian.

627
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:43,970
- Huh?
- You will need a guardian too.

628
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,570
Am I wrong?

629
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,360
Well.

630
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,000
Let's get married.

631
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,430
Let's turn in
the marriage certificate later.

632
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,720
Let's just have a feast with friends

633
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,830
and have a small wedding.

634
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,430
Gosh.
Gosh.

635
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,400
Hold on.

636
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,650
Are you proposing to me
while you're eating meat?

637
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,170
Yes.

638
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,220
- Ah.
- I don't want it.

639
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,240
This is a lame proposal.

640
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,200
Oh, really?

641
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,290
Then.

642
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,870
What do you think? Is this good enough?

643
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:36,980
Let's get married.

644
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,240
I don't want it.
I'm going to dump you too.

645
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,160
Okay. Let's get married.
I will marry you.

646
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,150
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it delicious?

647
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,840
When Hae Sung said he wants to be
my legal guardian

648
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,790
I thought I was going to be
a burden on him.

649
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,330
That lame burden that causes him
all the trouble.

650
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,250
But...

651
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:16,380
I started to think the same thing
he thought of me.

652
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,510
Even though I'm sick and weak

653
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,260
I want to give him comfort.

654
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,770
Then I realized what made him say that.

655
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,270
I envy you guys.

656
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,060
I became braver after I had delirium.

657
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:41,370
After letting everyone see
my weak side, I feel free.

658
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,920
This is a secret.

659
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,680
I also had delirium after surgery.

660
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,010
You too?

661
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,160
Do you know what I did?

662
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,380
I acted like Batman. I ran around
the hospital in my underwear.

663
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,130
Batman!

664
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:03,020
- You're telling stories.
- It's true.

665
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,790
At first, I was so embarrassed.
I couldn't keep my head up.

666
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,890
But what's wrong with that?
People who are healthy make mistakes.

667
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:11,630
You are fighting against cancer.
You can make such mistakes.

668
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,580
But I do have regrets.

669
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,460
I should have found the person I don't
like and punched him in the face.

670
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:21,350
That's right.
I should have done that too.

671
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,740
It will come back, right? Whether
its delirium or something worse...

672
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,100
We have to go though them all, right?

673
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,980
Don't get discouraged like before.

674
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,690
Let's be positive and endure it all.

675
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,890
Eat well, and cheer up.

676
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

677
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,000
What brings you here?
You made a trip to Yeouido.

678
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,130
There's something I want to check.

679
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,700
By any chance...

680
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:02,840
That story with our Attorney Choi.
That's not true, right?

681
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,910
If it is true,
what difference would it make?

682
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:08,980
Oh, there will be some changes.

683
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,070
Attorney Choi won't be able
to run for election.

684
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,460
What I was trying to say was...

685
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:25,290
I was shocked by your mother's
and your attitude that day.

686
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:31,560
You took that crazy woman's word,
and you treated me like trash.

687
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,320
That's nonsense.

688
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,410
We were too shocked too.

689
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:37,790
I thought about that.

690
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:43,010
I thought your family is upright.
But it was disappointing.

691
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,980
Trust and loyalty are the lifelines
of the political field.

692
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,320
But you guys do not own those traits.

693
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,060
I still haven't made my decision.

694
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,460
Should I continue to
lead Attorney Choi his way?

695
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,110
Is that a wise thing to do?

696
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,940
You must be very disappointed in us.

697
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,150
Please forget about that.
We made a huge mistake.

698
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,690
Please forgive us.

699
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,580
Should we have a drink together then?

700
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,150
That sounds great.
I will buy you something delicious.

701
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:23,040
But I can't settle things
that easily these days.

702
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,660
That diamond wine.

703
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,000
I loved that.

704
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,590
We should drink that wine then.

705
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,540
Yes, yes, sir.
I will come visit you soon.

706
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,650
Please teach me a lot.

707
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,360
Yes.

708
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,670
Attorney Choi, here.

709
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:50,640
Attorney Kim Sang Wook asked me
to give this to you.

What?

719
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,630
How can he be so impolite?

720
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,150
- Jin Sook.
- You crazy jerk. Geez!

721
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,350
What is wrong with you?
There are people out there.

722
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,280
Don't ever work with Lee Mi Do again.

723
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,510
- You know what I mean, right?
- Why?

724
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:51,890
Did you meet her?

725
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,230
- What did she say?
- Do you know what kind of woman she is?

726
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,700
She will try to order you around.

727
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,500
Stop it before Mom passes out. Okay?

728
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,050
Okay.

729
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,670
Did you see that wench?
What did she say?

730
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,610
She doesn't listen to me.

731
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:15,270
I think she has a man.

732
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:17,890
- What?
- If that is true...

733
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:24,030
I'm not going to leave her alone.

734
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,160
I'm going to crush everything.

735
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,630
So Hye, where are you?

736
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,150
Oh, you are at the hospital.

737
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,430
I put your dinner in the fridge.
Don't forget to eat it.

738
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,980
Brother.

739
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:07,480
What brings you here?

740
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,600
I came to visit my friend.

741
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,880
Oh.

742
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,350
I came to see someone too.

743
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:25,000
How have you been?

744
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,760
I'm not working
at that law firm anymore.

745
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,100
Why? Is it because of me?

746
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,320
No.

747
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,790
It was not the place I thought it was.

748
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,850
I'm searching for another job.

749
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:45,100
You are going to be a great attorney.

750
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,100
Thank you for everything.

751
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,470
You won't know how comforting that was.

752
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:53,300
I really wanted to tell you this.

753
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,510
It's relief that I had
a chance to run into you.

754
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,700
Sister.

755
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,220
Huh?

756
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:00,410
I love you.

757
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:05,010
Move out from that house.
I will help you.

758
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:11,130
Sister.

759
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:16,290
Huh? Oh. What did you say?

760
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:20,340
I was zoning out. I couldn't hear you.

761
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:26,540
I said it's a relief to me too that I
have a chance to see you again.

762
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:30,970
You look a lot better than before.

763
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,030
Really?

764
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,630
Brother.

765
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:48,380
No, your hand. I will read your palm.

766
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,850
Oh, okay.

767
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,480
Your love line is very good.

768
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,530
You will meet someone nice soon.

769
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,090
Brother.

770
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,840
I wish you all the best.

771
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,760
I wish you all the best too.

772
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,010
Now we are rivals.

773
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,340
I'm just going to produce Hitman.

774
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:45,240
I'm not good at business.

775
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,770
- If you've read it, sign it.
- Hold on a second.

776
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:51,660
I want my attorney to be here.

777
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,730
Attorney?

778
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:04,560
Hello, I'm Hae Sung Entertainment
Corporation's Attorney, Kim Sang Wook.

779
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,460
This contract puts Mr. Ryu Hae Sung
at a disadvantage.

780
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,590
You should revise several conditions.

781
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,310
Which ones?

782
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:27,590
About Ryu Hae Sung's secret story.

783
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,140
Whatever the reason is,
if it gets leaked to the media

784
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,910
you should be responsible for it.

785
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,190
And you have to pay him three times
the contract fee if you violate it.

786
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:37,780
I want that
to be added to this contract.

787
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,380
Why would I pay that? It's not like
I'm the only one who knows it.

788
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,800
If you are not the only one who knows
about his secret

789
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,620
there is no reason for us
to sign this contact at all.

790
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,940
And there is too little information
about the budgets spent on Hitman.

791
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,010
You have to include supplemental
information in your budget.

792
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,870
That way, we can plan our budget too.

793
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:59,250
This is the contract that I made.
Please take a look at this.

794
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,800
Then I can't sign this contract.

795
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,450
Then we will sue you for using
his personal information

796
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,720
to threaten him
and try to wring money out of him.

797
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:30,840
You look so pretty.
This is the one for you.

798
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,090
- Really? Do I look okay?
- Yes.

799
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,660
Should I take a picture
and send it to Hae Sung?

800
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,810
No, don't do that. It's no fun
if he sees my dress now.

801
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:39,730
Okay. Let's surprise him.

802
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:42,020
I will do your makeup that day.

803
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,620
I will cook.

804
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,910
Our So Hye looks so pretty.

805
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:02,260
Oh. Why did you not go to bed?

806
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,920
Oh. I saw you at the cafe.

807
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,700
Who was that handsome guy?

808
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,820
Oh.

809
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,770
I was riding my motorcycle
and I just came to know him.

810
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,030
We are just like brother and sister.

811
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,580
Did he say he likes you?

812
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,980
It's all finished. I owe him so much.

813
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,140
It didn't seem like it's all done.

814
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,250
His eyes were full of love.

815
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,930
Do you think that makes sense?

816
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,610
I'm still married.

817
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,840
And I'm way older than him.

818
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:40,710
You should settle your problems first...

819
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:44,860
But there's nothing that can stop you.
You never know what will happen.

820
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:48,470
I'm being shameless.

821
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:52,210
I'm a divorcee. How could I start
a relationship with him?

822
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:53,880
Forget it.

823
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,320
He is a great person.

824
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,220
If you know someone,
introduce her to him.

825
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,190
Really?

826
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,310
Let's not do that.

827
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,540
It's great to live in a
house together, right?

828
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,300
Once my mom gets better

829
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,560
I will stay by your side
all day, every day.

830
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,940
Let's grow old together.

831
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:26,480
Okay. Until we become grandmothers,
let's stick tightly together.

832
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:44,020
So Hye is here.

833
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:47,670
Why do you want me to sneak out?
You can just come in.

834
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,190
Okay.

835
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,690
What kind of amazing present
do you have for me?

836
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,910
You asked Universal Top Star
to come here.

837
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,170
Joon Ki.

838
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:20,140
What is wrong with you?

839
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:22,050
My body doesn't listen to me well.

840
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,770
Backseat. I can't reach...

841
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:28,600
- Give me that bag.
- Bag?

842
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,470
Should I call 911?

843
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:36,660
No.

844
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,050
In the bag...

845
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,400
- Orange bottle.
- Orange.

846
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,050
Give me one pill.

847
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:11,070
Joon Ki.

848
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:13,940
Hong Joon Ki. Hong Joon Ki!
