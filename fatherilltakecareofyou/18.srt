1
00:00:06,953 --> 00:00:08,283
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

2
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,453
<font color="yellow">You can't date him.</font>

3
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:12,553
<font color="yellow">What? Why not?</font>

4
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:16,383
<font color="yellow">You can't date someone who's tall, pale,</font>

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,113
<font color="yellow">and have long limbs and fingers.</font>

6
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:21,883
<font color="yellow">When did you check his fingers?</font>

7
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:23,253
<font color="yellow">Cut it.</font>

8
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:24,553
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

9
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:28,613
<font color="yellow">You can't meet someone who is as handsome as him.</font>

10
00:00:29,253 --> 00:00:31,383
<font color="yellow">- It's dangerous. - Why?</font>

11
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:33,713
<font color="yellow">You had a passionate romance with Dad.</font>

12
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:35,553
<font color="yellow">I heard the entire town knew about it...</font>

13
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:37,983
<font color="yellow">and that your love story still remains as a town legend.</font>

14
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,553
<font color="yellow">I told you to cut it.</font>

15
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:41,613
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

16
00:00:42,883 --> 00:00:45,183
<font color="yellow">You know that the handsome face comes with a price, right?</font>

17
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,113
<font color="yellow">He's the perfect example.</font>

18
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,353
<font color="yellow">Also, I don't like his eyes.</font>

19
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:54,083
<font color="yellow">They look wicked and sorrowful.</font>

20
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:56,553
<font color="yellow">You can't meet a guy with a difficult past.</font>

21
00:00:56,813 --> 00:01:01,283
<font color="yellow">They tend to pounce on every little thing.</font>

22
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,453
<font color="yellow">And he doesn't own the house.</font>

23
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:05,783
<font color="yellow">His uncle does, right?</font>

24
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:08,083
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have his own place at his age...</font>

25
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,453
<font color="yellow">and lives in his uncle's house as if it were his.</font>

26
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:13,913
<font color="yellow">He seems like a playboy. I can't let you date him.</font>

27
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,783
<font color="yellow">I can never do that, okay?</font>

28
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:18,953
<font color="yellow">- He's not what you think. - What are you talking about?</font>

29
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,883
<font color="yellow">You've already lost your head over him.</font>

30
00:01:21,183 --> 00:01:23,113
<font color="yellow">You'd better pull yourself together.</font>

31
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:27,653
<font color="yellow">He flirts with you because you look like an easy fish to catch.</font>

32
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:28,783
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

33
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:30,513
<font color="yellow">You know how I ruined my life...</font>

34
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:32,883
<font color="yellow">after I got smitten by a guy with a sweet voice?</font>

35
00:01:34,183 --> 00:01:36,683
<font color="yellow">You can't date him.</font>

36
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:38,683
<font color="yellow">Understood?</font>

37
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,153
<font color="yellow">You got here 10 minutes earlier than usual.</font>

38
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:57,453
<font color="yellow">Why are you waiting outside? It's cold.</font>

39
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,813
<font color="yellow">- Get in the car. - Where are we going?</font>

40
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:37,353
<font color="yellow">You love sleeping outside.</font>

41
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:39,913
<font color="yellow">I will show you what sleeping out...</font>

42
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:43,753
<font color="yellow">- in the open is like. - Sorry?</font>

43
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:02,853
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

44
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,353
<font color="yellow">You really like sleeping out.</font>

45
00:03:08,253 --> 00:03:10,953
<font color="yellow">- I hope you enjoy it. - Gosh.</font>

46
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:13,483
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

47
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:19,113
<font color="yellow">Then, will we sleep inside the tent...</font>

48
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:22,213
<font color="yellow">together tonight?</font>

49
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:26,653
<font color="yellow">I'm just joking.</font>

50
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,113
<font color="yellow">You learned all the bad things from books.</font>

51
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,813
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Listen.</font>

52
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:40,113
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep in the camping car. And you like sleeping out,</font>

53
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,353
<font color="yellow">so you'll sleep in the tent. Okay?</font>

54
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,553
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - I'm joking.</font>

55
00:03:49,113 --> 00:03:50,553
<font color="yellow">You can sleep in the car.</font>

56
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,683
<font color="yellow">How can a lady be so clumsy?</font>

57
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,413
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

58
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:11,683
<font color="yellow">It's wonderful.</font>

59
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:14,183
<font color="yellow">This theater is just for two of us.</font>

60
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:18,383
<font color="yellow">It's better than a real theater, right?</font>

61
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:22,153
<font color="yellow">This is to make up for not being able to watch the movie before.</font>

62
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,583
<font color="yellow">Did you really have boyfriends in more than 150 countries?</font>

63
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,513
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Well,</font>

64
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:39,353
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that none of them took you out...</font>

65
00:04:39,553 --> 00:04:40,853
<font color="yellow">and showed movies like this.</font>

66
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:43,013
<font color="yellow">That's something you don't need to bother.</font>

67
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,613
<font color="yellow">Stop talking to me. I'm watching it.</font>

68
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:18,653
<font color="yellow">(Go back to where you were.)</font>

69
00:05:31,953 --> 00:05:33,213
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

70
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:35,683
<font color="yellow">I found someone who knows Sang Woo.</font>

71
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:40,553
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Are you not going to watch it?</font>

72
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,413
<font color="yellow">I'll be right there.</font>

73
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:53,853
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

74
00:05:54,453 --> 00:05:56,853
<font color="yellow">I think I found my brother. I should go now.</font>

75
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,083
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. Don't wait for me.</font>

76
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,083
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

77
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:06,153
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo. Hyun Woo!</font>

78
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:30,113
<font color="yellow">- I am Hyun Woo. - Hello.</font>

79
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:36,253
<font color="yellow">- I heard that you know Sang Woo. - That's right.</font>

80
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,753
<font color="yellow">So I...</font>

81
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:45,553
<font color="yellow">raised Sang Woo...</font>

82
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:49,053
<font color="yellow">who has lost his memory for 20 years.</font>

83
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:52,583
<font color="yellow">He was such a gentle and cute boy.</font>

84
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:55,913
<font color="yellow">I loved him a lot.</font>

85
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,553
<font color="yellow">So where is he now?</font>

86
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:04,013
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

87
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:07,313
<font color="yellow">He's in China.</font>

88
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,613
<font color="yellow">In China?</font>

89
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:12,053
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

90
00:07:13,353 --> 00:07:15,183
<font color="yellow">he had a car accident...</font>

91
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:17,753
<font color="yellow">and needs to get surgery.</font>

92
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,553
<font color="yellow">He called me that he needs money for that.</font>

93
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,683
<font color="yellow">He won't get the operation...</font>

94
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,013
<font color="yellow">if I don't send him money.</font>

95
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:42,053
<font color="yellow">I am sorry, Sir.</font>

96
00:07:44,153 --> 00:07:47,053
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. - There are so many con men.</font>

97
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,253
<font color="yellow">I'm like a drowning man who needs a straw to catch.</font>

98
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:55,383
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Jeong Eun?</font>

99
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:57,683
<font color="yellow">I thought you were enjoying camping with her.</font>

100
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:44,283
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, you're back.</font>

101
00:08:57,013 --> 00:08:58,153
<font color="yellow">Did you wait for me all night long?</font>

102
00:09:00,383 --> 00:09:01,953
<font color="yellow">I told you not to.</font>

103
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:05,153
<font color="yellow">But I felt like you'd come back.</font>

104
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,353
<font color="yellow">What about your brother? Did you find him?</font>

105
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,083
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

106
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,213
<font color="yellow">I made you breakfast,</font>

107
00:09:19,983 --> 00:09:22,483
<font color="yellow">wishing you had found your brother.</font>

108
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:46,453
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

109
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:52,083
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

110
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,753
<font color="yellow">You couldn't find him?</font>

111
00:10:42,253 --> 00:10:43,353
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

112
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,113
<font color="yellow">It's not the first time.</font>

113
00:10:57,753 --> 00:10:59,553
<font color="yellow">When I went there because they said they found my brother,</font>

114
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:01,553
<font color="yellow">it was someone else.</font>

115
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:03,953
<font color="yellow">Or it was a con man.</font>

116
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:07,683
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

117
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,253
<font color="yellow">This is how I spent my last 20 years.</font>

118
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,753
<font color="yellow">I could get tired of this.</font>

119
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,653
<font color="yellow">Whenever they say they know my brother,</font>

120
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:23,553
<font color="yellow">I end up rushing to the meeting like yesterday.</font>

121
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,153
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

122
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,213
<font color="yellow">I apologize for abandoning you like that last night.</font>

123
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:32,013
<font color="yellow">You didn't abandon me.</font>

124
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:34,483
<font color="yellow">I let you go to find your brother.</font>

125
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:37,953
<font color="yellow">You ought to find your brother.</font>

126
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:39,983
<font color="yellow">You've been waiting for him for a long time.</font>

127
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:43,113
<font color="yellow">Besides, even if he isn't your brother...</font>

128
00:11:43,113 --> 00:11:45,283
<font color="yellow">or he is a con man,</font>

129
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:48,683
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you go by all means if it's related to your brother?</font>

130
00:11:48,983 --> 00:11:50,653
<font color="yellow">That's what I think.</font>

131
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,183
<font color="yellow">I can't even remember my brother's face now.</font>

132
00:12:00,813 --> 00:12:02,453
<font color="yellow">A picture book he liked.</font>

133
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,813
<font color="yellow">Cucumber sandwich we ate together.</font>

134
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,113
<font color="yellow">These are the only things I remember about my brother.</font>

135
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,083
<font color="yellow">It's been 24 years.</font>

136
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:19,013
<font color="yellow">I might not be able to recognize him even if he's in front of me.</font>

137
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:23,013
<font color="yellow">Then, how old is he now?</font>

138
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,583
<font color="yellow">We were separated when he was seven years old.</font>

139
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:30,453
<font color="yellow">He must...</font>

140
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:32,413
<font color="yellow">be 31 years old now.</font>

141
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:37,883
<font color="yellow">Then, he's the same age with Seong Joon.</font>

142
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:46,453
<font color="yellow">Just like Seong Joon, he must be a healthy guy.</font>

143
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:50,953
<font color="yellow">Maybe.</font>

144
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:58,183
<font color="yellow">Even though 20 years have passed, I can understand...</font>

145
00:12:58,183 --> 00:13:00,053
<font color="yellow">why you want to find your brother.</font>

146
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:06,213
<font color="yellow">How can you?</font>

147
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,913
<font color="yellow">Didn't you happily grow up in a big family?</font>

148
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,853
<font color="yellow">That's not necessarily true.</font>

149
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:18,783
<font color="yellow">I also...</font>

150
00:13:21,013 --> 00:13:23,783
<font color="yellow">wander around to find my father.</font>

151
00:13:23,953 --> 00:13:25,753
<font color="yellow">I visited 150 countries in the world.</font>

152
00:13:31,183 --> 00:13:32,513
<font color="yellow">My mother...</font>

153
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,183
<font color="yellow">was a single mother.</font>

154
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,453
<font color="yellow">She was a single mother back then.</font>

155
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,153
<font color="yellow">She is quite amazing.</font>

156
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:43,983
<font color="yellow">Thanks to her, I grew up in secret.</font>

157
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:52,513
<font color="yellow">You said...</font>

158
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:55,883
<font color="yellow">your father's death was a wrongful death, right?</font>

159
00:13:56,813 --> 00:13:57,853
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

160
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:04,683
<font color="yellow">May I ask under what unfair circumstance he passed away?</font>

161
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:08,413
<font color="yellow">No, you may not.</font>

162
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:16,683
<font color="yellow">But we are dating.</font>

163
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:28,113
<font color="yellow">There are somethings that make your life difficult instead of...</font>

164
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,513
<font color="yellow">easier when you know more things.</font>

165
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:32,553
<font color="yellow">Don't try to find out.</font>

166
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,383
<font color="yellow">It won't be helpful to you, Jeong Eun.</font>

167
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:40,013
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

168
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,813
<font color="yellow">You don't want to suffer me, too. Right?</font>

169
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,683
<font color="yellow">However, after time passes by,</font>

170
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:55,483
<font color="yellow">tell me your suffering.</font>

171
00:14:56,653 --> 00:15:00,053
<font color="yellow">Tell me how your father passed away unjustly...</font>

172
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:03,053
<font color="yellow">and how you lost your brother.</font>

173
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,783
<font color="yellow">We are dating.</font>

174
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:29,113
<font color="yellow">(Director Bang Mi Joo)</font>

175
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:44,513
<font color="yellow">You are not going home?</font>

176
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:46,883
<font color="yellow">My grandmother wants me to stop by.</font>

177
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,483
<font color="yellow">If I don't, she calls me all day long.</font>

178
00:15:49,813 --> 00:15:52,683
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? Are you going to the construction site?</font>

179
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,983
<font color="yellow">I have to visit Home of Angels.</font>

180
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,213
<font color="yellow">Then, let's go together later.</font>

181
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:01,613
<font color="yellow">The tiles in the bathroom are all broken. The kids might get hurt.</font>

182
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:03,583
<font color="yellow">It's urgent. Let's go together next time.</font>

183
00:16:09,953 --> 00:16:12,113
<font color="yellow">Say hello to the director for me.</font>

184
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:14,683
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

185
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,953
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

186
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:25,053
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

187
00:16:25,913 --> 00:16:26,953
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

188
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:29,783
<font color="yellow">- We are meeting a lot. - Yes, we are.</font>

189
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:33,383
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, where are you coming from?</font>

190
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,653
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

191
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:39,253
<font color="yellow">I went camping.</font>

192
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:41,453
<font color="yellow">Camping?</font>

193
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:44,853
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

194
00:16:46,953 --> 00:16:49,283
<font color="yellow">But why are you home so early?</font>

195
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,313
<font color="yellow">Did something happen? You don't look so good.</font>

196
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,583
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

197
00:16:53,753 --> 00:16:55,283
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's go inside.</font>

198
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,683
<font color="yellow">Bye, Hyun Woo. Drive safely and call me.</font>

199
00:16:58,683 --> 00:16:59,683
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

200
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,453
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

201
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:22,283
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

202
00:17:22,813 --> 00:17:24,553
<font color="yellow">Do you know what you're doing?</font>

203
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:26,623
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

204
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,253
<font color="yellow">I'm here for a consultation about the pension...</font>

205
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:32,783
<font color="yellow">regarding my house.</font>

206
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,253
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please come this way.</font>

207
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,353
<font color="yellow">Okay. Hurry.</font>

208
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,123
<font color="yellow">A lot of families have disputes...</font>

209
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:43,313
<font color="yellow">due to inheritance and support issues.</font>

210
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,953
<font color="yellow">You can resolve these disputes through this pension.</font>

211
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,053
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

212
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,953
<font color="yellow">Children these days aren't shameful at all.</font>

213
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,083
<font color="yellow">They don't want to support their parents,</font>

214
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,583
<font color="yellow">but they fight over the inheritance.</font>

215
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:57,913
<font color="yellow">I don't know why they behave like that.</font>

216
00:17:58,913 --> 00:18:00,753
<font color="yellow">Why would you...</font>

217
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,813
<font color="yellow">tell him such things here?</font>

218
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:06,483
<font color="yellow">What? Am I wrong?</font>

219
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,623
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

220
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:13,953
<font color="yellow">You're glad you came, right?</font>

221
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,813
<font color="yellow">Since we found out about this,</font>

222
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:19,013
<font color="yellow">we should prepare for our golden years.</font>

223
00:18:19,883 --> 00:18:21,513
<font color="yellow">It's a good system.</font>

224
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:23,883
<font color="yellow">You're admitting that now?</font>

225
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,283
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

226
00:18:28,453 --> 00:18:29,583
<font color="yellow">He's so stubborn.</font>

227
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:34,853
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

228
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:37,953
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

229
00:18:38,813 --> 00:18:39,813
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

230
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:41,483
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

231
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,083
<font color="yellow">I was just resting. I'm tired. Why?</font>

232
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:47,813
<font color="yellow">Grandma asked me to help her.</font>

233
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:49,353
<font color="yellow">I was on my way to her...</font>

234
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:51,813
<font color="yellow">and I just wanted to talk to you.</font>

235
00:18:55,123 --> 00:18:57,053
<font color="yellow">Can you not...</font>

236
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:58,913
<font color="yellow">tell the family what...</font>

237
00:18:59,153 --> 00:19:02,053
<font color="yellow">you saw before?</font>

238
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:03,413
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

239
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:06,183
<font color="yellow">Are you really dating him?</font>

240
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:08,553
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

241
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:09,683
<font color="yellow">Do you...</font>

242
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,313
<font color="yellow">like him a lot?</font>

243
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:16,083
<font color="yellow">It's a bit embarrassing to say this to you, but I do.</font>

244
00:19:17,183 --> 00:19:21,053
<font color="yellow">We aren't serious though.</font>

245
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:23,453
<font color="yellow">If they find out,</font>

246
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,983
<font color="yellow">they will ask me if I will marry him or not.</font>

247
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,253
<font color="yellow">I want to keep it a secret for a while.</font>

248
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:31,013
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will keep your secret.</font>

249
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:35,653
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Seong Joon.</font>

250
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,453
<font color="yellow">Who's home?</font>

251
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,083
<font color="yellow">Uncle and Aunt. I'm here.</font>

252
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,983
<font color="yellow">I see. I heard you moved back to your house.</font>

253
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:50,013
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

254
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:52,813
<font color="yellow">Good job. You should sleep at your house.</font>

255
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:54,383
<font color="yellow">Your mother's disappointed if you don't.</font>

256
00:19:54,383 --> 00:19:55,553
<font color="yellow">Yes, I understand.</font>

257
00:19:57,213 --> 00:19:58,353
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

258
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,883
<font color="yellow">Why are you home so early?</font>

259
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:03,683
<font color="yellow">You don't come home this early.</font>

260
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:05,913
<font color="yellow">I was feeling a bit tired.</font>

261
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:11,653
<font color="yellow">Mother and Father. I will get some rest.</font>

262
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,483
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. How about dinner?</font>

263
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,153
<font color="yellow">I won't need it.</font>

264
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:18,913
<font color="yellow">I'll get some sleep, Mother.</font>

265
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,483
<font color="yellow">Is he sick?</font>

266
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:24,313
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

267
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,213
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, do you know anything about this?</font>

268
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:28,953
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

269
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,623
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

270
00:20:33,753 --> 00:20:35,453
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

271
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:36,653
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

272
00:20:38,053 --> 00:20:39,513
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

273
00:20:41,753 --> 00:20:44,683
<font color="yellow">My dear Dong Hui.</font>

274
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:48,483
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you, my Dong Hui.</font>

275
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,623
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

276
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,553
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

277
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,313
<font color="yellow">She's my Dong Hui. Why is she yours?</font>

278
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,353
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I raised her since she was six years old.</font>

279
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:00,953
<font color="yellow">So she's my baby.</font>

280
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,483
<font color="yellow">I'm so proud of you, Dong Hui.</font>

281
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:07,483
<font color="yellow">Congratulations, Aunt Dong Hui.</font>

282
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,283
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

283
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,383
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ji Hoon and Ah In.</font>

284
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,683
<font color="yellow">When I win the cash prize, I will treat you something good.</font>

285
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,783
<font color="yellow">- Yes! I'm excited. - Hey,</font>

286
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:20,513
<font color="yellow">- will you be getting a prize, too? - Of course.</font>

287
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:24,153
<font color="yellow">But because the contest is held by a cable television, it's not much.</font>

288
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:26,283
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

289
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:29,313
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui's level has just gone up.</font>

290
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,483
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

291
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,213
<font color="yellow">Then will you be debuting as a writer?</font>

292
00:21:36,013 --> 00:21:38,583
<font color="yellow">- I don't know yet. - Why don't you know it?</font>

293
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:42,483
<font color="yellow">Even if I win, it has to be turned into a TV show.</font>

294
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:45,483
<font color="yellow">And even if it gets turned into a TV show, I won't be recognized...</font>

295
00:21:45,623 --> 00:21:48,153
<font color="yellow">as a writer for just one short show.</font>

296
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:51,053
<font color="yellow">That's why you should use this as your opportunity...</font>

297
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:53,983
<font color="yellow">to write more shows for TV.</font>

298
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,683
<font color="yellow">It's easier said than done, you know?</font>

299
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:59,953
<font color="yellow">Anyway, good job.</font>

300
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:03,583
<font color="yellow">I'm proud of you.</font>

301
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:06,553
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you tell Seong Joon?</font>

302
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:09,113
<font color="yellow">He's helping you with many things.</font>

303
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:12,213
<font color="yellow">He should be the first one you should thank.</font>

304
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:16,213
<font color="yellow">Well... I haven't seen him yet.</font>

305
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:18,813
<font color="yellow">I think he came home early.</font>

306
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:22,283
<font color="yellow">I was actually going to go down.</font>

307
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:25,683
<font color="yellow">We should go down too, then.</font>

308
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:28,483
<font color="yellow">Let's leave Aunt Dong Hui alone so she can write again.</font>

309
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:33,483
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, keep writing. Write with all your might. Okay?</font>

310
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,653
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Kids. - Okay.</font>

311
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:38,113
<font color="yellow">Let's go down, Grandma.</font>

312
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,683
<font color="yellow">Okay. Let's go together.</font>

313
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,383
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Let's go.</font>

314
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,113
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

315
00:22:56,683 --> 00:22:58,013
<font color="yellow">I quit my job today.</font>

316
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:02,653
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll do great even if I'm not here.</font>

317
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:13,383
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - It's me.</font>

318
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:15,853
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director Bang.</font>

319
00:23:16,183 --> 00:23:17,883
<font color="yellow">Director Han is at home, right?</font>

320
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:21,213
<font color="yellow">I haven't seen him yet, but I think he is home.</font>

321
00:23:21,413 --> 00:23:24,513
<font color="yellow">I will go there now. I need to talk to you.</font>

322
00:23:50,883 --> 00:23:52,613
<font color="yellow">Hi, Dong Hui.</font>

323
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:55,113
<font color="yellow">Hi.</font>

324
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:04,583
<font color="yellow">Can you please change his mind?</font>

325
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:06,553
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

326
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:08,883
<font color="yellow">Don't you get it?</font>

327
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,913
<font color="yellow">Why did he resign in the first place?</font>

328
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:15,613
<font color="yellow">That's because...</font>

329
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:19,013
<font color="yellow">we had a trouble while preparing for our marriage.</font>

330
00:24:19,313 --> 00:24:20,683
<font color="yellow">I hurried it a bit.</font>

331
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:24,553
<font color="yellow">I think he handled it emotionally, and it is very unlike him.</font>

332
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:27,483
<font color="yellow">As his staff, you know well...</font>

333
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,883
<font color="yellow">that he's crucial to the company.</font>

334
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:35,983
<font color="yellow">So please make him change his mind.</font>

335
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,453
<font color="yellow">How can I do that?</font>

336
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,313
<font color="yellow">Director Han made the call.</font>

337
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,453
<font color="yellow">Do you think he will change his mind because...</font>

338
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,413
<font color="yellow">an assistant tells him to?</font>

339
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,583
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, aren't you his family?</font>

340
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,213
<font color="yellow">It's for his best interest.</font>

341
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,883
<font color="yellow">You owe a lot to his family, so you could do this.</font>

342
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:58,683
<font color="yellow">That is why I am saying that I don't have the right.</font>

343
00:24:59,753 --> 00:25:03,253
<font color="yellow">I think it's better if you approach him directly.</font>

344
00:25:04,813 --> 00:25:06,013
<font color="yellow">I'll get going now.</font>

345
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,083
<font color="yellow">I tried. I tried everything.</font>

346
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:17,583
<font color="yellow">But he won't listen to me. He doesn't even answer my call.</font>

347
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:22,253
<font color="yellow">How desperate should I be to be asking you for a favor?</font>

348
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:24,013
<font color="yellow">Can't you think of that?</font>

349
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,583
<font color="yellow">Do you not care if Seong Joon falls like this?</font>

350
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,483
<font color="yellow">If Seong Joon leaves the company like this,</font>

351
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:33,683
<font color="yellow">he will have no place in this industry.</font>

352
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:37,483
<font color="yellow">Besides, do you think my father will leave him alone?</font>

353
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:44,483
<font color="yellow">So you have to persuade him.</font>

354
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:46,553
<font color="yellow">Or help me so that he will meet me.</font>

355
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:07,053
<font color="yellow">The number you're calling is currently unavailable.</font>

356
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,413
<font color="yellow">It will be charged after the beep.</font>

357
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:12,583
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

358
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:15,353
<font color="yellow">I wondered if we could talk.</font>

359
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:20,013
<font color="yellow">I'm with Moong Chi right now. I will wait for you.</font>

360
00:26:42,983 --> 00:26:45,283
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, bark.</font>

361
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:48,683
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you barking today?</font>

362
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:51,053
<font color="yellow">Bark so that Seong Joon will come up.</font>

363
00:26:57,753 --> 00:26:59,083
<font color="yellow">It's good, isn't it?</font>

364
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:02,083
<font color="yellow">- It's good. - What do you think, Ji Hoon?</font>

365
00:27:02,753 --> 00:27:05,313
<font color="yellow">I think it's good. It's slightly unsanitary, but...</font>

366
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:06,483
<font color="yellow">Hey,</font>

367
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:10,683
<font color="yellow">if it's good, just say it's good.</font>

368
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:13,283
<font color="yellow">Stop being so picky.</font>

369
00:27:14,053 --> 00:27:15,853
<font color="yellow">Okay. It's good.</font>

370
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:20,983
<font color="yellow">That's right, Son. You have to smile like that at your age.</font>

371
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:24,153
<font color="yellow">Don't look so gloomy all the time. Okay?</font>

372
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:25,213
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

373
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,453
<font color="yellow">Should we go home?</font>

374
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:30,483
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - What is this?</font>

375
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:36,753
<font color="yellow">(Fishcake)</font>

376
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,513
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this?</font>

377
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,583
<font color="yellow">You eat so much,</font>

378
00:27:41,753 --> 00:27:44,613
<font color="yellow">so I got rid of everything in the refrigerator except for beans.</font>

379
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,753
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this? Tell me now.</font>

380
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,483
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I was too hungry.</font>

381
00:27:50,553 --> 00:27:53,683
<font color="yellow">So where did you get this?</font>

382
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:56,913
<font color="yellow">Will you go down first?</font>

383
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,053
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

384
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,013
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

385
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:12,413
<font color="yellow">I went down to my old house...</font>

386
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,583
<font color="yellow">and got it from the refrigerator there.</font>

387
00:28:15,283 --> 00:28:16,353
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

388
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:24,913
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook,</font>

389
00:28:25,313 --> 00:28:27,053
<font color="yellow">do you want this fish bread?</font>

390
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:29,213
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

391
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:31,483
<font color="yellow">You loved it...</font>

392
00:28:32,083 --> 00:28:33,783
<font color="yellow">when you were working.</font>

393
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,953
<font color="yellow">- When did I like it? - Anyway,</font>

394
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,383
<font color="yellow">I want to give this to you.</font>

395
00:28:40,613 --> 00:28:41,613
<font color="yellow">It's not for him.</font>

396
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:47,383
<font color="yellow">I will put it there. You should eat it.</font>

397
00:28:50,483 --> 00:28:53,653
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, are you joking with me right now?</font>

398
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:56,453
<font color="yellow">When did I like this?</font>

399
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:02,553
<font color="yellow">Do you even know what Chang Soo...</font>

400
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:05,813
<font color="yellow">stole from your place?</font>

401
00:29:05,983 --> 00:29:07,153
<font color="yellow">What did he steal?</font>

402
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,253
<font color="yellow">Hey, what did you get from my house?</font>

403
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:13,213
<font color="yellow">Fishcakes.</font>

404
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:16,453
<font color="yellow">Fishcakes?</font>

405
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:20,583
<font color="yellow">Stop crying. Stop.</font>

406
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:24,913
<font color="yellow">How can you lose weight when you're so impatient?</font>

407
00:29:25,653 --> 00:29:27,153
<font color="yellow">If you eat junk food,</font>

408
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:29,753
<font color="yellow">all the workouts you did become meaningless.</font>

409
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:31,353
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. Be quiet.</font>

410
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:33,353
<font color="yellow">- Stop. - Stop.</font>

411
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:36,853
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop hitting him.</font>

412
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,453
<font color="yellow">What if...</font>

413
00:29:43,583 --> 00:29:45,553
<font color="yellow">he eats a little?</font>

414
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,113
<font color="yellow">How can a big boy like him survive without eating?</font>

415
00:29:50,253 --> 00:29:52,313
<font color="yellow">You should stay out of it.</font>

416
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:55,313
<font color="yellow">Losing weight is good.</font>

417
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:58,383
<font color="yellow">But you have to feed him, too.</font>

418
00:29:58,383 --> 00:30:00,953
<font color="yellow">It will be too tough for him if you make him drop weights fast.</font>

419
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:03,613
<font color="yellow">He's not your son anymore.</font>

420
00:30:03,683 --> 00:30:05,383
<font color="yellow">So stay out of it.</font>

421
00:30:05,683 --> 00:30:08,083
<font color="yellow">- What? - Am I wrong?</font>

422
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,883
<font color="yellow">You've been raising him...</font>

423
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:14,683
<font color="yellow">with no discipline. You let him...</font>

424
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:17,483
<font color="yellow">do whatever he wants. That's why he became like this.</font>

425
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:20,883
<font color="yellow">He lost 3kg until now.</font>

426
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,683
<font color="yellow">But he gained it right back after eating this today.</font>

427
00:30:25,483 --> 00:30:27,053
<font color="yellow">Stop eating the fish bread.</font>

428
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:28,913
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

429
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,453
<font color="yellow">Put on some clothes.</font>

430
00:30:32,253 --> 00:30:34,353
<font color="yellow">You will lose all the calories you took in today before going to bed.</font>

431
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,653
<font color="yellow">Go and change into a training suit.</font>

432
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,753
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

433
00:30:49,453 --> 00:30:50,683
<font color="yellow">Hurry up!</font>

434
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:52,683
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

435
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:08,413
<font color="yellow">It bothers me a lot.</font>

436
00:31:09,813 --> 00:31:11,313
<font color="yellow">There's nothing we can do about it.</font>

437
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:16,053
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook has her own way to take care of her kid.</font>

438
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:19,453
<font color="yellow">We can't tell her what to do.</font>

439
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,983
<font color="yellow">Still, she's too mean and harsh.</font>

440
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,883
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Chang Soo is having a hard time.</font>

441
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:31,883
<font color="yellow">I want to move out as soon as possible.</font>

442
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,613
<font color="yellow">I think I'll feel better if Chang Soo is out of my sight.</font>

443
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:38,653
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

444
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:40,953
<font color="yellow">Sure, I bet you would feel better.</font>

445
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:45,953
<font color="yellow">I think you're right.</font>

446
00:31:48,183 --> 00:31:50,613
<font color="yellow">Try not to worry about Chang Soo for a while.</font>

447
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,153
<font color="yellow">That's for your own good.</font>

448
00:31:55,353 --> 00:31:56,553
<font color="yellow">He's so silly.</font>

449
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:58,653
<font color="yellow">He should have...</font>

450
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:01,983
<font color="yellow">been nicer to me when I was his mom.</font>

451
00:32:03,253 --> 00:32:04,413
<font color="yellow">It serves him right.</font>

452
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:06,413
<font color="yellow">How is Ji Hoon doing?</font>

453
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:08,583
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

454
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:12,683
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook raised him too strictly,</font>

455
00:32:13,613 --> 00:32:15,683
<font color="yellow">so he hardly opens his mind to me.</font>

456
00:32:16,453 --> 00:32:17,813
<font color="yellow">He doesn't smile a lot, either.</font>

457
00:32:18,453 --> 00:32:20,513
<font color="yellow">All he does is reading books.</font>

458
00:32:21,453 --> 00:32:23,553
<font color="yellow">I think he has some issue as well.</font>

459
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:28,483
<font color="yellow">I have no idea how I should raise kids.</font>

460
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:32,653
<font color="yellow">I can't believe...</font>

461
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:36,513
<font color="yellow">that my parents raised four of us this far.</font>

462
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,453
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

463
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:43,853
<font color="yellow">By the way, I just want...</font>

464
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:47,413
<font color="yellow">to grill a lot of pork belly,</font>

465
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,613
<font color="yellow">so Chang Soo can eat it to his heart's content.</font>

466
00:33:09,483 --> 00:33:11,883
<font color="yellow">Don't be too harsh to him.</font>

467
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,813
<font color="yellow">I'm not harsh at all.</font>

468
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:17,453
<font color="yellow">Did you think he'd change overnight?</font>

469
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,813
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon was different.</font>

470
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:23,483
<font color="yellow">Let's not talk about Ji Hoon anymore.</font>

471
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:24,913
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

472
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:28,083
<font color="yellow">Now all you care about is Chang Soo.</font>

473
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:33,083
<font color="yellow">How can you never bother to take care of me?</font>

474
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,953
<font color="yellow">How did the office contract go?</font>

475
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,813
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you should have asked that earlier?</font>

476
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:42,213
<font color="yellow">I signed the contract.</font>

477
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:43,913
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

478
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:45,853
<font color="yellow">My parents...</font>

479
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:49,213
<font color="yellow">didn't even give me a penny.</font>

480
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,913
<font color="yellow">So I found a cheap one through my friend.</font>

481
00:33:53,353 --> 00:33:54,613
<font color="yellow">So what will you do?</font>

482
00:33:55,153 --> 00:33:56,383
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

483
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:59,683
<font color="yellow">I was falsely fired from the show. I will succeed by any means.</font>

484
00:34:00,613 --> 00:34:01,653
<font color="yellow">Wait and see.</font>

485
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:03,683
<font color="yellow">I'll pay them back for the injustice...</font>

486
00:34:03,883 --> 00:34:05,983
<font color="yellow">and resentment I suffered because I didn't have wealthy parents.</font>

487
00:34:06,523 --> 00:34:08,683
<font color="yellow">So what should we do with Chang Soo?</font>

488
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,613
<font color="yellow">Please give up on him.</font>

489
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:11,883
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Stop.</font>

490
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:16,083
<font color="yellow">I'll succeed in my career and make a lot of money.</font>

491
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,613
<font color="yellow">I'll have him liposuction surgery with money...</font>

492
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:22,413
<font color="yellow">and appoint him a good post when he grows up.</font>

493
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:25,153
<font color="yellow">So please give up on him and raise him into a healthy person.</font>

494
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,883
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

495
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,483
<font color="yellow">He has to lose weight to become a healthy person.</font>

496
00:34:30,283 --> 00:34:32,353
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Is that true?</font>

497
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:34,023
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

498
00:34:34,023 --> 00:34:35,553
<font color="yellow">My dear.</font>

499
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:39,553
<font color="yellow">You must be very happy. Please take a seat.</font>

500
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:40,553
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

501
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,213
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

502
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:46,653
<font color="yellow">- I am very happy. - I see. My goodness.</font>

503
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,413
<font color="yellow">This rice cake is really tasty.</font>

504
00:34:52,153 --> 00:34:54,383
<font color="yellow">I never knew...</font>

505
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,253
<font color="yellow">your granddaughter would become a writer.</font>

506
00:34:57,883 --> 00:34:59,613
<font color="yellow">Me neither.</font>

507
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,813
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui really worked hard to become a writer for a long time.</font>

508
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:05,413
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she did.</font>

509
00:35:05,483 --> 00:35:08,783
<font color="yellow">Being a writer is really difficult.</font>

510
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,553
<font color="yellow">I want to ask writers...</font>

511
00:35:11,683 --> 00:35:15,183
<font color="yellow">how can they be full of great ideas.</font>

512
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:17,183
<font color="yellow">When I write letters,</font>

513
00:35:17,553 --> 00:35:20,983
<font color="yellow">I write, "How are you doing? I am doing fine."</font>

514
00:35:21,313 --> 00:35:23,313
<font color="yellow">After that, I have nothing left to write.</font>

515
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,883
<font color="yellow">So I just write,</font>

516
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,683
<font color="yellow">"Please take care."</font>

517
00:35:27,683 --> 00:35:30,683
<font color="yellow">And that's the end of my letter.</font>

518
00:35:30,883 --> 00:35:33,253
<font color="yellow">My friend found my letter half-hearted and got upset with me.</font>

519
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:34,913
<font color="yellow">Since then, she never calls me.</font>

520
00:35:36,653 --> 00:35:38,153
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

521
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,283
<font color="yellow">She was the closest friend...</font>

522
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:43,183
<font color="yellow">from high school.</font>

523
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:45,953
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

524
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,053
<font color="yellow">How can you be so mean? Why are you laughing?</font>

525
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:53,483
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

526
00:35:53,753 --> 00:35:56,853
<font color="yellow">You always have a wooden face,</font>

527
00:35:57,023 --> 00:36:00,113
<font color="yellow">so it's hard to read if you're happy or sad.</font>

528
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:02,983
<font color="yellow">You even told me that I shouldn't be petty...</font>

529
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:06,253
<font color="yellow">and just have followed the grim reaper.</font>

530
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:08,413
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that so cold-heartedly?</font>

531
00:36:08,683 --> 00:36:11,213
<font color="yellow">And now your granddaughter has become a writer,</font>

532
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:14,853
<font color="yellow">and you can't help but keep smiling.</font>

533
00:36:16,253 --> 00:36:18,683
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm too happy.</font>

534
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:21,813
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth, please stop laughing.</font>

535
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:23,483
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

536
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,313
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

537
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:30,813
<font color="yellow">What is that?</font>

538
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:33,413
<font color="yellow">Honey, come eat some rice cake.</font>

539
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:34,613
<font color="yellow">Who brought it?</font>

540
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:37,983
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui has become a writer.</font>

541
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,383
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

542
00:36:39,483 --> 00:36:42,253
<font color="yellow">So Ms. Oh brought this to celebrate.</font>

543
00:36:42,313 --> 00:36:43,753
<font color="yellow">That's great news.</font>

544
00:36:44,313 --> 00:36:45,483
<font color="yellow">Try some.</font>

545
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:51,453
<font color="yellow">- It's good. - Isn't it?</font>

546
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:54,313
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon taught her how to write recently.</font>

547
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,753
<font color="yellow">I think it worked.</font>

548
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,783
<font color="yellow">Right. Did Seong Joon go to work?</font>

549
00:36:58,023 --> 00:36:59,023
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

550
00:36:59,523 --> 00:37:00,523
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

551
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,553
<font color="yellow">He said he's on vacation. He's in his room now.</font>

552
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:04,953
<font color="yellow">Is he?</font>

553
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,483
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

554
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:16,853
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

555
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:19,683
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to work?</font>

556
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:23,183
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

557
00:37:24,413 --> 00:37:26,023
<font color="yellow">Put your coat on and follow me.</font>

558
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:33,413
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, here are your tasty coffee and cakes.</font>

559
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:35,883
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

560
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,883
<font color="yellow">By the way, your cafe is so cozy and nice.</font>

561
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:42,753
<font color="yellow">I know. I took care of it a lot.</font>

562
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:46,853
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms. Kim? Doesn't she always hang out with you?</font>

563
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:48,753
<font color="yellow">The one who owns Geumbit Academy.</font>

564
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:52,583
<font color="yellow">She closed the academy...</font>

565
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:55,023
<font color="yellow">and moved to other town.</font>

566
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,753
<font color="yellow">Really? That's sad.</font>

567
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:00,983
<font color="yellow">She has run the academy for about 20 years.</font>

568
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:02,183
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

569
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,953
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I hope this cafe thrives.</font>

570
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:08,483
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

571
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:11,853
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you want more coffee. You can have as much as you want.</font>

572
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:13,683
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

573
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:15,053
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

574
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:22,753
<font color="yellow">By the way, will Geum Ja be all right?</font>

575
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,413
<font color="yellow">I am so worried, too.</font>

576
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,453
<font color="yellow">I never thought she'd be arrested.</font>

577
00:38:26,453 --> 00:38:28,253
<font color="yellow">No one knew it.</font>

578
00:38:29,753 --> 00:38:31,153
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

579
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:33,953
<font color="yellow">Who do you think tipped the police off...</font>

580
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,383
<font color="yellow">about her fake account?</font>

581
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:36,913
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

582
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:40,813
<font color="yellow">I feel very uneasy after I heard what happened to her.</font>

583
00:38:43,053 --> 00:38:46,213
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you hear...</font>

584
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:50,153
<font color="yellow">that President Jo Moo Gyeom bought Geum Ja's building?</font>

585
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:52,383
<font color="yellow">Are you sure?</font>

586
00:38:52,683 --> 00:38:56,183
<font color="yellow">Did he have a bad memory in Bangbae-dong or something?</font>

587
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:57,983
<font color="yellow">Why does he buy up all the properties here?</font>

588
00:38:57,983 --> 00:38:59,113
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

589
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:03,183
<font color="yellow">The owner of Mina Supermarket and Geum Ja...</font>

590
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:06,453
<font color="yellow">are the witnesses of the drunk driving accident, right?</font>

591
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,353
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

592
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,313
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

593
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:16,453
<font color="yellow">Welcome...</font>

594
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:18,783
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

595
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:20,383
<font color="yellow">Is everything all right?</font>

596
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,583
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

597
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:23,023
<font color="yellow">I came to see what you're doing.</font>

598
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,583
<font color="yellow">I'm working at my cafe.</font>

599
00:39:24,613 --> 00:39:26,413
<font color="yellow">I had two customers so far.</font>

600
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:37,523
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

601
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:43,653
<font color="yellow">It's you.</font>

602
00:39:43,853 --> 00:39:45,683
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

603
00:39:46,213 --> 00:39:48,053
<font color="yellow">I guess you're here for some coffee.</font>

604
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:52,213
<font color="yellow">Yes. We just finished drinking.</font>

605
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:55,683
<font color="yellow">She's right. We finished our coffee.</font>

606
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:59,083
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the coffee, Jeong Eun.</font>

607
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:01,813
<font color="yellow">- We enjoyed it. - Ma'am, what's wrong?</font>

608
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,453
<font color="yellow">See you soon.</font>

609
00:40:03,523 --> 00:40:04,883
<font color="yellow">- We're leaving. - Okay.</font>

610
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:09,753
<font color="yellow">See you later.</font>

611
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:13,853
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

612
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:18,253
<font color="yellow">Do you want a cucumber sandwich and a cup of coffee?</font>

613
00:40:18,253 --> 00:40:19,383
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

614
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:27,023
<font color="yellow">I saw your uncle and Seong Joon.</font>

615
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:30,213
<font color="yellow">I think they were on their way to the mountain.</font>

616
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:32,683
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

617
00:40:33,253 --> 00:40:36,023
<font color="yellow">Why is he at home? Maybe it's his day off.</font>

618
00:40:37,453 --> 00:40:39,913
<font color="yellow">They seem to be very close to each other.</font>

619
00:40:40,153 --> 00:40:41,413
<font color="yellow">Of course, they are.</font>

620
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:43,953
<font color="yellow">My uncle loves Seong Joon so much.</font>

621
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:46,953
<font color="yellow">He's had greater affection...</font>

622
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:49,183
<font color="yellow">especially toward Seong Joon for a long time.</font>

623
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:52,153
<font color="yellow">- Why is that? - It's because he's handsome.</font>

624
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,313
<font color="yellow">Besides, he didn't cause any trouble growing up.</font>

625
00:40:59,313 --> 00:41:01,413
<font color="yellow">He listened to them.</font>

626
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,413
<font color="yellow">He was an exemplary son.</font>

627
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:07,183
<font color="yellow">That's why he likes Seong Joon,</font>

628
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:08,813
<font color="yellow">but...</font>

629
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:11,523
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon likes Uncle more.</font>

630
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,813
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

631
00:41:16,213 --> 00:41:19,313
<font color="yellow">All he cares about is his dad.</font>

632
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,683
<font color="yellow">He loves his dad a lot.</font>

633
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,583
<font color="yellow">There's a reason why.</font>

634
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:26,913
<font color="yellow">What reason?</font>

635
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,383
<font color="yellow">I am not certain if I should tell you this.</font>

636
00:41:38,113 --> 00:41:40,613
<font color="yellow">But you told me your story, too.</font>

637
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:49,983
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon was...</font>

638
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:55,913
<font color="yellow">born out of wedlock.</font>

639
00:41:58,983 --> 00:41:59,983
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

640
00:42:01,883 --> 00:42:04,183
<font color="yellow">It happened when he was seven years old.</font>

641
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,413
<font color="yellow">I was only eight and it was hectic for me, too.</font>

642
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,683
<font color="yellow">That's when he came to our house for the first time.</font>

643
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:16,813
<font color="yellow">When I think back, that day was such a chaotic day.</font>

644
00:42:18,083 --> 00:42:19,983
<font color="yellow">My uncle doesn't look like...</font>

645
00:42:19,983 --> 00:42:22,583
<font color="yellow">he would cheat on his wife.</font>

646
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:28,683
<font color="yellow">My aunt cried and screamed.</font>

647
00:42:29,353 --> 00:42:31,083
<font color="yellow">She said she was going to divorce him.</font>

648
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:34,413
<font color="yellow">It was a total chaos. Somehow, they worked it out and...</font>

649
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:35,913
<font color="yellow">it is what it is now.</font>

650
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,853
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon grew up well.</font>

651
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,453
<font color="yellow">Everyone's relieved that he did.</font>

652
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:46,053
<font color="yellow">That's why Uncle and Seong Joon have...</font>

653
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:48,183
<font color="yellow">a special relationship.</font>

654
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,253
<font color="yellow">Your family story is quite interesting.</font>

655
00:43:00,753 --> 00:43:02,953
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking about? Your girlfriend is right here.</font>

656
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:11,883
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have dinner at my house?</font>

657
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,113
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

658
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,183
<font color="yellow">Come at 7pm.</font>

659
00:43:20,023 --> 00:43:21,023
<font color="yellow">I'm going.</font>

660
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:23,483
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

661
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,953
<font color="yellow">Good bye. I will be there at 7pm.</font>

662
00:43:45,113 --> 00:43:46,113
<font color="yellow">Are you not tired?</font>

663
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,783
<font color="yellow">I climbed more mountains than you.</font>

664
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:54,553
<font color="yellow">- Let's take a break here. - Okay.</font>

665
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:03,753
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some rice cake? - What kind of rice cake is it?</font>

666
00:44:04,753 --> 00:44:06,853
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh won...</font>

667
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,813
<font color="yellow">some sort of script competition.</font>

668
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:10,953
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

669
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:13,583
<font color="yellow">That's why her grandmother gave out the rice cake.</font>

670
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:15,383
<font color="yellow">Your mom packed it for us. Try it.</font>

671
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:16,883
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

672
00:44:19,113 --> 00:44:20,983
<font color="yellow">But why did you resign?</font>

673
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:23,183
<font color="yellow">Just because.</font>

674
00:44:23,753 --> 00:44:26,053
<font color="yellow">It's because I wanted to be free.</font>

675
00:44:27,353 --> 00:44:28,653
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense.</font>

676
00:44:30,483 --> 00:44:31,613
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

677
00:44:33,883 --> 00:44:35,483
<font color="yellow">Did they...</font>

678
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,613
<font color="yellow">find fault...</font>

679
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:41,483
<font color="yellow">with you because you were born out of wedlock?</font>

680
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,283
<font color="yellow">No, they didn't.</font>

681
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:47,253
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you resign? She visited us not long ago.</font>

682
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:49,383
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem logical.</font>

683
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:52,753
<font color="yellow">- We are not getting married. - Then why did she visit us?</font>

684
00:44:53,153 --> 00:44:54,553
<font color="yellow">She wanted to.</font>

685
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:58,483
<font color="yellow">She visited us because you led her on.</font>

686
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,383
<font color="yellow">I'm repenting.</font>

687
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:03,853
<font color="yellow">Even if that happened. But still.</font>

688
00:45:04,013 --> 00:45:06,013
<font color="yellow">If you resign like this,</font>

689
00:45:06,513 --> 00:45:09,153
<font color="yellow">putting aside the fact she's hurt,</font>

690
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,383
<font color="yellow">what will happen to your subordinates who depended on you?</font>

691
00:45:13,113 --> 00:45:15,313
<font color="yellow">The same goes to the company who trusted you and gave you the job.</font>

692
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:17,383
<font color="yellow">This is not how you should treat them.</font>

693
00:45:18,113 --> 00:45:19,183
<font color="yellow">I'm aware of it.</font>

694
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:22,413
<font color="yellow">You are aware of it, but this is how you handled it?</font>

695
00:45:28,113 --> 00:45:29,613
<font color="yellow">I wished...</font>

696
00:45:30,113 --> 00:45:33,083
<font color="yellow">all my life that you'd grow up well.</font>

697
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:35,883
<font color="yellow">I worried...</font>

698
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,883
<font color="yellow">if you would turn out well...</font>

699
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:41,583
<font color="yellow">or if you would turn rebellious.</font>

700
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:45,253
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

701
00:45:47,013 --> 00:45:49,153
<font color="yellow">unlike your brothers,</font>

702
00:45:49,453 --> 00:45:51,583
<font color="yellow">you never caused troubles.</font>

703
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,653
<font color="yellow">As I saw you matured into a decent individual,</font>

704
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,813
<font color="yellow">I was grateful.</font>

705
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:01,813
<font color="yellow">I'm going to feel grateful...</font>

706
00:46:02,353 --> 00:46:04,253
<font color="yellow">until the day I die.</font>

707
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:07,453
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

708
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:11,613
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - If there's anything that will...</font>

709
00:46:12,613 --> 00:46:14,483
<font color="yellow">help you, I will do it no matter what it is.</font>

710
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:18,683
<font color="yellow">I can sacrifice my life for you.</font>

711
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:21,383
<font color="yellow">Father, why are you talking like this?</font>

712
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:25,153
<font color="yellow">If you resigned because they rejected you...</font>

713
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:28,053
<font color="yellow">since you were born out of wedlock,</font>

714
00:46:30,253 --> 00:46:32,283
<font color="yellow">if this is the case, it will break my heart.</font>

715
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:36,083
<font color="yellow">Father, it's not true. I didn't resign because of that.</font>

716
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:38,153
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you?</font>

717
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:41,753
<font color="yellow">My son, Seong Joon. You are not under qualified</font>

718
00:46:41,913 --> 00:46:43,553
<font color="yellow">Why would you need to resign?</font>

719
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:46,983
<font color="yellow">It's breaking my heart.</font>

720
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:52,313
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

721
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:20,413
<font color="yellow">What a misfortune. This is a chaos.</font>

722
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:24,483
<font color="yellow">We have a lot of work to do. How can he resign like this?</font>

723
00:47:25,113 --> 00:47:27,753
<font color="yellow">He took care of all the urgent assignments, though.</font>

724
00:47:27,853 --> 00:47:31,553
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter. There's no one to lead the team afterwards.</font>

725
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,613
<font color="yellow">I mean I do hate him,</font>

726
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:37,383
<font color="yellow">but no one is as good as he is.</font>

727
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,283
<font color="yellow">I only admit that image of him.</font>

728
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:43,383
<font color="yellow">By the way, does it mean Director Bang and Director Han are over?</font>

729
00:47:44,483 --> 00:47:46,553
<font color="yellow">Writer Jo. Director Han is...</font>

730
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:48,853
<font color="yellow">on a business trip overseas.</font>

731
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,613
<font color="yellow">It's hard to get a hold of him.</font>

732
00:47:50,813 --> 00:47:53,853
<font color="yellow">- What are we going to do? - No, it's not true.</font>

733
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:55,553
<font color="yellow">We will be able to reach him soon.</font>

734
00:47:55,613 --> 00:47:58,883
<font color="yellow">He's in Shanghai. We are in different time zones.</font>

735
00:47:59,983 --> 00:48:02,683
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I will tell him to contact you right away.</font>

736
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:04,513
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

737
00:48:07,083 --> 00:48:10,913
<font color="yellow">What? Different time zones? It's only an hour difference.</font>

738
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:12,353
<font color="yellow">What was I supposed to do?</font>

739
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:15,283
<font color="yellow">She's saying that she will only work with Director Han.</font>

740
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:18,953
<font color="yellow">- That you should have... - I was confused. I was lying.</font>

741
00:48:20,153 --> 00:48:21,513
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy.</font>

742
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:25,653
<font color="yellow">Seriously, why did he resign out of the blue?</font>

743
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:27,513
<font color="yellow">That's what I want to ask.</font>

744
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:31,753
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do? We have to resolve this somehow.</font>

745
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:35,053
<font color="yellow">Without Director Han, we are ruined.</font>

746
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:38,383
<font color="yellow">Signing the writer and airing it on a TV station weren't the hard parts.</font>

747
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,583
<font color="yellow">What follows is more challenging.</font>

748
00:48:41,683 --> 00:48:43,683
<font color="yellow">This is a problem.</font>

749
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:48,613
<font color="yellow">Han Seong Joon resigned?</font>

750
00:48:50,083 --> 00:48:51,113
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

751
00:48:52,213 --> 00:48:53,453
<font color="yellow">How absurd.</font>

752
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:56,383
<font color="yellow">Bring me his resignation letter. I will accept it.</font>

753
00:48:56,513 --> 00:48:57,983
<font color="yellow">I will destroy him.</font>

754
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:00,313
<font color="yellow">We need to bring him back.</font>

755
00:49:00,413 --> 00:49:02,083
<font color="yellow">He's not worth it.</font>

756
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:04,053
<font color="yellow">It's because I was stubborn.</font>

757
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,753
<font color="yellow">He wasn't interested in a marriage.</font>

758
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,353
<font color="yellow">That means all he cared about was work.</font>

759
00:49:09,653 --> 00:49:12,083
<font color="yellow">If we lose him, we will suffer a heavy blow.</font>

760
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:15,183
<font color="yellow">Writer Jo said she'll terminate the contract if he doesn't come back.</font>

761
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:18,283
<font color="yellow">There are many qualified directors who can replace him.</font>

762
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:20,853
<font color="yellow">He's acting arrogant because...</font>

763
00:49:20,953 --> 00:49:23,183
<font color="yellow">you keep holding on to him.</font>

764
00:49:23,513 --> 00:49:26,783
<font color="yellow">You're right. I acknowledge my mistakes.</font>

765
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:30,653
<font color="yellow">But saving the company takes precedence now.</font>

766
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:33,053
<font color="yellow">I can't accept his resignation, Dad.</font>

767
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:35,853
<font color="yellow">Please. Trust me one more time.</font>

768
00:49:35,983 --> 00:49:38,383
<font color="yellow">- You can't. - Dad.</font>

769
00:49:39,053 --> 00:49:42,553
<font color="yellow">How dare he submit a letter of resignation?</font>

770
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,813
<font color="yellow">I'm going to...</font>

771
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,253
<font color="yellow">bury him somewhere.</font>

772
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:50,883
<font color="yellow">If you do that, then I will die with him.</font>

773
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:53,083
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Why?</font>

774
00:49:53,313 --> 00:49:55,253
<font color="yellow">Do you think I can't?</font>

775
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:58,853
<font color="yellow">I will die if you hurt him.</font>

776
00:49:59,283 --> 00:50:00,783
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die.</font>

777
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:08,513
<font color="yellow">Is this all?</font>

778
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:11,513
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

779
00:50:11,513 --> 00:50:13,813
<font color="yellow">This is too light.</font>

780
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:16,683
<font color="yellow">I don't have a mink coat that can't be crumpled...</font>

781
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,213
<font color="yellow">or jewelries.</font>

782
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:20,213
<font color="yellow">It makes sense I don't have a lot of belongings.</font>

783
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:22,383
<font color="yellow">Where should I put these?</font>

784
00:50:22,683 --> 00:50:26,153
<font color="yellow">If you have a drawer, let me have one.</font>

785
00:50:26,883 --> 00:50:28,683
<font color="yellow">Please come this way.</font>

786
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:33,953
<font color="yellow">Mom. I'm here.</font>

787
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:42,853
<font color="yellow">- Mom. I'm here. - Yes, you are here.</font>

788
00:50:43,013 --> 00:50:45,213
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were here, Ms. Oh.</font>

789
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,513
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I am. Hello. - Hi.</font>

790
00:50:47,983 --> 00:50:49,213
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

791
00:50:50,683 --> 00:50:51,853
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

792
00:50:52,113 --> 00:50:56,113
<font color="yellow">- You can't do this. - Stay out of it.</font>

793
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,053
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Mom.</font>

794
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,783
<font color="yellow">You're already living with your in-laws in the same building.</font>

795
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:02,553
<font color="yellow">Are you going to share a room with her now?</font>

796
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,913
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui became a writer.</font>

797
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:07,583
<font color="yellow">You should congratulate her,</font>

798
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:10,313
<font color="yellow">but that doesn't have anything to do with this.</font>

799
00:51:10,483 --> 00:51:13,483
<font color="yellow">That old woman stays with Dong Hui.</font>

800
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:15,753
<font color="yellow">Then she won't be able to write.</font>

801
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:18,183
<font color="yellow">What is this about?</font>

802
00:51:18,383 --> 00:51:20,483
<font color="yellow">If she becomes a famous writer,</font>

803
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:22,113
<font color="yellow">are you going to ask her...</font>

804
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,683
<font color="yellow">to give you a job as an actress?</font>

805
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:25,753
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

806
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:28,613
<font color="yellow">If they need someone to play a woman Song Joong Ki falls in love with,</font>

807
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:29,683
<font color="yellow">I'm going to do it.</font>

808
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:30,883
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

809
00:51:31,613 --> 00:51:33,853
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - Besides, I'm scared.</font>

810
00:51:33,853 --> 00:51:36,013
<font color="yellow">You come by every evening,</font>

811
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,883
<font color="yellow">but I'm all alone at night.</font>

812
00:51:38,183 --> 00:51:41,283
<font color="yellow">The grim reaper keeps showing up in my dreams these days.</font>

813
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,453
<font color="yellow">Hey. Look at Ms. Oh's face. If the grim reaper comes...</font>

814
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:47,653
<font color="yellow">and sees her face, it will run away.</font>

815
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:49,413
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

816
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:52,483
<font color="yellow">What a jerk.</font>

817
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:56,413
<font color="yellow">I asked him to backstitch it and he did such a bad job.</font>

818
00:51:58,083 --> 00:52:00,113
<font color="yellow">Also, she made a promise with me.</font>

819
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:04,253
<font color="yellow">If the grim reaper comes, she will follow it instead of me.</font>

820
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:05,983
<font color="yellow">So to speak,</font>

821
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:08,253
<font color="yellow">she switched her ticket number with me.</font>

822
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:10,353
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, when you go to a bank,</font>

823
00:52:10,353 --> 00:52:12,983
<font color="yellow">a busy person asks you to switch the ticket numbers.</font>

824
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:14,113
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

825
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:16,153
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling at me?</font>

826
00:52:16,153 --> 00:52:17,183
<font color="yellow">Anyhow,</font>

827
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:20,013
<font color="yellow">don't you live with her,</font>

828
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:23,413
<font color="yellow">have a fight again, and call me.</font>

829
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:24,853
<font color="yellow">Do you hear me?</font>

830
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:26,483
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

831
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,553
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon. Please put it over here.</font>

832
00:52:35,553 --> 00:52:37,253
<font color="yellow">All right. Here we go.</font>

833
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:38,913
<font color="yellow">Is your back okay?</font>

834
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:40,283
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

835
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,853
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since you removed your cast.</font>

836
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:45,183
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>

837
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:47,953
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Don't you worry about it.</font>

838
00:52:48,253 --> 00:52:51,653
<font color="yellow">If I can help you become a good writer,</font>

839
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:53,053
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't wish more.</font>

840
00:52:54,113 --> 00:52:56,783
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon. Thank you so much.</font>

841
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:58,353
<font color="yellow">I know things are hard for you, too.</font>

842
00:52:58,353 --> 00:53:00,383
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking care of me.</font>

843
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:02,953
<font color="yellow">Don't say that. Of course I should take care of you.</font>

844
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,583
<font color="yellow">You're my only sister-in-law. Am I right?</font>

845
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:11,383
<font color="yellow">Is this good enough to be your workroom?</font>

846
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:38,053
<font color="yellow">I'm starving.</font>

847
00:53:44,153 --> 00:53:45,413
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

848
00:53:46,813 --> 00:53:47,913
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

849
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:50,083
<font color="yellow">Eat this, Chang Soo.</font>

850
00:54:06,753 --> 00:54:07,783
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

851
00:54:07,813 --> 00:54:10,013
<font color="yellow">It's snack I got from the preschool today.</font>

852
00:54:10,283 --> 00:54:12,453
<font color="yellow">I didn't eat it because I wanted...</font>

853
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:14,183
<font color="yellow">to give it to you.</font>

854
00:54:14,413 --> 00:54:16,953
<font color="yellow">Ah In. Thank you so much.</font>

855
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:20,283
<font color="yellow">Hang in there, Chang Soo!</font>

856
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,483
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

857
00:54:35,113 --> 00:54:37,553
<font color="yellow">Aunt Hee Sook.</font>

858
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:39,613
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

859
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:43,813
<font color="yellow">I don't want to scold you.</font>

860
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:46,583
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

861
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,683
<font color="yellow">No. You shouldn't be saying that.</font>

862
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:51,383
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that you want...</font>

863
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,253
<font color="yellow">to help your brother.</font>

864
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,453
<font color="yellow">- What? - However,</font>

865
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:58,913
<font color="yellow">I don't have a daughter, right?</font>

866
00:54:59,183 --> 00:55:01,513
<font color="yellow">And I really...</font>

867
00:55:01,513 --> 00:55:04,353
<font color="yellow">adore you, Ah In.</font>

868
00:55:07,153 --> 00:55:10,113
<font color="yellow">I'm raising your brother, Chang Soo.</font>

869
00:55:10,553 --> 00:55:12,253
<font color="yellow">Maybe...</font>

870
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:17,253
<font color="yellow">I should raise you as well, my dear Ah In.</font>

871
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,353
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

872
00:55:21,513 --> 00:55:22,883
<font color="yellow">My dear Ah In.</font>

873
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:27,783
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if you have to live with me?</font>

874
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:37,953
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me. I won't do it again.</font>

875
00:55:55,683 --> 00:55:57,483
<font color="yellow">- Chang Soo. - Dad.</font>

876
00:55:58,453 --> 00:55:59,753
<font color="yellow">Here. Eat this.</font>

877
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,113
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

878
00:56:16,213 --> 00:56:17,313
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

879
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:33,013
<font color="yellow">"Anna Karenina", a novel by Leo Tolstoy is...</font>

880
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:35,313
<font color="yellow">evaluated as the most artistic work...</font>

881
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:38,553
<font color="yellow">of Tolstoy among his many other novels.</font>

882
00:56:39,213 --> 00:56:40,653
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

883
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:43,413
<font color="yellow">It's been so long since I read a book.</font>

884
00:56:45,513 --> 00:56:48,013
<font color="yellow">This novel depicts...</font>

885
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,513
<font color="yellow">Russian aristocratic circles...</font>

886
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,853
<font color="yellow">in 1870s.</font>

887
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:56,783
<font color="yellow">And it is the background of Anna's love affair.</font>

888
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,283
<font color="yellow">Do you know how the novel begins?</font>

889
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,453
<font color="yellow">Look, Hee Sook.</font>

890
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:04,913
<font color="yellow">Like I said, it's been so long since I read a book.</font>

891
00:57:06,783 --> 00:57:10,513
<font color="yellow">"Happy families are all alike."</font>

892
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,353
<font color="yellow">"Every unhappy family..."</font>

893
00:57:12,913 --> 00:57:16,583
<font color="yellow">"is unhappy in its own way."</font>

894
00:57:17,053 --> 00:57:18,353
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

895
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:22,853
<font color="yellow">I'd like to change these words...</font>

896
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,813
<font color="yellow">to something that reflects my situation today.</font>

897
00:57:28,683 --> 00:57:29,953
<font color="yellow">How?</font>

898
00:57:30,053 --> 00:57:33,783
<font color="yellow">Slim kids are pretty in their own way...</font>

899
00:57:34,453 --> 00:57:37,083
<font color="yellow">while fat kids are look alike...</font>

900
00:57:37,083 --> 00:57:39,453
<font color="yellow">for only one reason.</font>

901
00:57:40,853 --> 00:57:41,913
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

902
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:45,013
<font color="yellow">Do you want Chang Soo to look like...</font>

903
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:47,313
<font color="yellow">all the other fat kids?</font>

904
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:49,683
<font color="yellow">No. I don't, Hee Sook.</font>

905
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,153
<font color="yellow">If you had been my husband,</font>

906
00:57:54,283 --> 00:57:58,353
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't have let you off so easy.</font>

907
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:01,553
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

908
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:03,913
<font color="yellow">I can never be your husband.</font>

909
00:58:04,353 --> 00:58:07,083
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Forgive me, Hee Sook.</font>

910
00:58:07,983 --> 00:58:09,053
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

911
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:12,583
<font color="yellow">going to give Chang Soo food again?</font>

912
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:14,113
<font color="yellow">No. No.</font>

913
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,613
<font color="yellow">I'll never do that again.</font>

914
00:58:23,913 --> 00:58:25,783
<font color="yellow">Thank you for inviting me.</font>

915
00:58:26,683 --> 00:58:29,113
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what to wear,</font>

916
00:58:29,183 --> 00:58:30,683
<font color="yellow">so I just wore this.</font>

917
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:37,853
<font color="yellow">Invite?</font>

918
00:58:38,483 --> 00:58:40,153
<font color="yellow">It's not like this is your first time being here.</font>

919
00:58:40,853 --> 00:58:42,683
<font color="yellow">You came to my place so often as if it's your own.</font>

920
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,753
<font color="yellow">Now you're thanking me for inviting you.</font>

921
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:49,683
<font color="yellow">Still, when a man invites a woman to his place for dinner,</font>

922
00:58:49,683 --> 00:58:51,953
<font color="yellow">it must mean something more than just dinner.</font>

923
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:54,953
<font color="yellow">Don't expect too much.</font>

924
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:58,883
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to cook for you since I couldn't when we were camping.</font>

925
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,413
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

926
00:59:01,013 --> 00:59:03,653
<font color="yellow">the book said the first stage of a man and woman...</font>

927
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:06,983
<font color="yellow">getting close is the man inviting his girlfriend to his house.</font>

928
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,213
<font color="yellow">Throw that book away immediately.</font>

929
00:59:13,213 --> 00:59:15,753
<font color="yellow">Still, you brought me a nice bottle of wine.</font>

930
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:17,353
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

931
00:59:18,753 --> 00:59:20,753
<font color="yellow">- Do you like pasta? - Yes.</font>

932
00:59:28,553 --> 00:59:29,613
<font color="yellow">You don't have to come.</font>

933
00:59:30,153 --> 00:59:31,383
<font color="yellow">I'm good at cooking, too.</font>

934
00:59:32,453 --> 00:59:33,883
<font color="yellow">I know you are.</font>

935
00:59:35,153 --> 00:59:38,283
<font color="yellow">But you should just rest. You've been standing all day long.</font>

936
00:59:39,113 --> 00:59:40,253
<font color="yellow">Sit over there.</font>

937
00:59:42,753 --> 00:59:43,783
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

938
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:48,683
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

939
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:50,853
<font color="yellow">you look good in that dress.</font>

940
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:53,153
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

941
00:59:56,053 --> 00:59:57,213
<font color="yellow">You look good in that dress.</font>

942
01:00:00,153 --> 01:00:02,813
<font color="yellow">I see. Thank you.</font>

943
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,053
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

944
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,013
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

945
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:28,213
<font color="yellow">Are you on a date with her?</font>

946
01:00:30,353 --> 01:00:31,353
<font color="yellow">I can talk.</font>

947
01:00:31,883 --> 01:00:34,453
<font color="yellow">Han Seong Joon handed in his resignation a few days ago.</font>

948
01:00:35,013 --> 01:00:37,913
<font color="yellow">I think we may have to change our plans.</font>

949
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:43,013
<font color="yellow">Did you find out anything about his birthmother?</font>

950
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,883
<font color="yellow">Actually, I couldn't find any information.</font>

951
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:49,113
<font color="yellow">I think we should look into it from another direction.</font>

952
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:53,013
<font color="yellow">Okay. Look into it further, then.</font>

953
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,783
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll have a good time with her.</font>

954
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:58,853
<font color="yellow">Listen, it's not what you think.</font>

955
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:12,753
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Why did you go into your bedroom to answer the call?</font>

956
01:01:15,313 --> 01:01:17,853
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing. - Are you hiding something?</font>

957
01:01:18,683 --> 01:01:19,983
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

958
01:01:30,683 --> 01:01:31,783
<font color="yellow">It's delicious.</font>

959
01:01:35,653 --> 01:01:37,683
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you get...</font>

960
01:01:38,613 --> 01:01:42,583
<font color="yellow">double locks on your bedroom door? I've been curious.</font>

961
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:48,783
<font color="yellow">Why are you curious about that?</font>

962
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:51,813
<font color="yellow">Besides, you have a model of our neighborhood.</font>

963
01:01:52,113 --> 01:01:55,113
<font color="yellow">It looked so real with the lights and everything.</font>

964
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:01,483
<font color="yellow">Did you forget what I do for a living? I'm an architect.</font>

965
01:02:04,113 --> 01:02:05,353
<font color="yellow">I suppose.</font>

966
01:02:09,253 --> 01:02:10,753
<font color="yellow">I'm a neat freak.</font>

967
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,383
<font color="yellow">I really hate when other people touch my things.</font>

968
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,513
<font color="yellow">When I was in college in the States,</font>

969
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:19,983
<font color="yellow">my roommate kept touching my things.</font>

970
01:02:20,383 --> 01:02:21,753
<font color="yellow">So I smacked him.</font>

971
01:02:22,913 --> 01:02:25,953
<font color="yellow">Both of us got kicked out of the dormitory because of that.</font>

972
01:02:27,353 --> 01:02:29,683
<font color="yellow">You should learn to control your temper.</font>

973
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:31,883
<font color="yellow">Can't you be more easygoing?</font>

974
01:02:33,253 --> 01:02:34,883
<font color="yellow">Don't force it on me just because you can.</font>

975
01:02:36,313 --> 01:02:39,983
<font color="yellow">Anyway, the most easygoing guy I've ever known is...</font>

976
01:02:40,313 --> 01:02:41,653
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

977
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:48,853
<font color="yellow">But I guess Seong Joon must have been very lonely.</font>

978
01:02:51,683 --> 01:02:54,413
<font color="yellow">His mother and brothers aren't...</font>

979
01:02:54,583 --> 01:02:56,053
<font color="yellow">his real family.</font>

980
01:02:56,383 --> 01:02:59,113
<font color="yellow">No. It was never like that.</font>

981
01:02:59,213 --> 01:03:01,283
<font color="yellow">My family isn't that kind of people,</font>

982
01:03:01,513 --> 01:03:03,753
<font color="yellow">and Seong Joon has been a very good kid.</font>

983
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:08,083
<font color="yellow">Besides, he's smart and reliable.</font>

984
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:11,453
<font color="yellow">Anyway, he was just different from the beginning.</font>

985
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:15,953
<font color="yellow">We understood each other. He has no mother, and I have no father.</font>

986
01:03:17,983 --> 01:03:19,683
<font color="yellow">He still must have been lonely.</font>

987
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,283
<font color="yellow">But he didn't show it. That's what made me feel bad for him.</font>

988
01:03:29,483 --> 01:03:31,653
<font color="yellow">Do you know who his birthmother is?</font>

989
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:35,683
<font color="yellow">No. We've never seen her,</font>

990
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,883
<font color="yellow">or talked about her.</font>

991
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:41,953
<font color="yellow">It's like a taboo subject in our house.</font>

992
01:03:48,913 --> 01:03:51,553
<font color="yellow">Come in. Be quiet, Moong Chi.</font>

993
01:03:51,683 --> 01:03:54,413
<font color="yellow">Don't bark. Stay quiet.</font>

994
01:04:03,753 --> 01:04:04,913
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

995
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:06,683
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

996
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:10,753
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing there like that?</font>

997
01:04:10,953 --> 01:04:13,283
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to work harder from now on?</font>

998
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:17,113
<font color="yellow">You're now one step closer to your dream of being a writer...</font>

999
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:20,083
<font color="yellow">who makes a lot of money and meets handsome actors...</font>

1000
01:04:20,113 --> 01:04:21,253
<font color="yellow">every day.</font>

1001
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:24,783
<font color="yellow">Congratulations. I really mean it.</font>

1002
01:04:26,113 --> 01:04:29,153
<font color="yellow">- Director Han. - I'm not a director anymore.</font>

1003
01:04:33,413 --> 01:04:35,553
<font color="yellow">It feels so empty without you.</font>

1004
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:39,783
<font color="yellow">Everyone would feel that way at first.</font>

1005
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:42,883
<font color="yellow">I'm not talking about other people.</font>

1006
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,353
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about me.</font>

1007
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,883
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you can do great even without me.</font>

1008
01:04:56,253 --> 01:04:57,453
<font color="yellow">I know I can.</font>

1009
01:04:58,483 --> 01:05:00,613
<font color="yellow">But when you were there,</font>

1010
01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:04,253
<font color="yellow">I felt like I had a reliable supporter. I just never told you.</font>

1011
01:05:05,453 --> 01:05:06,513
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

1012
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:11,013
<font color="yellow">You asked me what my dream was, right?</font>

1013
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,953
<font color="yellow">What's your dream?</font>

1014
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,053
<font color="yellow">I've been curious for a long time.</font>

1015
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,183
<font color="yellow">My dream is to make heartwarming dramas...</font>

1016
01:05:24,613 --> 01:05:26,583
<font color="yellow">and show them to many people.</font>

1017
01:05:31,413 --> 01:05:34,513
<font color="yellow">Why? Was that an unexpected answer from a producer?</font>

1018
01:05:35,683 --> 01:05:38,113
<font color="yellow">No. I'm just happy.</font>

1019
01:05:38,153 --> 01:05:39,753
<font color="yellow">You and I share the same dreams.</font>

1020
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,613
<font color="yellow">I don't write the scripts.</font>

1021
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:47,053
<font color="yellow">Of course. I don't produce dramas, either.</font>

1022
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:53,053
<font color="yellow">Are you going to give up your dreams, then?</font>

1023
01:05:57,683 --> 01:06:00,553
<font color="yellow">Director Bang came to see me yesterday.</font>

1024
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:03,053
<font color="yellow">She asked me to stop you from resigning.</font>

1025
01:06:03,753 --> 01:06:05,683
<font color="yellow">She asked me, a person with no power.</font>

1026
01:06:06,953 --> 01:06:07,953
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

1027
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:12,483
<font color="yellow">I know this isn't something I can stop.</font>

1028
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:15,383
<font color="yellow">But I'm just worried that...</font>

1029
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:20,313
<font color="yellow">you might never be able to work in this field if you quit now.</font>

1030
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:22,313
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm worried about.</font>

1031
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,613
<font color="yellow">I guess Director Bang told you about that stuff, too.</font>

1032
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:30,613
<font color="yellow">If you think about it, she's not wrong.</font>

1033
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:33,313
<font color="yellow">You quit before finishing the work you started.</font>

1034
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:37,083
<font color="yellow">You told me to be more confident,</font>

1035
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:39,113
<font color="yellow">and not to give up my dream as a writer.</font>

1036
01:06:40,783 --> 01:06:43,113
<font color="yellow">What I can say to you is...</font>

1037
01:06:43,853 --> 01:06:44,853
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

1038
01:06:45,953 --> 01:06:48,183
<font color="yellow">What I can say to you as a friend who shares...</font>

1039
01:06:48,653 --> 01:06:50,513
<font color="yellow">the same dreams as yours is...</font>

1040
01:06:52,453 --> 01:06:54,083
<font color="yellow">do not give up.</font>

1041
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:58,313
<font color="yellow">Whatever the reason is, I don't think you should give up...</font>

1042
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:00,683
<font color="yellow">the dreams you have had for so long.</font>

1043
01:07:06,513 --> 01:07:09,653
<font color="yellow">Also, I have a favor to ask of you.</font>

1044
01:07:10,153 --> 01:07:12,753
<font color="yellow">You have to do this for me.</font>

1045
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,113
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

1046
01:07:14,513 --> 01:07:17,853
<font color="yellow">I want to work harder from now on,</font>

1047
01:07:17,983 --> 01:07:21,113
<font color="yellow">and become the greatest writer in this country in 10 years.</font>

1048
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:25,253
<font color="yellow">Would you produce my drama then?</font>

1049
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,483
<font color="yellow">If you do, it will be...</font>

1050
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:32,453
<font color="yellow">another memory between us.</font>

1051
01:07:55,753 --> 01:07:58,553
<font color="yellow">How many women have you seduced like this?</font>

1052
01:07:59,983 --> 01:08:02,213
<font color="yellow">- What? - It's fine.</font>

1053
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:05,083
<font color="yellow">I'm not someone who dwells on the past.</font>

1054
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,253
<font color="yellow">Didn't the book that you're reading say...</font>

1055
01:08:10,683 --> 01:08:14,113
<font color="yellow">a couple shouldn't ask about each other's past?</font>

1056
01:08:16,153 --> 01:08:19,013
<font color="yellow">Am I not supposed to? I haven't finished reading it yet.</font>

1057
01:08:24,253 --> 01:08:26,413
<font color="yellow">I think I had too much wine.</font>

1058
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:28,183
<font color="yellow">I should try to sober up.</font>

1059
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:37,183
<font color="yellow">What should I do with those two?</font>

1060
01:08:38,183 --> 01:08:39,453
<font color="yellow">The way I see it,</font>

1061
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:41,883
<font color="yellow">they like each other.</font>

1062
01:08:43,783 --> 01:08:46,153
<font color="yellow">I hope things go well between them.</font>

1063
01:09:06,823 --> 01:09:08,383
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1064
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:11,553
<font color="yellow">I actually have a brother who is around the same age...</font>

1065
01:09:11,653 --> 01:09:13,013
<font color="yellow">as you, Seong Joon.</font>

1066
01:09:14,413 --> 01:09:15,483
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

1067
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:19,553
<font color="yellow">I think I can find your mother now.</font>

1068
01:09:19,783 --> 01:09:21,823
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much...</font>

1069
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:25,353
<font color="yellow">for raising me and taking care of me so far.</font>

1070
01:09:25,753 --> 01:09:27,883
<font color="yellow">- Are you here to eat? - Yes.</font>

1071
01:09:29,383 --> 01:09:33,213
<font color="yellow">Mom. Please don't tell me to go out and play.</font>

1072
01:09:33,883 --> 01:09:34,883
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

1073
01:09:35,683 --> 01:09:37,883
<font color="yellow">you're a very good person.</font>
