<font color="yellow">He's the one.</font>

2
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,538
<font color="yellow">After he took pictures for the yearbook,</font>

3
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,638
<font color="yellow">his father died.</font>

4
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:14,768
<font color="yellow">That's why he couldn't come to pick up the yearbook.</font>

5
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:18,008
<font color="yellow">I heard that he was sent to an orphanage.</font>

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,368
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I felt so bad for him.</font>

7
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:27,008
<font color="yellow">He was smart and kindhearted.</font>

8
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:32,038
<font color="yellow">His younger brother waited for him...</font>

9
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,508
<font color="yellow">on the playground every day.</font>

10
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:37,838
<font color="yellow">I often took him to my office and fed him some food.</font>

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,878
<font color="yellow">He was such a polite child.</font>

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:45,268
<font color="yellow">He would make a deep bow to thank me.</font>

13
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:48,908
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It was such a tragedy.</font>

14
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:51,308
<font color="yellow">How could something like that happen to them?</font>

15
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,108
<font color="yellow">I think I ought to do something about this.</font>

16
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:14,268
<font color="yellow">I can't let this be.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo! Hyun Woo!</font>

19
00:01:36,568 --> 00:01:37,868
<font color="yellow">I have to talk to you.</font>

20
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:40,938
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

21
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:42,838
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

22
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,108
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jeong Eun!</font>

23
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,968
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa.</font>

24
00:01:55,768 --> 00:01:58,608
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there? Come and help me with my luggage.</font>

25
00:02:04,038 --> 00:02:07,608
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo. I will be back shortly. Wait here.</font>

26
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:08,808
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

27
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,038
<font color="yellow">I'm coming, Jeong Hwa.</font>

28
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:21,638
<font color="yellow">Who is he, by the way?</font>

29
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:28,568
<font color="yellow">He's no one. He's a neighbor who lives across the street.</font>

30
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,508
<font color="yellow">Let's go in. Why are you back? Are you here on a trip?</font>

31
00:02:33,638 --> 00:02:35,638
<font color="yellow">This is great. Carry my luggage. Okay?</font>

32
00:02:37,838 --> 00:02:38,838
<font color="yellow">Let's go in, Ye Bin.</font>

33
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,268
<font color="yellow">Please wait there. Did you get that?</font>

34
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:01,938
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. Look who's here. - Jeong Hwa.</font>

35
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:06,768
<font color="yellow">It's my daughter.</font>

36
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:09,338
<font color="yellow">I've missed you so much, Dad.</font>

37
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:10,938
<font color="yellow">How many years has it been?</font>

38
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,508
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell us you were coming?</font>

39
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:13,568
<font color="yellow">You've been well, right?</font>

40
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,668
<font color="yellow">Of course, my dear.</font>

41
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,638
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

42
00:03:16,638 --> 00:03:19,868
<font color="yellow">Uncle and Aunt. Jeong Hwa is here.</font>

43
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,268
<font color="yellow">They've already met, rather dramatically.</font>

44
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,068
<font color="yellow">Dad, you haven't changed a bit.</font>

45
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,168
<font color="yellow">It doesn't seem you've aged.</font>

46
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,368
<font color="yellow">Stop it. I have aged.</font>

47
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:30,138
<font color="yellow">Do you know how old I've turned this year?</font>

48
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:32,938
<font color="yellow">Han Jeong Hwa. Didn't you miss your grandma?</font>

49
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,638
<font color="yellow">You've been well too. Right, Grandma?</font>

50
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:37,108
<font color="yellow">You don't have to ask me that for my sake.</font>

51
00:03:37,268 --> 00:03:39,508
<font color="yellow">Who is here? Why are you so loud?</font>

52
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:42,508
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jeong Hwa.</font>

53
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,438
<font color="yellow">Mom. You have aged so much.</font>

54
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,208
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to you?</font>

55
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,438
<font color="yellow">Are you suffering from a disease?</font>

56
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,808
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to your mom that way, you brat?</font>

57
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,268
<font color="yellow">You haven't seen your mom in years.</font>

58
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,568
<font color="yellow">How can you be so rude and ask her such a question?</font>

59
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,768
<font color="yellow">It's because her children are troubling her and making her suffer.</font>

60
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,508
<font color="yellow">What's up with you? You didn't say you were coming.</font>

61
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:05,168
<font color="yellow">How about your husband and your mother-in-law?</font>

62
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,338
<font color="yellow">You're asking too many questions even before I could sit down.</font>

63
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,238
<font color="yellow">Can you cook me a meal first?</font>

64
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,708
<font color="yellow">The meals on the plane weren't to my liking at all.</font>

65
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:17,068
<font color="yellow">Nowadays, even the meals in the first class are so horrible.</font>

66
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,568
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

67
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,938
<font color="yellow">I asked you to cook me a meal.</font>

68
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:29,308
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

69
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:35,408
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

70
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,868
<font color="yellow">Did he go inside already?</font>

71
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:40,908
<font color="yellow">How should I make him come out?</font>

72
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:42,808
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have missed that chance.</font>

73
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:48,838
<font color="yellow">Is this Ye Bin?</font>

74
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:54,168
<font color="yellow">I last saw you when you were very little. We meet again today.</font>

75
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:57,738
<font color="yellow">Ye Bin, I'm your great grandmother.</font>

76
00:04:57,838 --> 00:05:00,168
<font color="yellow">Let's say hello. Hello.</font>

77
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,308
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with her?</font>

78
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:06,708
<font color="yellow">She hasn't seen you since she was two. She feels awkward.</font>

79
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:09,808
<font color="yellow">That's not something you can say proudly.</font>

80
00:05:10,338 --> 00:05:12,608
<font color="yellow">No matter how great your life in the States is,</font>

81
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:16,638
<font color="yellow">how could you never come back for the last five years?</font>

82
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:20,808
<font color="yellow">- Am I doing nothing in the States? - What are you doing there then?</font>

83
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,238
<font color="yellow">You quit your great job as an anchor...</font>

84
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:25,808
<font color="yellow">and moved to the States right after you got married.</font>

85
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:29,468
<font color="yellow">You visited us only once after Ye Bin was born.</font>

86
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:32,268
<font color="yellow">Housewives in the States are really busy.</font>

87
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,408
<font color="yellow">Are American housewives the only busy ones?</font>

88
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:36,738
<font color="yellow">Korean housewives are much busier.</font>

89
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:40,908
<font color="yellow">At least, you don't have to prepare sumptuous feasts in memorial days...</font>

90
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,038
<font color="yellow">or make a large amount of kimchi.</font>

91
00:05:43,738 --> 00:05:47,168
<font color="yellow">You are still very mean and surly.</font>

92
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,908
<font color="yellow">You haven't changed at all.</font>

93
00:05:51,368 --> 00:05:53,738
<font color="yellow">Mom, she's eating.</font>

94
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,438
<font color="yellow">Are your parents-in-law doing well?</font>

95
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:01,108
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - What about your husband?</font>

96
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:05,208
<font color="yellow">Answer her.</font>

97
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:08,438
<font color="yellow">Is James Jeong, your husband, doing all right?</font>

98
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:12,238
<font color="yellow">We want to know if he's making a lot of money for you as a lawyer.</font>

99
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:15,008
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's doing fine.</font>

100
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:22,768
<font color="yellow">Mom, I want the meat well-done just like bacon.</font>

101
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:25,668
<font color="yellow">Okay. Just wait.</font>

102
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:42,938
<font color="yellow">It was so good to see you, so I'm calling you for the last time...</font>

103
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,338
<font color="yellow">before I leave.</font>

104
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,308
<font color="yellow">There is something I want to tell you.</font>

105
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:52,168
<font color="yellow">You have an older brother.</font>

106
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,868
<font color="yellow">You have an older brother.</font>

107
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:59,908
<font color="yellow">You have a father, but you should find your brother and be happy.</font>

108
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,208
<font color="yellow">(Ms. Kim Mi Young)</font>

109
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,308
<font color="yellow">(Ms. Kim Mi Young)</font>

110
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,538
<font color="yellow">The number you dialed is no longer available.</font>

111
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:40,368
<font color="yellow">Please check and dial again.</font>

112
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:54,068
<font color="yellow">Ye Bin is so pretty.</font>

113
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,768
<font color="yellow">She looks just like her dad.</font>

114
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,638
<font color="yellow">She slightly looks like Jeong Hwa as well.</font>

115
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:03,908
<font color="yellow">You're right. She looks different from Ah In.</font>

116
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,468
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

117
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,038
<font color="yellow">You're so adorable.</font>

118
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,438
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon, you're back. - You're home now.</font>

119
00:08:11,538 --> 00:08:13,338
<font color="yellow">- Did you have dinner? - I did.</font>

120
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:20,838
<font color="yellow">Ye Bin, this is your uncle. Say hello to him.</font>

121
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:23,838
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

122
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,938
<font color="yellow">Is Jeong Hwa here?</font>

123
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:29,668
<font color="yellow">She is. She's taking a shower. Say hello when she comes out.</font>

124
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:31,408
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

125
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,138
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ye Bin.</font>

126
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:40,738
<font color="yellow">It's been too long. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.</font>

127
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:41,908
<font color="yellow">You're grown a lot.</font>

128
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:46,908
<font color="yellow">Hello, Jeong Hwa.</font>

129
00:08:47,538 --> 00:08:50,308
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. Is James doing all right?</font>

130
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:54,308
<font color="yellow">- Do you still live here? - Sorry?</font>

131
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:59,268
<font color="yellow">How longer do you plan to live in this house?</font>

132
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,378
<font color="yellow">Don't you have to be independent from our parents?</font>

133
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:04,768
<font color="yellow">- What do you think you're saying? - Jeong Hwa!</font>

134
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:08,138
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Dad? He's lived off us for so many years.</font>

135
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,668
<font color="yellow">Now he's grown up. He should stand on his own feet.</font>

136
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,968
<font color="yellow">- How dare you? - Dad.</font>

137
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,268
<font color="yellow">Do you still like your half-son better than me?</font>

138
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,508
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

139
00:09:16,538 --> 00:09:19,768
<font color="yellow">Hey, can you stop such nonsense?</font>

140
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,738
<font color="yellow">When you were gone for five years,</font>

141
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:24,838
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon has been the nicest one to us.</font>

142
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:26,568
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm talking about.</font>

143
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:28,738
<font color="yellow">I'm saying he's too brazen.</font>

144
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,738
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa, follow me. We need to talk. Now.</font>

145
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,308
<font color="yellow">- What's the matter? - Stop it and come with me.</font>

146
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,268
<font color="yellow">- Mom, it is... - Quiet!</font>

147
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,638
<font color="yellow">Has that wench gone out of mind?</font>

148
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,108
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

149
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:51,308
<font color="yellow">- Are you crazy? What's wrong? - Was I wrong?</font>

150
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,268
<font color="yellow">- Please stop it. - You were very upset...</font>

151
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:56,408
<font color="yellow">when he first came here.</font>

152
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,268
<font color="yellow">You're too kind to him.</font>

153
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:00,838
<font color="yellow">Isn't he over 30 now?</font>

154
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:04,038
<font color="yellow">How could you live with him for more than 20 years?</font>

155
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,668
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - He's an adult now.</font>

156
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,908
<font color="yellow">Tell him to move out.</font>

157
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:11,208
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what's wrong with my family.</font>

158
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:14,668
<font color="yellow">Let's put it aside. We need to talk about you.</font>

159
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:19,668
<font color="yellow">- What about me? - Why hasn't James called once yet?</font>

160
00:10:19,738 --> 00:10:21,768
<font color="yellow">He has not just called us since you got here,</font>

161
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:24,808
<font color="yellow">but for such a long time, I haven't heard from him.</font>

162
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:26,268
<font color="yellow">Don't bother yourself about him.</font>

163
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,038
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa.</font>

164
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,308
<font color="yellow">Do you know Jeong Hwa came back to Korea?</font>

165
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:37,968
<font color="yellow">I do. She arrived at Incheon Airport at 2pm today.</font>

166
00:10:38,408 --> 00:10:41,338
<font color="yellow">Now that Hyung Seop's arrogant daughter is back,</font>

167
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,538
<font color="yellow">it has become much favorable for us.</font>

168
00:10:47,108 --> 00:10:50,268
<font color="yellow">The divorce suit between her and James Jeong, a lawyer...</font>

169
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,768
<font color="yellow">in Washington D.C. is not over yet.</font>

170
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:57,308
<font color="yellow">I was reported that she filed the suit...</font>

171
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:58,608
<font color="yellow">as James was a mama's boy.</font>

172
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:00,768
<font color="yellow">And she had intense trouble with her mother-in-law.</font>

173
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,008
<font color="yellow">The odds are she'll win.</font>

174
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:11,108
<font color="yellow">She's highly likely to get a large amount of alimony.</font>

175
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:14,308
<font color="yellow">I'm sure Hyung Seop would feel terrible.</font>

176
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:18,638
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's very painful for parents to see their daughter...</font>

177
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:21,668
<font color="yellow">getting divorced.</font>

178
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:24,838
<font color="yellow">It's nothing compared to the pain people feel when they die.</font>

179
00:11:26,438 --> 00:11:29,868
<font color="yellow">I want Hyung Seop to feel the agony of death...</font>

180
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:33,438
<font color="yellow">by making his daughter hit rock bottom.</font>

181
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:37,338
<font color="yellow">I need to figure the way out.</font>

182
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:48,938
<font color="yellow">- What about your father? - He encountered a wrongful death.</font>

183
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:53,908
<font color="yellow">That driver ended up hanging himself to death.</font>

184
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,838
<font color="yellow">That's why I lost my brother.</font>

185
00:11:56,838 --> 00:11:58,368
<font color="yellow">He had two sons.</font>

186
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,038
<font color="yellow">I was adopted. I am looking for my brother...</font>

187
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,338
<font color="yellow">whom I lost 20 years ago.</font>

188
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,338
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

189
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,338
<font color="yellow">if that's how things went...</font>

190
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,238
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

191
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:18,108
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

192
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:22,508
<font color="yellow">Mom, your daughter is back. Why are you ignoring me?</font>

193
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:24,938
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

194
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:29,008
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri, I have a cold.</font>

195
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:32,168
<font color="yellow">So I can't sing for you...</font>

196
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,838
<font color="yellow">under the window of your room.</font>

197
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:39,168
<font color="yellow">I need you to go to the place...</font>

198
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:42,338
<font color="yellow">where we had our first kiss.</font>

199
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:03,508
<font color="yellow">I still remember the scent from your lips...</font>

200
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,338
<font color="yellow">when we had the first kiss.</font>

201
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:08,238
<font color="yellow">He's a jerk.</font>

202
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,968
<font color="yellow">He's such a mean jerk.</font>

203
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:14,508
<font color="yellow">Why did he return so late?</font>

204
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:18,138
<font color="yellow">We're too old to start something.</font>

205
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,708
<font color="yellow">It's too late to start afresh.</font>

206
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:24,668
<font color="yellow">He's a scum.</font>

207
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:27,338
<font color="yellow">He's such a bad guy.</font>

208
00:14:33,908 --> 00:14:35,368
<font color="yellow">(This is the scent of your lips when we first kissed.)</font>

209
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:53,668
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dad.</font>

210
00:14:54,368 --> 00:14:56,038
<font color="yellow">Your mom is crying right now.</font>

211
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,468
<font color="yellow">You should comfort her.</font>

212
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:02,338
<font color="yellow">Did you say Mom's crying? Why would she cry?</font>

213
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:03,808
<font color="yellow">I made her cry.</font>

214
00:15:05,168 --> 00:15:06,238
<font color="yellow">That's all you need to know.</font>

215
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,508
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

216
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:11,438
<font color="yellow">please take good care of my girl.</font>

217
00:15:16,738 --> 00:15:17,808
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

218
00:15:18,338 --> 00:15:20,568
<font color="yellow">What's happening to these two these days?</font>

219
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,268
<font color="yellow">Why did he have to sing below her window?</font>

220
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:25,738
<font color="yellow">Now everyone knows about it, and I am so embarrassed.</font>

221
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:29,568
<font color="yellow">But anyway,</font>

222
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,068
<font color="yellow">they are not the problem.</font>

223
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:37,968
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

224
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,768
<font color="yellow">there's a possibility that that's what happened.</font>

225
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:45,638
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

226
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:50,268
<font color="yellow">who is the brother he found?</font>

227
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,238
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

228
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,368
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

229
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:11,968
<font color="yellow">See you around.</font>

230
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:13,368
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

231
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,968
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

232
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:20,938
<font color="yellow">I have...</font>

233
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,968
<font color="yellow">a question for you.</font>

234
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:25,468
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

235
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,808
<font color="yellow">Did you find your brother?</font>

236
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:35,168
<font color="yellow">Did you find Sang Woo?</font>

237
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,568
<font color="yellow">Did I...</font>

238
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,708
<font color="yellow">tell you my brother's name?</font>

239
00:16:43,368 --> 00:16:44,408
<font color="yellow">You did.</font>

240
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:49,368
<font color="yellow">You're just a neighbor,</font>

241
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,938
<font color="yellow">and I shouldn't have told you something like that.</font>

242
00:16:56,038 --> 00:16:57,108
<font color="yellow">I found him.</font>

243
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,008
<font color="yellow">What about him?</font>

244
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,938
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

245
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:04,538
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

246
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:07,708
<font color="yellow">Do you want to know one more thing?</font>

247
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,838
<font color="yellow">My brother is dead.</font>

248
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:17,838
<font color="yellow">It turns out he died a long time ago.</font>

249
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,808
<font color="yellow">- From what I heard... - You and Jeong Eun...</font>

250
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,468
<font color="yellow">must talk about me all the time.</font>

251
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,268
<font color="yellow">You should stop now.</font>

252
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,468
<font color="yellow">It's a tragic story for me.</font>

253
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,578
<font color="yellow">So stop it, unless it is your nasty hobby...</font>

254
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:36,468
<font color="yellow">to talk about other people's misfortunes.</font>

255
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:38,768
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee.</font>

256
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:40,508
<font color="yellow">I heard only your writer...</font>

257
00:17:40,868 --> 00:17:42,578
<font color="yellow">hasn't turned in the script.</font>

258
00:17:43,238 --> 00:17:45,268
<font color="yellow">Instead of prying into my personal life,</font>

259
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:48,268
<font color="yellow">you should perhaps focus on your work.</font>

260
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:25,138
<font color="yellow">Is it going well? Do you want to have a can of beer?</font>

261
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,208
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

262
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,638
<font color="yellow">I've finished!</font>

263
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:24,408
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you surprised me.</font>

264
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:25,868
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

265
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:27,508
<font color="yellow">When did you come?</font>

266
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,908
<font color="yellow">You surprised me. Why would you shout?</font>

267
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,038
<font color="yellow">Director Han.</font>

268
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:36,968
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

269
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,708
<font color="yellow">I'm done. I'm done writing the first two episodes...</font>

270
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,338
<font color="yellow">"Romance Learned through Books".</font>

271
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,738
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

272
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,108
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

274
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:56,808
<font color="yellow">I'm done. I'm done!</font>

275
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,708
<font color="yellow">Good job, Dong Hui. Good job.</font>

276
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:08,508
<font color="yellow">Here. It's still hot.</font>

277
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,738
<font color="yellow">Touch it.</font>

278
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,768
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to read it?</font>

279
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,238
<font color="yellow">I think I shouldn't read it.</font>

280
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:18,668
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

281
00:20:20,008 --> 00:20:21,208
<font color="yellow">I can't read it now.</font>

282
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:23,368
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

283
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,208
<font color="yellow">It's a competition.</font>

284
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:29,468
<font color="yellow">Everyone thinks I fix your script.</font>

285
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,408
<font color="yellow">I don't want people to misunderstand you.</font>

286
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:35,438
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just read it?</font>

287
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,868
<font color="yellow">I wrote it to show you.</font>

288
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:42,268
<font color="yellow">I didn't write it for other people. I wrote it to be praised...</font>

289
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:44,138
<font color="yellow">and to be acknowledged by you.</font>

290
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,268
<font color="yellow">I will praise you tomorrow.</font>

291
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,578
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

292
00:20:49,968 --> 00:20:51,708
<font color="yellow">you can beat Writer Choi tomorrow, right?</font>

293
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:54,538
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

294
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:55,968
<font color="yellow">Everything will be all right.</font>

295
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:58,738
<font color="yellow">What if it doesn't turn out well?</font>

296
00:20:58,738 --> 00:21:01,338
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It will turn out well.</font>

297
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:03,538
<font color="yellow">Even if it doesn't turn out well,</font>

298
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:04,868
<font color="yellow">I will be there for you.</font>

299
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,808
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

300
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:12,708
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

301
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:22,508
<font color="yellow">Did you write the script with your whole body?</font>

302
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:25,038
<font color="yellow">I wrote it with my fingers.</font>

303
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,578
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so shabby then?</font>

304
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,808
<font color="yellow">You do realize that only amateurs...</font>

305
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:32,868
<font color="yellow">make it obvious how hard you've worked, don't you?</font>

306
00:21:33,408 --> 00:21:36,308
<font color="yellow">Because you delayed the submission by a week,</font>

307
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,838
<font color="yellow">Writer Choi was able to finish planning for the next two episodes.</font>

00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:43,078
<font color="yellow">She still had time after that, so she went to a spa.</font>

309
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:45,768
<font color="yellow">She doesn't look shabby like someone either.</font>

310
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:47,768
<font color="yellow">But the result for the first two episodes haven't come out yet.</font>

311
00:21:47,768 --> 00:21:49,408
<font color="yellow">Why would she plan for episode 3 and 4?</font>

312
00:21:49,578 --> 00:21:51,938
<font color="yellow">That's what professionals do.</font>

313
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:56,068
<font color="yellow">What would you have done if it was already being aired?</font>

314
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:59,908
<font color="yellow">Are you going to be writing even when the shoot begins?</font>

315
00:22:00,908 --> 00:22:03,208
<font color="yellow">You know that the most important quality of a screenwriter...</font>

316
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:05,238
<font color="yellow">is to submit the script on time, right?</font>

317
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:06,668
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

318
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:09,438
<font color="yellow">I will never be late next time.</font>

319
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:13,368
<font color="yellow">We will see about that. Will there be a next time?</font>

320
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:19,238
<font color="yellow">At 4pm, we will announce which writer to work with.</font>

321
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:21,408
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

322
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,638
<font color="yellow">Let's see how well you wrote...</font>

323
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:25,768
<font color="yellow">by dragging so much time.</font>

324
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:27,468
<font color="yellow">You can leave now.</font>

325
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,938
<font color="yellow">You didn't ask Director Han for a favor, did you?</font>

326
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:35,438
<font color="yellow">What favor?</font>

327
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:39,808
<font color="yellow">You didn't pester him to read the script, did you?</font>

328
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:42,008
<font color="yellow">Director Bang.</font>

329
00:22:42,438 --> 00:22:44,108
<font color="yellow">We will know once we read the script...</font>

330
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:45,768
<font color="yellow">whether he fixed it for you or not.</font>

331
00:22:46,838 --> 00:22:47,908
<font color="yellow">You can leave now.</font>

332
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,308
<font color="yellow">You've all read Ms. Cha and Dong Hui's script, right?</font>

333
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:04,308
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

334
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:05,608
<font color="yellow">Please come inside.</font>

335
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:07,268
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

336
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,838
<font color="yellow">Are you done reading?</font>

337
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:12,838
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

338
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:16,338
<font color="yellow">Let's start the meeting.</font>

339
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:33,068
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

340
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:35,638
<font color="yellow">I came to survey the preferences for new arrival products.</font>

341
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:38,508
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so weak?</font>

342
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:41,538
<font color="yellow">It's very unlike you. Are you all right?</font>

343
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,868
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

344
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,738
<font color="yellow">How are the customers reacting to the new products?</font>

345
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,908
<font color="yellow">They love them, and we are running out of stock.</font>

346
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:50,968
<font color="yellow">A lot of customers left their numbers...</font>

347
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:53,208
<font color="yellow">and asked us to contact them when the new stock comes in.</font>

348
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:54,868
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

349
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,508
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

350
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:58,868
<font color="yellow">you look worried.</font>

351
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,468
<font color="yellow">I am okay.</font>

352
00:24:36,068 --> 00:24:38,568
<font color="yellow">Stop, Chang Soo. One moment, please.</font>

353
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:43,868
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, I listened to the recording...</font>

354
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:47,238
<font color="yellow">of your last lesson with your teacher.</font>

355
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:49,868
<font color="yellow">- That part. - Which part?</font>

356
00:24:56,738 --> 00:25:00,608
<font color="yellow">This part. This part sounds slightly flat.</font>

357
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:02,068
<font color="yellow">I see. You think so?</font>

358
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:04,508
<font color="yellow">- We should focus on that part. - Yes.</font>

359
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,068
<font color="yellow">Han Ji Hoon.</font>

360
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:08,168
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

361
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:10,968
<font color="yellow">I told you that you can't practice magic tricks.</font>

362
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:12,508
<font color="yellow">But I intend to continue.</font>

363
00:25:13,938 --> 00:25:14,938
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

364
00:25:18,408 --> 00:25:21,708
<font color="yellow">You. You! Do you think I will let you throw away your life?</font>

365
00:25:21,738 --> 00:25:23,808
<font color="yellow">If you are going to become a magician,</font>

366
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,808
<font color="yellow">I will rather have you become an opera singer too. Did you get that?</font>

367
00:25:27,868 --> 00:25:30,208
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Mother.</font>

368
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:35,138
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Please excuse me, Teacher.</font>

369
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:38,208
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, start again. Teacher, could you continue?</font>

370
00:25:50,108 --> 00:25:51,638
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

371
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:57,968
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

372
00:26:23,768 --> 00:26:24,768
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

373
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:28,938
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

374
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:33,508
<font color="yellow">I am home. Your husband is here.</font>

375
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:35,538
<font color="yellow">After being questioned...</font>

376
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:40,008
<font color="yellow">by the prosecution for three days...</font>

377
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,808
<font color="yellow">and having nine bowls of seolleongtang,</font>

378
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,808
<font color="yellow">I have finally come home.</font>

379
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:56,138
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

380
00:26:57,238 --> 00:26:58,838
<font color="yellow">My stomach feels sick.</font>

381
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:06,438
<font color="yellow">Teacher, I think we should stop the lesson here today.</font>

382
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:07,868
<font color="yellow">Please take care.</font>

383
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,838
<font color="yellow">- All right. - Teacher.</font>

384
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:19,068
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

385
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,038
<font color="yellow">- Hee Sook. - Get out.</font>

386
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,668
<font color="yellow">Get out. You'd better get out now.</font>

387
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:25,968
<font color="yellow">How dare you come back here?</font>

388
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,638
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

389
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,168
<font color="yellow">- Hee Sook. - Mother.</font>

390
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,468
<font color="yellow">- Get out. I told you to get out! - Mother.</font>

391
00:27:33,908 --> 00:27:35,868
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Move aside.</font>

392
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,508
<font color="yellow">You cheated on me. How dare you come back?</font>

393
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:42,268
<font color="yellow">I don't need you now. I will live with only Chang Soo.</font>

394
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:44,268
<font color="yellow">All I need is my son.</font>

395
00:27:44,268 --> 00:27:46,068
<font color="yellow">I don't need you at all. So get out now.</font>

396
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:47,968
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Leave.</font>

397
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:50,268
<font color="yellow">Honey, this is all my fault.</font>

398
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,938
<font color="yellow">I know what I did was wrong.</font>

399
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:55,068
<font color="yellow">- It's all my fault. - I told you to get out.</font>

400
00:27:58,738 --> 00:27:59,738
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

401
00:28:01,068 --> 00:28:02,068
<font color="yellow">Are you all right?</font>

402
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,208
<font color="yellow">Of course, I am not.</font>

403
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,568
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're crying?</font>

404
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,608
<font color="yellow">- You're crying. All right. - Honey.</font>

405
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,438
<font color="yellow">- Hee Sook. - Stop, Mother.</font>

406
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,168
<font color="yellow">Oaky. I will get out.</font>

407
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:19,938
<font color="yellow">- You'd better not cry again. - Please don't do it.</font>

408
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,708
<font color="yellow">It hurts. It really hurts.</font>

409
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,638
<font color="yellow">So Seong Hoon runs a fried chicken restaurant,</font>

410
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,568
<font color="yellow">and Seong Sik was questioned by the prosecution?</font>

411
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,208
<font color="yellow">You don't have to summarize it so bluntly.</font>

412
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:37,068
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you are being too burdensome?</font>

413
00:28:37,908 --> 00:28:41,468
<font color="yellow">- Mother, let me do it. - Leave it. I'll do it.</font>

414
00:28:41,738 --> 00:28:45,368
<font color="yellow">How can you live with your parents at your age?</font>

415
00:28:45,368 --> 00:28:47,668
<font color="yellow">- Look who's talking. How about you? - I am their daughter.</font>

416
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:51,008
<font color="yellow">Daughters can live with her parents and sons can't?</font>

417
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:52,938
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa.</font>

418
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:56,408
<font color="yellow">We are going to move out as soon as we are back on our feet.</font>

419
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,708
<font color="yellow">You're part of this too. Hye Joo.</font>

420
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:00,568
<font color="yellow">How badly did you manage your household that you had to move...</font>

421
00:29:00,568 --> 00:29:02,168
<font color="yellow">back when he was laid off?</font>

422
00:29:02,338 --> 00:29:03,468
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

423
00:29:04,238 --> 00:29:08,008
<font color="yellow">Goodness. That's exactly what Mother told me at first.</font>

424
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:12,168
<font color="yellow">Anyway, your family and Seong Sik's family...</font>

425
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:15,008
<font color="yellow">- are unbelievable. - Hey, you brat.</font>

426
00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,268
<font color="yellow">- Where did you go, Father? - Father.</font>

427
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:25,068
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon. Can you go down to the first floor?</font>

428
00:29:25,268 --> 00:29:28,138
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Seong Sik is back.</font>

429
00:29:28,138 --> 00:29:29,138
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

430
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:32,268
<font color="yellow">- When did he come back? - What did you say?</font>

431
00:29:32,908 --> 00:29:36,138
<font color="yellow">Mother. Please stay. I'm afraid you might collapse again.</font>

432
00:29:36,138 --> 00:29:39,538
<font color="yellow">What did Seong Sik say? What did he say to you?</font>

433
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:41,268
<font color="yellow">You should just stay here.</font>

434
00:29:41,268 --> 00:29:43,908
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you go down? - Okay.</font>

435
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:48,168
<font color="yellow">What a chaos.</font>

436
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,808
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Hwa. - What?</font>

437
00:29:52,608 --> 00:29:54,408
<font color="yellow">She still has a bad temper.</font>

438
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:18,768
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

439
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:22,808
<font color="yellow">Hey. Seong Sik.</font>

440
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:25,038
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing here?</font>

441
00:30:26,268 --> 00:30:27,268
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

442
00:30:32,638 --> 00:30:34,238
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook told me...</font>

443
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:37,068
<font color="yellow">not to lay a foot inside.</font>

444
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:41,408
<font color="yellow">Can you carry me inside?</font>

445
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,068
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

446
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:46,608
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik. What happened?</font>

447
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:51,008
<font color="yellow">Right. Tell us how it went.</font>

448
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:53,008
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

449
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:58,508
<font color="yellow">Everything is over.</font>

450
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,638
<font color="yellow">- What? - Now...</font>

451
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,868
<font color="yellow">everything is over.</font>

452
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:06,338
<font color="yellow">I won't be able to recover from this.</font>

453
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:09,208
<font color="yellow">My life...</font>

454
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,838
<font color="yellow">is doomed.</font>

455
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,638
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik.</font>

456
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:18,108
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik.</font>

457
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,068
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

458
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:34,208
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik.</font>

459
00:31:38,768 --> 00:31:39,768
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

460
00:31:42,738 --> 00:31:43,738
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

461
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:46,338
<font color="yellow">You use quality coffee beans.</font>

462
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,368
<font color="yellow">We do use somewhat of quality coffee beans.</font>

463
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:51,838
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you start a cafe?</font>

464
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,438
<font color="yellow">I am surprised Aunt let you go ahead with this.</font>

465
00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:59,238
<font color="yellow">I guess Aunt isn't as scary as before.</font>

466
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:01,868
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa.</font>

467
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:08,938
<font color="yellow">That's right. She said...</font>

468
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:11,008
<font color="yellow">the spirit of the driver who got...</font>

469
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,708
<font color="yellow">into a car accident came to curse our neighborhood.</font>

470
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:16,538
<font color="yellow">She said one of his sons came to take revenge on her.</font>

471
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,808
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember at all?</font>

472
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:26,868
<font color="yellow">Your cousin, Jeong Hwa was badly hurt.</font>

473
00:32:27,668 --> 00:32:28,808
<font color="yellow">Jeong Hwa.</font>

474
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:32,538
<font color="yellow">- I have a question to ask you. - What?</font>

475
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:34,608
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

476
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:37,738
<font color="yellow">You know the scar on your forehead?</font>

477
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:41,468
<font color="yellow">I heard you got it from a car accident.</font>

478
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,968
<font color="yellow">Hey. Why are you bringing up my painful past?</font>

479
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:48,338
<font color="yellow">You are clueless picking up social cues just like when you were young.</font>

480
00:32:49,108 --> 00:32:51,068
<font color="yellow">I haven't been home for ages.</font>

481
00:32:51,508 --> 00:32:53,608
<font color="yellow">You don't have anything else to say, other than to ask that question?</font>

482
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,638
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean it like that.</font>

483
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:01,808
<font color="yellow">I am just so curious.</font>

484
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,668
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the accident?</font>

485
00:33:06,168 --> 00:33:07,708
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that out of the blue?</font>

486
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:10,138
<font color="yellow">Well, it happens that...</font>

487
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:14,638
<font color="yellow">I went to see the janitor at our elementary school a few days before.</font>

488
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:17,238
<font color="yellow">He mentioned about the accident.</font>

489
00:33:17,468 --> 00:33:20,038
<font color="yellow">Goodness. How is he? Is he well?</font>

490
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:22,938
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's retiring the day after tomorrow.</font>

491
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:25,108
<font color="yellow">He did ask how you were doing.</font>

492
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:29,538
<font color="yellow">At that time, I guess a lot of kids were hurt.</font>

493
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,408
<font color="yellow">Of course. It was a huge accident.</font>

494
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:36,608
<font color="yellow">Among them, I was hurt the most.</font>

495
00:33:37,468 --> 00:33:40,268
<font color="yellow">Darn it. Did you know that because of this scar,</font>

496
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:43,008
<font color="yellow">I couldn't put my hair up during my days as an anchor?</font>

497
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:46,608
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

498
00:33:47,638 --> 00:33:50,538
<font color="yellow">Do you remember anything else? For example...</font>

499
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:54,868
<font color="yellow">Like anything about the driver? Or anything related to the accident?</font>

500
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:59,208
<font color="yellow">For instance, the driver had two sons.</font>

501
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:00,508
<font color="yellow">Do you hear yourself?</font>

502
00:34:00,768 --> 00:34:03,068
<font color="yellow">Why are you so interested in this accident all of a sudden?</font>

503
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,038
<font color="yellow">It's like a drama.</font>

504
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,338
<font color="yellow">Students from...</font>

505
00:34:07,368 --> 00:34:09,508
<font color="yellow">Seoin Elementary School got into. a car accident in 1993.</font>

506
00:34:09,508 --> 00:34:11,108
<font color="yellow">Sure, it's just like a drama.</font>

507
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,138
<font color="yellow">Hey, when I think about that driver...</font>

508
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:17,808
<font color="yellow">Goodness. He was such a pathetic man.</font>

509
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,438
<font color="yellow">- And? - That's it.</font>

510
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:24,908
<font color="yellow">As you know, I was badly hurt.</font>

511
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:28,208
<font color="yellow">Father was in such a fury.</font>

512
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,268
<font color="yellow">I am not certain,</font>

513
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:33,008
<font color="yellow">but I think they drove the driver into a corner.</font>

514
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:34,608
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

515
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,068
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

516
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,608
<font color="yellow">I heard something strange...</font>

517
00:34:39,038 --> 00:34:40,478
<font color="yellow">after I was discharged from the hospital.</font>

518
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,238
<font color="yellow">People said...</font>

519
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,708
<font color="yellow">that the driver killed himself.</font>

520
00:34:46,738 --> 00:34:49,208
<font color="yellow">There was a rumor.</font>

521
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:51,938
<font color="yellow">What? He killed himself?</font>

522
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,668
<font color="yellow">Hey, stop.</font>

523
00:34:53,908 --> 00:34:56,038
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking this?</font>

524
00:34:57,478 --> 00:35:00,068
<font color="yellow">I won't ask anymore. I'm sorry.</font>

525
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,638
<font color="yellow">So what do you think about her scenario?</font>

526
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:56,668
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid to tell you...</font>

527
00:35:57,038 --> 00:35:58,978
<font color="yellow">that I like Writer Choi's scenario better.</font>

528
00:35:59,138 --> 00:36:00,138
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

529
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:02,438
<font color="yellow">What about you?</font>

530
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,708
<font color="yellow">I agree with Director Kim.</font>

531
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:09,238
<font color="yellow">I myself isn't an expert,</font>

532
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:11,408
<font color="yellow">but Dong Hui isn't a good writer yet.</font>

533
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:15,368
<font color="yellow">I think the new secret about the birth ruined the scenario.</font>

534
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,038
<font color="yellow">It must have been tough for a novice writer...</font>

535
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,068
<font color="yellow">to change the plot in a few days.</font>

536
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:23,008
<font color="yellow">But Writer Choi made it.</font>

537
00:36:23,668 --> 00:36:24,708
<font color="yellow">That's true.</font>

538
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,608
<font color="yellow">This is the difference between novice and expert writers.</font>

539
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:29,978
<font color="yellow">What about you, Director Han?</font>

540
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:33,038
<font color="yellow">Which one do you like better? Is it Writer Choi's or Dong Hui's?</font>

541
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:38,478
<font color="yellow">I like...</font>

542
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:40,638
<font color="yellow">Writer Choi's better too.</font>

543
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:42,838
<font color="yellow">In overall,</font>

544
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,668
<font color="yellow">Writer Choi's scenario is better.</font>

545
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,138
<font color="yellow">You've made an accurate judgment.</font>

546
00:36:50,138 --> 00:36:53,668
<font color="yellow">Then I guess Writer Choi's scenario is selected unanimously.</font>

547
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:55,208
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

548
00:36:55,638 --> 00:36:58,938
<font color="yellow">For the first two episodes, Writer Choi won by landslide.</font>

549
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:03,168

<font color="yellow">Stumbling blocks must be removed.</font>

615
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,768
<font color="yellow">What matters the most is the company's profit.</font>

616
00:42:19,068 --> 00:42:22,668
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't this put Seong Joon in trouble?</font>

617
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:24,238
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

618
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:28,908
<font color="yellow">As I live across from his house,</font>

619
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:31,268
<font color="yellow">I came to know about their relationship.</font>

620
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,638
<font color="yellow">Let alone their personal feelings,</font>

621
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:37,168
<font color="yellow">they're in-laws,</font>

622
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:39,238
<font color="yellow">and she's the writer Director Han supports.</font>

623
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:41,168
<font color="yellow">That's why we should make it clear.</font>

624
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:44,908
<font color="yellow">We can't continue like this for the sake of Director Han.</font>

625
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:49,138
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep on it.</font>

626
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:50,668
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

627
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,868
<font color="yellow">Then I'll count on you and leave.</font>

628
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,068
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

629
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:21,068
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.</font>

630
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:23,008
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the beep.</font>

631
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:24,338
<font color="yellow">Come on, Dong Hui.</font>

632
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:28,608
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.</font>

633
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:30,478
<font color="yellow">Please leave a message after the beep.</font>

634
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,838
<font color="yellow">After the beep, you will be...</font>

635
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:36,908
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

636
00:43:53,938 --> 00:43:57,038
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, where have you gone?</font>

637
00:44:40,908 --> 00:44:41,908
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

638
00:45:03,308 --> 00:45:06,668
<font color="yellow">I looked all over for you without knowing that you're here.</font>

639
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:12,438
<font color="yellow">Please go back. I want to be alone.</font>

640
00:45:13,408 --> 00:45:14,968
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid I can't.</font>

641
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:19,308
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

642
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:23,738
<font color="yellow">Everything is meaningless.</font>

643
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:27,438
<font color="yellow">I'm a loser. I'm a fool.</font>

644
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:32,338
<font color="yellow">I'm an idiot who can't even develop her own synopsis.</font>

645
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:36,968
<font color="yellow">You should give up on me too.</font>

646
00:45:57,008 --> 00:46:00,938
<font color="yellow">Stop blaming yourself. Your script wasn't bad.</font>

647
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:03,838
<font color="yellow">Writer Choi's script was a little better. That's all.</font>

648
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,608
<font color="yellow">That's a possibility we've had in mind...</font>

649
00:46:07,108 --> 00:46:08,868
<font color="yellow">from the beginning.</font>

650
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:13,968
<font color="yellow">I feel...</font>

651
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:17,268
<font color="yellow">so bad.</font>

652
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,608
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for my synopsis,</font>

653
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,568
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for my script,</font>

654
00:46:24,908 --> 00:46:27,368
<font color="yellow">and I feel so bad for those who have been...</font>

655
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,938
<font color="yellow">waiting for me.</font>

656
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:41,008
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

657
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:44,238
<font color="yellow">The one who hurt the most is you, Dong Hui.</font>

658
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:48,268
<font color="yellow">I don't even deserve to be hurt.</font>

659
00:46:49,508 --> 00:46:51,908
<font color="yellow">I don't deserve to be consoled.</font>

660
00:46:55,038 --> 00:46:57,838
<font color="yellow">You're wrong. You did very well.</font>

661
00:46:58,468 --> 00:47:01,308
<font color="yellow">You were steady, brave, and confident.</font>

662
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,908
<font color="yellow">You did a great job.</font>

663
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:07,368
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm so proud of you.</font>

664
00:47:08,538 --> 00:47:10,438
<font color="yellow">You've only written a skit,</font>

665
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:13,168
<font color="yellow">but your synopsis for a mini series drama was chosen among others.</font>

666
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:16,268
<font color="yellow">You could've run away in fear,</font>

667
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:19,008
<font color="yellow">but you stayed and fought with an experienced writer.</font>

668
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:25,008
<font color="yellow">What's important is that you stayed and fought.</font>

669
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:27,838
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

670
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:29,638
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

671
00:47:30,908 --> 00:47:33,038
<font color="yellow">So stop crying, okay?</font>

672
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:41,138
<font color="yellow">I didn't even wash my face since yesterday.</font>

673
00:47:42,908 --> 00:47:44,268
<font color="yellow">That's dirty.</font>

674
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:48,668
<font color="yellow">I'm a bad writer,</font>

675
00:47:49,508 --> 00:47:51,608
<font color="yellow">and now you say I'm dirty.</font>

676
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:17,168
<font color="yellow">Why do I get more and more anxious as time goes by?</font>

677
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:21,238
<font color="yellow">I've been writing all my life dreaming of becoming a writer.</font>

678
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,138
<font color="yellow">I feel like my whole life was denied today.</font>

679
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:31,768
<font color="yellow">I was dragged down to misery with each word I wrote down.</font>

680
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,438
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was in a pit of fire.</font>

681
00:48:34,308 --> 00:48:37,138
<font color="yellow">I think I even saw the grim reaper.</font>

682
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:40,338
<font color="yellow">I felt nervous, anxious,</font>

683
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,408
<font color="yellow">and suffocated.</font>

684
00:48:43,938 --> 00:48:45,908
<font color="yellow">I really thought I was going to die.</font>

685
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:50,208
<font color="yellow">After all that, this is the result I got.</font>

686
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:52,168
<font color="yellow">So are you...</font>

687
00:48:53,508 --> 00:48:54,768
<font color="yellow">going to give up?</font>

688
00:48:57,138 --> 00:48:59,108
<font color="yellow">Are you going to give up your dream and fate...</font>

689
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:01,508
<font color="yellow">because of what happened today?</font>

690
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:04,038
<font color="yellow">Or...</font>

691
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:07,038
<font color="yellow">are you going to reflect on it and improve yourself?</font>

692
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:08,968
<font color="yellow">The latter, of course.</font>

693
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:11,168
<font color="yellow">Then what are you waiting for?</font>

694
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:17,938
<font color="yellow">I told you earlier.</font>

695
00:49:18,438 --> 00:49:19,968
<font color="yellow">I just feel bad.</font>

696
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:24,538
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for my synopsis, my script,</font>

697
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:28,668
<font color="yellow">and those who have been waiting for me.</font>

698
00:49:30,138 --> 00:49:31,168
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

699
00:49:32,738 --> 00:49:34,668
<font color="yellow">That's a long list of things you feel bad for.</font>

700
00:49:37,638 --> 00:49:38,738
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

701
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,668
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for one more person.</font>

702
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:47,168
<font color="yellow">I feel bad for you the most.</font>

703
00:49:48,538 --> 00:49:50,668
<font color="yellow">- Me? - Yes.</font>

704
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:54,838
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

705
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,338
<font color="yellow">I said I'd love you only in my writing,</font>

706
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:08,338
<font color="yellow">but I couldn't love you in my writing...</font>

707
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,708
<font color="yellow">or in the real life. That's why I feel bad.</font>

708
00:50:16,408 --> 00:50:18,908
<font color="yellow">Even after all that, I lost the fight.</font>

709
00:50:20,168 --> 00:50:21,608
<font color="yellow">I'm a fool.</font>

710
00:50:22,768 --> 00:50:23,838
<font color="yellow">An idiot.</font>

711
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:26,338
<font color="yellow">Do you regret...</font>

712
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:28,538
<font color="yellow">what you said back then?</font>

713
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:32,968
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

714
00:50:35,608 --> 00:50:37,038
<font color="yellow">I regretted it...</font>

715
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,268
<font color="yellow">a lot.</font>

716
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,208
<font color="yellow">You should...</font>

717
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:46,068
<font color="yellow">come up with a plan.</font>

718
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:51,708
<font color="yellow">You can make a fresh start with your writing and your love.</font>

719
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:56,038
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

720
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,968
<font color="yellow">- Well... - We're stuck again...</font>

721
00:51:05,208 --> 00:51:07,868
<font color="yellow">just like that day.</font>

722
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:06,008
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

723
00:52:08,838 --> 00:52:11,168
<font color="yellow">Grandma. What's wrong?</font>

724
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:13,868
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui disappeared.</font>

725
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:16,868
<font color="yellow">What? What are you talking about?</font>

726
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:19,938
<font color="yellow">I came to see if she was writing, but she isn't here.</font>

727
00:52:19,938 --> 00:52:21,308
<font color="yellow">She won't pick up her phone either.</font>

728
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:24,168
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Grandma.</font>

729
00:52:24,168 --> 00:52:26,838
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. Grandma. - Find Dong Hui.</font>

730
00:52:27,168 --> 00:52:29,738
<font color="yellow">Try to find Dong Hui!</font>

731
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:34,568
<font color="yellow">Grandma. Please pull yourself together.</font>

732
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:38,568
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. - Dong Hui.</font>

733
00:52:38,968 --> 00:52:41,038
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Okay. I got it.</font>

734
00:52:53,508 --> 00:52:54,638
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

735
00:52:55,438 --> 00:52:58,138
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui hasn't come home yet.</font>

736
00:52:59,668 --> 00:53:02,038
<font color="yellow">She's not answering her phone.</font>

737
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:06,108
<font color="yellow">I think President Bang did something.</font>

738
00:53:06,438 --> 00:53:09,608
<font color="yellow">I doubt that. He hasn't shown any movements yet.</font>

739
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:13,638
<font color="yellow">I can't just wait like this.</font>

740
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:18,838
<font color="yellow">What if something happened to my dear Dong Hui? My goodness.</font>

741
00:53:19,968 --> 00:53:21,768
<font color="yellow">I can't wait anymore.</font>

742
00:53:22,608 --> 00:53:25,768
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming over to you. - No.</font>

743
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:29,208
<font color="yellow">It will give them an excuse. You should stay where you are...</font>

744
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:20,638
<font color="yellow">Mom. What are you doing here at this hour?</font>

745
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:22,338
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

746
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,408
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

747
00:54:25,438 --> 00:54:26,738
<font color="yellow">I was just startled.</font>

748
00:54:26,908 --> 00:54:29,108
<font color="yellow">You showed up out of nowhere.</font>

749
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:32,808
<font color="yellow">This is my house.</font>

750
00:54:32,938 --> 00:54:35,108
<font color="yellow">It's natural that I show up.</font>

751
00:54:36,168 --> 00:54:37,168
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

752
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,368
<font color="yellow">what were you doing upstairs?</font>

753
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:44,008
<font color="yellow">- I could feel the cold wind, - Okay.</font>

754
00:54:44,538 --> 00:54:47,568
<font color="yellow">so I was wondering if a window was open somewhere.</font>

755
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:50,938
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

756
00:54:51,638 --> 00:54:54,608
<font color="yellow">Come. Come and sit down for a minute.</font>

757
00:54:56,408 --> 00:54:57,468
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

758
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,738
<font color="yellow">why are you here so early?</font>

759
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:02,038
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

760
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:03,868
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep.</font>

761
00:55:04,368 --> 00:55:06,738
<font color="yellow">I boiled some soy beans...</font>

762
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,508
<font color="yellow">and ground them last night.</font>

763
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,108
<font color="yellow">You used to like ground soy beans.</font>

764
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,008
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Is that why you came here with this...</font>

765
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:15,768
<font color="yellow">at this early hour?</font>

766
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:20,208
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I feel hungry already.</font>

767
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,808
<font color="yellow">Let me eat it.</font>

768
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:23,338
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

769
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:39,568
<font color="yellow">What? You're getting divorced?</font>

770
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:41,568
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Hwa. - Jeong Hwa.</font>

771
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:42,568
<font color="yellow">It just happened.</font>

772
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:45,938
<font color="yellow">We've filed for a divorce already. I'm just letting you know.</font>

773
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:47,468
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

774
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:50,838
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Ae. - Oh, my.</font>

775
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:52,108
<font color="yellow">What should we do?</font>

776
00:55:52,338 --> 00:55:54,508
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Take her inside and lay her down.</font>

777
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,308
<font color="yellow">I'm so worried about her.</font>

778
00:55:56,308 --> 00:55:59,138
<font color="yellow">She's already stressed because of Seong Sik. What should we do?</font>

779
00:55:59,138 --> 00:56:00,368
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

780
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:03,468
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. - This isn't done, Jeong Hwa. Honey.</font>

781
00:56:04,538 --> 00:56:05,568
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

782
00:56:05,568 --> 00:56:07,338
<font color="yellow">- I knew Mom would be like that. - Enough!</font>

783
00:56:07,338 --> 00:56:08,938
<font color="yellow">No parent would be okay...</font>

784
00:56:08,938 --> 00:56:10,808
<font color="yellow">when their daughter says she's getting divorced.</font>

785
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:13,568
<font color="yellow">Grandma. My husband and I have had a lot of problems.</font>

786
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,108
<font color="yellow">You still can't divorce him.</font>

787
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:17,408
<font color="yellow">Every couple has problems.</font>

788
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:18,908
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm divorcing him.</font>

789
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,638
<font color="yellow">Enough! Don't be absurd. You can't divorce him.</font>

790
00:56:21,638 --> 00:56:24,168
<font color="yellow">You can divorce him over my dead body.</font>

791
00:56:24,268 --> 00:56:25,468
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

792
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:27,368
<font color="yellow">Do I have to go through this again?</font>

793
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:29,568
<font color="yellow">After what happened to Ae Ri 30 years ago,</font>

794
00:56:29,568 --> 00:56:32,368
<font color="yellow">do I have to watch another one in my family become a single mom?</font>

795
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:55,808
<font color="yellow">- It's cold these days. - Shut it.</font>

796
00:56:57,438 --> 00:56:59,668
<font color="yellow">You should speak nicely.</font>

797
00:57:00,108 --> 00:57:03,038
<font color="yellow">You're a beautiful lady. You should speak like one.</font>

798
00:57:03,968 --> 00:57:05,008
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me here?</font>

799
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:08,538
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to have a meal together with you.</font>

800
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,138
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

801
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:26,008
<font color="yellow">Listen to me.</font>

802
00:57:28,408 --> 00:57:30,308
<font color="yellow">I came here to say this.</font>

803
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:34,338
<font color="yellow">No matter how many times you come to see me, we can't get back together.</font>

804
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:36,838
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

805
00:57:38,308 --> 00:57:40,568
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten what you did to me?</font>

806
00:57:41,568 --> 00:57:43,408
<font color="yellow">You abandoned me.</font>

807
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:44,638
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri.</font>

808
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,208
<font color="yellow">That's not what it was.</font>

809
00:57:47,938 --> 00:57:49,638
<font color="yellow">Why would I abandon you?</font>

810
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:50,668
<font color="yellow">What was it, then?</font>

811
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,108
<font color="yellow">You left me to study abroad...</font>

812
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:56,768
<font color="yellow">and came back after 30 years. You don't think it's an abandonment?</font>

813
00:57:57,268 --> 00:57:58,308
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

814
00:57:59,468 --> 00:58:02,368
<font color="yellow">really didn't know you have been raising Jeong Eun by yourself.</font>

815
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:03,708
<font color="yellow">What if you did?</font>

816
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,538
<font color="yellow">What would you have done if you knew?</font>

817
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:09,338
<font color="yellow">I would have...</font>

818
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,668
<font color="yellow">come back to take you and Jeong Eun right away.</font>

819
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:15,238
<font color="yellow">What if I hadn't had Jeong Eun? Would you have come back?</font>

820
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:17,808
<font color="yellow">I was in the boarding house in Italy...</font>

821
00:58:18,068 --> 00:58:19,168
<font color="yellow">being jealous...</font>

822
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:23,268
<font color="yellow">of the guy who would be receiving your love instead of me.</font>

823
00:58:23,468 --> 00:58:24,508
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

824
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:25,908
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

825
00:58:26,308 --> 00:58:27,538
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

826
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:31,608
<font color="yellow">I thought you would've been having a nice life...</font>

827
00:58:33,168 --> 00:58:35,108
<font color="yellow">married to some rich guy.</font>

828
00:58:38,738 --> 00:58:40,038
<font color="yellow">You know that...</font>

829
00:58:40,038 --> 00:58:43,168
<font color="yellow">I was a poor self-supporting student in Korea.</font>

830
00:58:44,308 --> 00:58:45,638
<font color="yellow">You weren't only poor.</font>

831
00:58:46,208 --> 00:58:47,908
<font color="yellow">You were pathetic too.</font>

832
00:58:49,768 --> 00:58:50,768
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

833
00:58:52,168 --> 00:58:53,768
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

834
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:58,468
<font color="yellow">your mother was opposed to our marriage so strongly.</font>

835
00:58:58,838 --> 00:59:02,108
<font color="yellow">You couldn't even convince my mom. Do you think that's love?</font>

836
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:05,268
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, I couldn't get over you for 30 years.</font>

837
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:10,638
<font color="yellow">I was lonely living by myself in Italy and Germany.</font>

838
00:59:11,168 --> 00:59:13,768
<font color="yellow">I thought about you, and I felt jealous,</font>

839
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:16,138
<font color="yellow">I was in agony, and I missed you.</font>

840
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:19,208
<font color="yellow">It is love.</font>

841
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:22,008
<font color="yellow">That's a load of rubbish.</font>

842
00:59:23,208 --> 00:59:24,238
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

843
00:59:24,238 --> 00:59:26,608
<font color="yellow">I said that's a load of rubbish. What?</font>

844
00:59:26,768 --> 00:59:28,868
<font color="yellow">- Do I have to teach you a lesson? - Gosh.</font>

845
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:31,038
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't talk to me so rudely.</font>

846
00:59:31,338 --> 00:59:34,238
<font color="yellow">Do I really need to give you a good scolding?</font>

847
00:59:36,268 --> 00:59:37,308
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

848
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:42,708
<font color="yellow">You're Mr. Ryu Myung Jin, the baritone singer, right?</font>

849
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:43,738
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

850
00:59:43,908 --> 00:59:46,768
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am. How can I help you?</font>

851
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:48,938
<font color="yellow">- It's him. - It's really him.</font>

852
00:59:49,868 --> 00:59:51,338
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with these women?</font>

853
00:59:51,868 --> 00:59:53,938
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ryu. We are...</font>

854
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,408
<font color="yellow">members of an opera club.</font>

855
00:59:56,408 --> 00:59:59,468
<font color="yellow">We all love your songs very much.</font>

856
00:59:59,468 --> 01:00:00,468
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

857
01:00:00,468 --> 01:00:02,668
<font color="yellow">Can we have your autograph, please?</font>

858
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,308
<font color="yellow">Sure. Give them to me.</font>

859
01:00:06,438 --> 01:00:09,868
<font color="yellow">Wait. Can't you see that we're eating here?</font>

860
01:00:10,768 --> 01:00:12,068
<font color="yellow">Stay quiet.</font>

861
01:00:15,368 --> 01:00:17,768
<font color="yellow">- What's your name? - It's Kim Ah Reum.</font>

862
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,208
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kim...</font>

863
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:22,538
<font color="yellow">I'm Park Mi Na.</font>

864
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:23,768
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Park Mi Na. - Yes.</font>

865
01:00:23,908 --> 01:00:25,368
<font color="yellow">I'm Shin Seon Hee.</font>

866
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:27,238
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Shin... - It's Seon Hee.</font>

867
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:28,908
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Thank you.</font>

868
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:30,908
<font color="yellow">Mr. Ryu.</font>

869
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:34,668
<font color="yellow">Could you sing for us just a little?</font>

870
01:00:34,868 --> 01:00:38,238
<font color="yellow">We only listen to your voice on CDs.</font>

871
01:00:39,508 --> 01:00:42,568
<font color="yellow">I cannot sing when there is no instrumental accompaniment.</font>

872
01:00:42,568 --> 01:00:44,008
<font color="yellow">Please, Mr. Ryu.</font>

873
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,108
<font color="yellow">Could you read this menu...</font>

874
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,708
<font color="yellow">out loud for us, then?</font>

875
01:00:50,068 --> 01:00:53,508
<font color="yellow">"Grilled dried pollack, 15 dollars".</font>

876
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:58,508
<font color="yellow">"Braised cutlassfish, 13 dollars".</font>

881
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:13,168
<font color="yellow">- It's amazing! - Splendid!</font>

882
01:01:14,368 --> 01:01:15,368
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

883
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:18,708
<font color="yellow">are you happy that you're popular among girls?</font>

884
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:22,308
<font color="yellow">Don't eat your food like that.</font>

885
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:26,238
<font color="yellow">You always ate so loudly, and you still do.</font>

886
01:01:34,638 --> 01:01:35,738
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri.</font>

887
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:38,038
<font color="yellow">Give me your hands.</font>

888
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,238
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

889
01:01:49,468 --> 01:01:50,468
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

890
01:01:52,438 --> 01:01:53,638
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

891
01:01:54,138 --> 01:01:55,338
<font color="yellow">Give me your hands.</font>

892
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,168
<font color="yellow">- Give me your left hand. - Stop.</font>

893
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:04,338
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - The other hand.</font>

894
01:02:08,568 --> 01:02:12,138
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Stop it.</font>

895
01:02:20,408 --> 01:02:21,638
<font color="yellow">It looks pretty.</font>

896
01:02:23,108 --> 01:02:26,768
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tear them into pieces after you go.</font>

897
01:02:28,608 --> 01:02:29,768
<font color="yellow">Wear them on the day.</font>

898
01:02:30,008 --> 01:02:31,008
<font color="yellow">The day of what?</font>

899
01:02:31,238 --> 01:02:33,068
<font color="yellow">The day of my concert.</font>

900
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:35,508
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun gave you a ticket, right?</font>

901
01:02:36,908 --> 01:02:39,038
<font color="yellow">All right. I'll be going now.</font>

902
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:40,968
<font color="yellow">Goodbye,</font>

903
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,508
<font color="yellow">my dear Dulcinea.</font>

904
01:02:50,138 --> 01:02:53,268
<font color="yellow">He's still as obstinate as 30 years ago.</font>

905
01:03:13,238 --> 01:03:14,238
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

906
01:03:16,538 --> 01:03:17,708
<font color="yellow">Should we?</font>

907
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:35,468
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

908
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:37,238
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

909
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,108
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui!</font>

910
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:44,708
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

911
01:03:46,938 --> 01:03:48,908
<font color="yellow">Where have you been last night?</font>

912
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,038
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

913
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:52,208
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh. Dong Hui had something at work...</font>

914
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:53,308
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

915
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,068
<font color="yellow">Get inside.</font>

916
01:03:55,268 --> 01:03:57,338
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh.</font>

917
01:03:57,508 --> 01:03:58,568
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

918
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:00,038
<font color="yellow">Get inside now!</font>

919
01:04:11,568 --> 01:04:14,468
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui had better come home soon.</font>

920
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,538
<font color="yellow">I will teach her a lesson.</font>

921
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:19,308
<font color="yellow">- Come inside! - Grandma.</font>

922
01:04:19,868 --> 01:04:20,908
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

923

924
01:04:23,738 --> 01:04:26,638
<font color="yellow">Grandma. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.</font>

925
01:04:26,768 --> 01:04:27,908
<font color="yellow">I actually...</font>

926
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,638
<font color="yellow">Grandma, what's wrong?</font>

927
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:35,308
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

928
01:04:35,368 --> 01:04:36,838
<font color="yellow">You are a bad girl.</font>

929
01:04:37,368 --> 01:04:39,868
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do this, go to your grandmother.</font>

930
01:04:41,738 --> 01:04:43,568
<font color="yellow">What? Grandma.</font>

931
01:04:43,638 --> 01:04:46,238
<font color="yellow">Go live with your grandmother!</font>

932
01:04:48,608 --> 01:04:52,408
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Where would she go?</font>

933
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:58,308
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui doesn't have another grandmother.</font>

934
01:04:58,338 --> 01:05:00,568
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

935
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,168
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Never mind.</font>

936
01:05:14,938 --> 01:05:16,738
<font color="yellow">Goodness, what's gotten into her?</font>

937
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:19,838
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

938
01:05:20,638 --> 01:05:24,208
<font color="yellow">I must've done something terrible. What should I do?</font>

939
01:05:24,568 --> 01:05:25,568
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

940
01:05:26,908 --> 01:05:31,308
<font color="yellow">What did I tell you when you slept out last time?</font>

941
01:05:31,568 --> 01:05:34,238
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you I was going to beat you badly...</font>

942
01:05:34,308 --> 01:05:36,268
<font color="yellow">if you make Grandma get worried again?</font>

943
01:05:36,908 --> 01:05:39,538
<font color="yellow">How can you sleep out again?</font>

944
01:05:39,608 --> 01:05:42,168
<font color="yellow">And how can you sleep out with Seong Joon?</font>

945
01:05:43,038 --> 01:05:45,738
<font color="yellow">- Hye Joo, that's... - Assume the push-up position.</font>

946
01:05:48,408 --> 01:05:49,408
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

947
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:01,008
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

948
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:04,738
<font color="yellow">It's been so long since I came into this house.</font>

949
01:06:05,668 --> 01:06:07,038
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

950
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,668
<font color="yellow">It looks like you are doing very well.</font>

951
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:18,638
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't crave for cucumber sandwich anymore.</font>

952
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,808
<font color="yellow">Or do you make it yourself?</font>

953
01:06:22,038 --> 01:06:23,838
<font color="yellow">It looks like you don't have anything particular to say.</font>

954

<font color="yellow">Please leave now.</font>

955

<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

956
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:32,608
<font color="yellow">I told you I had something to tell you.</font>

957
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:35,608
<font color="yellow">I'll give you five minutes.</font>

958
01:06:37,468 --> 01:06:38,868
<font color="yellow">Because we were once special.</font>

959
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:44,708

960
01:06:46,138 --> 01:06:48,468
<font color="yellow">Your brother Lee Sang Woo always waited for you in the schoolyard...</font>

961
01:06:48,468 --> 01:06:50,608
<font color="yellow">until you got dismissed.</font>

962
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:53,168
<font color="yellow">You were a good student who was kind and polite.</font>

963
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:55,438
<font color="yellow">He adored his little brother very much.</font>

964

965
01:06:59,068 --> 01:07:00,868
<font color="yellow">he and his brother were sent to an orphanage.</font>

966
01:07:01,668 --> 01:07:05,468
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo was adopted, and his little brother went missing.</font>

967
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:08,568
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

968
01:07:08,838 --> 01:07:11,138
<font color="yellow">It's a story about a man I know.</font>

969
01:07:12,368 --> 01:07:15,008
<font color="yellow">By the way, that Lee Hyun Woo guy...</font>

970
01:07:15,638 --> 01:07:17,638
<font color="yellow">moved to our town six months ago.</font>

971
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,338
<font color="yellow">And he happened to live...</font>

972
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:24,868
<font color="yellow">right across from the man who was related to his father's death.</font>

973
01:07:27,608 --> 01:07:28,908
<font color="yellow">Why did you come here?</font>

974
01:07:31,538 --> 01:07:33,008
<font color="yellow">Did you come to take revenge?</font>

975
01:07:48,638 --> 01:07:50,268
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

976
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:56,568
<font color="yellow">We've met once before.</font>

977
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:01,138
<font color="yellow">Have we?</font>

978
01:08:01,408 --> 01:08:04,108
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Anchor Han Jeong Hwa?</font>

979
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:08,968
<font color="yellow">- Do you know me? - Of course.</font>

980
01:08:09,908 --> 01:08:13,468
<font color="yellow">There was a time when every man in Korea knew you.</font>

981
01:08:14,738 --> 01:08:15,868
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

982
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,278
<font color="yellow">Hey! Wait! Let's talk more.</font>

983

<font color="yellow">Golden Street?</font>

985

<font color="yellow">Isn't that an investment banking firm on Wall Street?</font>

986
01:08:53,938 --> 01:08:55,108
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

987
01:08:55,108 --> 01:08:58,238
<font color="yellow">That driver was innocent.</font>

988
01:08:58,408 --> 01:08:59,408
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

989
01:08:59,408 --> 01:09:01,568
<font color="yellow">I'm here, Mom. It's me, Gwang Jin.</font>

990
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:04,778
<font color="yellow">- Dong Hui. - Grandma.</font>

991
01:09:05,738 --> 01:09:08,208
<font color="yellow">I am sorry, but who is he?</font>

992
01:09:08,708 --> 01:09:12,168
<font color="yellow">He's my little brother. Are you happy now?</font>
