00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:09,714
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 25)</font>

2
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:19,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

3
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, it's Jeong Eun. What should I do?</font>

4
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,184
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just go.</font>

5
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:52,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

6
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:54,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you home, Hyun Woo?</font>

7
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:02,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did he go? He's not picking up his phone, either.</font>

8
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,014
<font color=#FFFF00>(Han Jeong Eun)</font>

9
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet she repented of her wrongdoing while I was gone.</font>

10
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,744
<font color=#FFFF00>She always takes her granddaughter's side.</font>

11
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Just because I rely on her out of loneliness,</font>

12
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:27,944
<font color=#FFFF00>she mistreats me.</font>

13
00:01:29,314 --> 00:01:30,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh.</font>

14
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have lunch?</font>

15
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:37,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I had sujebi for lunch downstairs.</font>

16
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:43,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did she go?</font>

17
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:45,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

18
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Gui Boon has disappeared.</font>

19
00:01:53,874 --> 00:01:54,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me?</font>

20
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:57,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon has disappeared.</font>

21
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:59,514
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think she's disappeared.</font>

22
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:01,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure she stepped out for a moment.</font>

23
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:04,674
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? Where would she go with that injured arm? She said...</font>

24
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:07,444
<font color=#FFFF00>she won't go out due to the icy road and until her arm's healed.</font>

25
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,144
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not even answering her phone.</font>

26
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:12,914
<font color=#FFFF00>A woman keeps telling me she's unavailable to pick up the phone.</font>

27
00:02:13,344 --> 00:02:15,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Please wait a bit.</font>

28
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:19,214
<font color=#FFFF00>You just said that you didn't like her and yet,</font>

29
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:22,014
<font color=#FFFF00>you look for her when she's gone for a minute.</font>

30
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:24,514
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll see when you are my age,</font>

31
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,814
<font color=#FFFF00>the person sleeping next to me, keeping me warm is the best...</font>

32
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:30,744
<font color=#FFFF00>instead of my own children.</font>

33
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:32,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

34
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:35,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because we mentioned Dong Hui was at an age to get married?</font>

35
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:38,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Could it be that we hurt her ego talking about it?</font>

36
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:40,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Could she have run away from us?</font>

37
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,414
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think so, Mother.</font>

38
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:47,674
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? We didn't hurt her ego.</font>

39
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:51,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come in. Come in.</font>

40
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:01,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sit down. The house won't collapse.</font>

41
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:12,274
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it? Doesn't it look just the same?</font>

42
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:15,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you take a look around?</font>

43
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:24,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you bring me inside? You didn't have to.</font>

44
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, that hurts my feelings.</font>

45
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:28,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you act so distant?</font>

46
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:44,944
<font color=#FFFF00>You left as soon as I was accepted into a university.</font>

47
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,444
<font color=#FFFF00>So how long has it been?</font>

48
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,074
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been 30 years.</font>

49
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,074
<font color=#FFFF00>When you left like that,</font>

50
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:56,244
<font color=#FFFF00>didn't you miss us?</font>

51
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Why wouldn't I miss you?</font>

52
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother was very good to me.</font>

53
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:06,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, how come...</font>

54
00:04:07,644 --> 00:04:08,844
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't...</font>

55
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:11,374
<font color=#FFFF00>contact us for all those years?</font>

56
00:04:12,614 --> 00:04:14,914
<font color=#FFFF00>My son and his wife died in an accident.</font>

57
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:17,744
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I quit my job here.</font>

58
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:21,644
<font color=#FFFF00>They had two children.</font>

59
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:25,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Taking care of his children after my son had passed away,</font>

60
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,874
<font color=#FFFF00>took all of my time.</font>

61
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:32,814
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. You suffered a lot.</font>

62
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:36,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you call my mother...</font>

63
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,244
<font color=#FFFF00>to ask for help?</font>

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,714
<font color=#FFFF00>After that time, I've never...</font>

65
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,914
<font color=#FFFF00>met with the president.</font>

66
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:50,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

67
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, it is.</font>

68
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,444
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - Hey.</font>

69
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:08,584
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a guest.</font>

70
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:09,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I do.</font>

71
00:05:09,914 --> 00:05:10,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Come and say hello.</font>

72
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:13,674
<font color=#FFFF00>She's like a mother to me.</font>

73
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

74
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. Nice to meet you.</font>

75
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:24,314
<font color=#FFFF00>She will follow in my footsteps.</font>

76
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:27,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

77
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, but who is she?</font>

78
00:05:35,744 --> 00:05:36,774
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

79
00:05:36,844 --> 00:05:40,174
<font color=#FFFF00>I just heard that she used to work here before.</font>

80
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:41,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Before?</font>

81
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we met, let me ask you.</font>

82
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you come and work here again?</font>

83
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:52,844
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too old to be a cook.</font>

84
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,814
<font color=#FFFF00>My food doesn't taste the same anymore.</font>

85
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:57,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you say that?</font>

86
00:05:58,644 --> 00:06:01,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Your bean paste tastes the same.</font>

87
00:06:03,274 --> 00:06:06,274
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

88
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Your granddaughter, Oh Dong Hui.</font>

89
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:10,114
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

90
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:11,844
<font color=#FFFF00>about Dong Hui?</font>

91
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,314
<font color=#FFFF00>She works at my company.</font>

92
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,174
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't know?</font>

93
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

94
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:26,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you...</font>

95
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:28,974
<font color=#FFFF00>really never met up...</font>

96
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,174
<font color=#FFFF00>with my mom? Not even once?</font>

97
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:34,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you really...</font>

98
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:37,474
<font color=#FFFF00>never met my mom...</font>

99
00:06:38,374 --> 00:06:39,444
<font color=#FFFF00>over the last 30 years?</font>

100
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:41,274
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't met her at all?</font>

101
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,744
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I haven't.</font>

102
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:47,514
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want from me?</font>

103
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:50,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, do you know where Hyun Jung is?</font>

104
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jung?</font>

105
00:06:55,674 --> 00:06:57,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that?</font>

106
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:01,344
<font color=#FFFF00>The late Gwang Ho's daughter.</font>

107
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:05,314
<font color=#FFFF00>You know he had a daughter just like me.</font>

108
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:10,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? He had a daughter?</font>

109
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:15,114
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you didn't know about it.</font>

110
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:16,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Both you and President...</font>

111
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,744
<font color=#FFFF00>had more affection toward Gwang Ho than me.</font>

112
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,744
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? That's not true.</font>

113
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:25,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it really not true?</font>

114
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop such nonsense.</font>

115
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pretend you know nothing.</font>

116
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:39,344
<font color=#FFFF00>You and President cherished Gwang Ho only.</font>

117
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:43,544
<font color=#FFFF00>And it really saddened me.</font>

118
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:50,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really not know who Hyun Jung is?</font>

119
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:56,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't. I haven't heard of such name.</font>

120
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:20,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

121
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:24,074
<font color=#FFFF00>please take care.</font>

122
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,114
<font color=#FFFF00>I will visit you more often.</font>

123
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:35,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you get better soon.</font>

124
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:39,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Take the medicine every day. I'll send you another box later.</font>

125
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:55,514
<font color=#FFFF00>- Elizabeth. - You scared me.</font>

126
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:59,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been all day long?</font>

127
00:09:00,114 --> 00:09:01,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are those guys?</font>

128
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:04,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did they take you home?</font>

129
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have a date today?</font>

130
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't talk nonsense.</font>

131
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:12,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this medicine and go home.</font>

132
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:15,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Elizabeth!</font>

133
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:17,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Elizabeth!</font>

134
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:22,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma.</font>

135
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:25,114
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

136
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:27,744
<font color=#FFFF00>You went outside today?</font>

137
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:31,344
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the name of the company you're working for?</font>

138
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,444
<font color=#FFFF00>It's FGC. Why?</font>

139
00:09:34,684 --> 00:09:36,074
<font color=#FFFF00>FGC?</font>

140
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:38,374
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not Hwashin Group?</font>

141
00:09:39,114 --> 00:09:40,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Hwashin Group?</font>

142
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,774
<font color=#FFFF00>They changed the name more than 15 years ago.</font>

143
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:45,314
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

144
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,684
<font color=#FFFF00>It changed its name from Hwashin to FGC.</font>

145
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:55,184
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, what is this about?</font>

146
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,574
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

147
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Please tell me.</font>

148
00:10:04,944 --> 00:10:08,514
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to leave the company right away.</font>

149
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:11,644
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why? - You...</font>

150
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:16,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know that Jeong Ae is worried...</font>

151
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:19,144
<font color=#FFFF00>because you spend too much time...</font>

152
00:10:19,214 --> 00:10:20,974
<font color=#FFFF00>with Seong Joon?</font>

153
00:10:22,744 --> 00:10:23,774
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

154
00:10:23,944 --> 00:10:27,144
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've behaved yourself not to cause such worry.</font>

155
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't hold my head up because of you.</font>

156
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

157
00:10:33,414 --> 00:10:35,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Quit your job immediately.</font>

158
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:37,684
<font color=#FFFF00>- Still... - And...</font>

159
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:40,744
<font color=#FFFF00>- we will move out soon. - Sorry?</font>

160
00:10:41,444 --> 00:10:44,514
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all decided. Do not go to work from tomorrow.</font>

161
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:45,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

162
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really not going to work?</font>

163
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:57,814
<font color=#FFFF00>- No. - Dong Hui.</font>

164
00:10:58,744 --> 00:10:59,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

165
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:02,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take this.</font>

166
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:05,274
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

167
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:07,314
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a resignation letter.</font>

168
00:11:07,944 --> 00:11:08,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

169
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:12,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess this is a good thing about living in the same house.</font>

170
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:18,274
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are done talking, leave. This is my workplace from today.</font>

171
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this really necessary?</font>

172
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,644
<font color=#FFFF00>It is. I won't work for the company any longer.</font>

173
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:25,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is it because of the rumor that I helped you secretly?</font>

174
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,014
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. There's more.</font>

175
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I can no longer work with a thief who stole my scenario...</font>

176
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:33,974
<font color=#FFFF00>and the mean Eliza who trapped herself in her own imagination.</font>

177
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,114
<font color=#FFFF00>It's you who gave me the scenario for proofreading.</font>

178
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:39,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop calling me a thief.</font>

179
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,544
<font color=#FFFF00>And who's Eliza?</font>

180
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:46,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Haven't you read the classical romance novel "Candy Candy"?</font>

181
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:48,944
<font color=#FFFF00>An obnoxious girl with curly hair...</font>

182
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,674
<font color=#FFFF00>harasses Candy in the novel.</font>

183
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,214
<font color=#FFFF00>That's Eliza. She's exactly like Director Bang. Okay?</font>

184
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:59,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess Director Bang said something to you.</font>

185
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,574
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did she say? - Forget it.</font>

186
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:04,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

187
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:07,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave. I no longer work for that company.</font>

188
00:12:09,314 --> 00:12:11,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. I don't want to work...</font>

189
00:12:11,574 --> 00:12:14,714
<font color=#FFFF00>with someone who writes scenarios on the side.</font>

190
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:16,944
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say? - However,</font>

191
00:12:18,744 --> 00:12:20,144
<font color=#FFFF00>(Letter of resignation)</font>

192
00:12:20,344 --> 00:12:22,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to hand this in yourself.</font>

193
00:12:22,444 --> 00:12:25,914
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think it's something you can submit by proxy.</font>

194
00:12:42,074 --> 00:12:43,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, stay quiet.</font>

195
00:12:50,844 --> 00:12:53,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, I said be quiet.</font>

196
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Or I won't feed you today.</font>

197
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, you have a great voice.</font>

198
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:24,344
<font color=#FFFF00>But I want you to lower your phren and open your throat wider...</font>

199
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,574
<font color=#FFFF00>as I taught you.</font>

200
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:31,144
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - This part of face...</font>

201
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:32,844
<font color=#FFFF00>is called Maschera in Italian.</font>

202
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:35,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Imagine that your voice is coming from your front head...</font>

203
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:38,444
<font color=#FFFF00>instead of from your throat...</font>

204
00:13:38,814 --> 00:13:40,014
<font color=#FFFF00>and try again.</font>

205
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:42,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

206
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

207
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it Ji Hoon's mom? How are you?</font>

208
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, it's you.</font>

209
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:15,344
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

210
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I called you because of Ji Hoon.</font>

211
00:14:18,514 --> 00:14:21,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen to him?</font>

212
00:14:23,544 --> 00:14:25,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

213
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there a problem?</font>

214
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:31,214
<font color=#FFFF00>His grades dropped sharply.</font>

215
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:34,374
<font color=#FFFF00>So I thought something happened to him during the vacation.</font>

216
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Relax and make a sound from your front head.</font>

217
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:38,514
<font color=#FFFF00>How many points has it dropped?</font>

218
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:39,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's do it again.</font>

219
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

220
00:14:45,374 --> 00:14:47,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon! Ji Hoon!</font>

221
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon!</font>

222
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,314
<font color=#FFFF00>This is unbelievable.</font>

223
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:10,314
<font color=#FFFF00>What? He ranked 10th in the school?</font>

224
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:11,574
<font color=#FFFF00>10th?</font>

225
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:16,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm trying to raise Chang Soo into the best artist.</font>

226
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:19,614
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she make Ji Hoon...</font>

227
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:21,874
<font color=#FFFF00>become the 10th student?</font>

228
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:23,714
<font color=#FFFF00>This is ridiculous.</font>

229
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:25,774
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let it slide this time.</font>

230
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:37,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it here?</font>

231
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:48,414
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't Ji Hoon's handwriting.</font>

232
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:53,614
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

233
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:56,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Hye Joo do this for him?</font>

234
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:59,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. No way.</font>

235
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,644
<font color=#FFFF00>This is crazy.</font>

236
00:16:03,944 --> 00:16:05,044
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

237
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,674
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? Oh, boy. What's all this?</font>

238
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,444
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is this?</font>

239
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:41,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Ji Hoon.</font>

240
00:16:42,674 --> 00:16:44,114
<font color=#FFFF00>What's happening to you?</font>

241
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

242
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,774
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you doing?</font>

243
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's eat something delicious for dinner.</font>

244
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:03,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

245
00:17:03,874 --> 00:17:05,614
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been doing?</font>

246
00:17:06,974 --> 00:17:08,144
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

247
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:14,244
<font color=#FFFF00>You should hurry to the basement.</font>

248
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:17,474
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ah In. - Why can't you answer me?</font>

249
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:18,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

250
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:23,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In, stay with Chang Soo for a while, okay?</font>

251
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,384
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

252
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really not going to answer me?</font>

253
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:38,914
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not my mom now.</font>

254
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:43,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still think that I'm going to be hurt by that?</font>

255
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:46,174
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't affect me at all now.</font>

256
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I've decided not to care whether or not...</font>

257
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,114
<font color=#FFFF00>you are my biological son.</font>

258
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Once a Marine, always a Marine.</font>

259
00:17:53,844 --> 00:17:56,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Once a son, always a son.</font>

260
00:17:56,674 --> 00:17:59,844
<font color=#FFFF00>That will be my life motto from now on.</font>

261
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

262
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:05,844
<font color=#FFFF00>You should kneel down beside Ji Hoon, too.</font>

263
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:07,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Me?</font>

264
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:10,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Why me? What did I do?</font>

265
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:15,384
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to make him study.</font>

266
00:18:15,384 --> 00:18:17,574
<font color=#FFFF00>And you are studying for him.</font>

267
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,344
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you see that?</font>

268
00:18:21,014 --> 00:18:22,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo,</font>

269
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:24,214
<font color=#FFFF00>don't you think you've gone a little too far?</font>

270
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:28,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm working hard day and night to make Chang Soo...</font>

271
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:31,774
<font color=#FFFF00>a world-famous vocalist.</font>

272
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I even bowed 3,000 times at a Buddhist temple!</font>

273
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:36,974
<font color=#FFFF00>And you are...</font>

274
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,744
<font color=#FFFF00>studying for Ji Hoon.</font>

275
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:42,644
<font color=#FFFF00>How can it be so unfair?</font>

276
00:18:42,844 --> 00:18:45,614
<font color=#FFFF00>She did that only because I didn't want to do it.</font>

277
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:47,814
<font color=#FFFF00>So why wouldn't you study?</font>

278
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:49,274
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to study.</font>

279
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:54,244
<font color=#FFFF00>You lost your mind when your mom changed.</font>

280
00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:58,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

281
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:00,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you care?</font>

282
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to my son?</font>

283
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:03,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet!</font>

284
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:07,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Also,</font>

285
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,144
<font color=#FFFF00>that.</font>

286
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,244
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that switch?</font>

287
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't touch that.</font>

288
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:33,414
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth...</font>

289
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:35,974
<font color=#FFFF00>is...</font>

290
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:39,974
<font color=#FFFF00>happening in this basement?</font>

291
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,114
<font color=#FFFF00>His class rank dropped to the 10th.</font>

292
00:19:46,614 --> 00:19:49,884
<font color=#FFFF00>And you are studying his book.</font>

293
00:19:50,474 --> 00:19:53,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I came down to the basement after a while,</font>

294
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,444
<font color=#FFFF00>and I found that thing.</font>

295
00:19:57,314 --> 00:20:01,384
<font color=#FFFF00>So what can that be?</font>

296
00:20:02,514 --> 00:20:03,514
<font color=#FFFF00>That's...</font>

297
00:20:06,174 --> 00:20:07,884
<font color=#FFFF00>the magic device I created.</font>

298
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:09,884
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

299
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:11,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Magic?</font>

300
00:20:19,314 --> 00:20:20,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Magic?</font>

301
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:21,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes!</font>

302
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,174
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with this?</font>

303
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:26,674
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with it?</font>

304
00:20:29,174 --> 00:20:30,244
<font color=#FFFF00>I will...</font>

305
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:32,644
<font color=#FFFF00>become a magician instead of going to college.</font>

306
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:34,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop, Ji Hoon.</font>

307
00:20:36,214 --> 00:20:37,244
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

308
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:40,674
<font color=#FFFF00>A magician?</font>

309
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,814
<font color=#FFFF00>It should turn off. I think it's broken.</font>

310
00:20:58,014 --> 00:20:59,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

311
00:21:00,074 --> 00:21:01,384
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

312
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:32,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

313
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:38,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

314
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:42,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in, Dad.</font>

315
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:52,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir. Sir?</font>

316
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:55,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

317
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,614
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you thinking about?</font>

318
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:01,814
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

319
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:06,714
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance, are you regretting it?</font>

320
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:09,914
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

321
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:12,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not regretting it.</font>

322
00:22:14,244 --> 00:22:15,774
<font color=#FFFF00>It's already been decided.</font>

323
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,574
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't regret it.</font>

324
00:22:20,414 --> 00:22:22,144
<font color=#FFFF00>You are so determined,</font>

325
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,714
<font color=#FFFF00>and that worries me even more.</font>

326
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,174
<font color=#FFFF00>You left the house...</font>

327
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,474
<font color=#FFFF00>even without the final check.</font>

328
00:22:34,074 --> 00:22:35,974
<font color=#FFFF00>If it has to be broken off,</font>

329
00:22:36,914 --> 00:22:38,444
<font color=#FFFF00>it's better to break it off firmly.</font>

330
00:22:40,774 --> 00:22:42,574
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't even come forward as his brother.</font>

331
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:45,874
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hard to just look at Sang Woo...</font>

332
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:47,774
<font color=#FFFF00>when he's right in front of me.</font>

333
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,774
<font color=#FFFF00>I will stay here until I leave.</font>

334
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,274
<font color=#FFFF00>I brought the investment proposal.</font>

335
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:01,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take a look.</font>

336
00:23:06,874 --> 00:23:07,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

337
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:10,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

338
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:12,414
<font color=#FFFF00>what do you plan to do...</font>

339
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,644
<font color=#FFFF00>with Jeong Eun?</font>

340
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:46,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome.</font>

341
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:58,244
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

342
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:00,114
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? What are you doing?</font>

343
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:03,574
<font color=#FFFF00>You are bad.</font>

344
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,874
<font color=#FFFF00>You are so bad, Hyun Woo.</font>

345
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,474
<font color=#FFFF00>You are bad.</font>

346
00:24:44,314 --> 00:24:47,944
<font color=#FFFF00>About that rubbish romance dictionary you're reading...</font>

347
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:49,714
<font color=#FFFF00>What about it?</font>

348
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,974
<font color=#FFFF00>It talks about what it means when a man suddenly disappears.</font>

349
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,274
<font color=#FFFF00>It said there's a type of man who suddenly disappears...</font>

350
00:24:55,274 --> 00:24:56,514
<font color=#FFFF00>without even saying goodbye when he gets tired of you...</font>

351
00:24:56,744 --> 00:25:00,044
<font color=#FFFF00>and when he's done with his business.</font>

352
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:02,114
<font color=#FFFF00>You fit right into that type.</font>

353
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:07,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you think I disappeared?</font>

354
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:08,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you?</font>

355
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:11,744
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

356
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:14,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Something came up.</font>

357
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it related to your brother?</font>

358
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:20,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

359
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet your brother?</font>

360
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:29,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

361
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:32,844
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? Did you tell him that you're his brother?</font>

362
00:25:36,474 --> 00:25:37,574
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

363
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:40,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Was there anything else...</font>

364
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,174
<font color=#FFFF00>in the book that you wanted to do?</font>

365
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:45,914
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

366
00:25:47,874 --> 00:25:48,944
<font color=#FFFF00>We will take these.</font>

367
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,444
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

368
00:25:50,774 --> 00:25:52,914
<font color=#FFFF00>They are not engagement rings, so these will be good enough.</font>

369
00:25:55,274 --> 00:25:56,344
<font color=#FFFF00>We will take these.</font>

370
00:25:57,214 --> 00:25:58,374
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

371
00:26:19,114 --> 00:26:20,114
<font color=#FFFF00>I will put it on you.</font>

372
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:21,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

373
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:23,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay still.</font>

374
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:25,144
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't wear it alone.</font>

375
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:31,174
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks lovely on you!</font>

376
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:36,644
<font color=#FFFF00>It's beautiful.</font>

377
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:38,844
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks good on you.</font>

378
00:26:44,774 --> 00:26:47,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Time flies, doesn't it?</font>

379
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:50,114
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels like it was only yesterday that you confessed...</font>

380
00:26:50,214 --> 00:26:53,874
<font color=#FFFF00>you were David Lee of Golden Street here, doesn't it?</font>

381
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:57,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it does.</font>

382
00:27:01,414 --> 00:27:05,244
<font color=#FFFF00>A lot of things have happened between us.</font>

383
00:27:05,414 --> 00:27:06,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so?</font>

384
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:10,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Even on that day, a lot of things happened.</font>

385
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,644
<font color=#FFFF00>You got completely drunk...</font>

386
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:15,744
<font color=#FFFF00>- and slept on my sofa. - Stop it.</font>

387
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,144
<font color=#FFFF00>You said I shouldn't ask you about the past.</font>

388
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,544
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on, don't drink too much.</font>

389
00:27:27,074 --> 00:27:28,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't just sleep anywhere.</font>

390
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I won't.</font>

391
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:32,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually,</font>

392
00:27:33,414 --> 00:27:34,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to stop drinking.</font>

393
00:27:40,914 --> 00:27:41,914
<font color=#FFFF00>This is nice.</font>

394
00:27:42,814 --> 00:27:45,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Today is the last day I will drink. Starting tomorrow, I won't.</font>

395
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home even if you have a fight with your mother.</font>

396
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to your mother even though you might not want to.</font>

397
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:02,244
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all for your own good.</font>

398
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,874
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm aware of it, too.</font>

399
00:28:05,444 --> 00:28:06,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you are acting strange today.</font>

400
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:09,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you nagging me like an old grandpa?</font>

401
00:28:09,644 --> 00:28:11,814
<font color=#FFFF00>And stop getting hauled into the police station.</font>

402
00:28:12,314 --> 00:28:15,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Until when are you going to visit the lockup?</font>

403
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't follow strangers.</font>

404
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:22,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Even when I first brought you here, you got into my car without asking.</font>

405
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:26,074
<font color=#FFFF00>What if I were a bad person? What would've happened to you?</font>

406
00:28:26,544 --> 00:28:27,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

407
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,644
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? What's going on?</font>

408
00:28:35,444 --> 00:28:36,874
<font color=#FFFF00>You sound like you're going somewhere.</font>

409
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you talking like that?</font>

410
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:51,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

411
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,714
<font color=#FFFF00>going back to New York.</font>

412
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:58,514
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

413
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:00,914
<font color=#FFFF00>I've found Sang Woo.</font>

414
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:06,174
<font color=#FFFF00>I took care of businesses in Seoul, too.</font>

415
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,214
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be.</font>

416
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:11,974
<font color=#FFFF00>You should live with your brother.</font>

417
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:13,444
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother...</font>

418
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:18,614
<font color=#FFFF00>should live as he's been living so far.</font>

419
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:21,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's better for him that way.</font>

420
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,174
<font color=#FFFF00>So I should...</font>

421
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,614
<font color=#FFFF00>return to my place.</font>

422
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, what about me?</font>

423
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:36,914
<font color=#FFFF00>What about us?</font>

424
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:40,074
<font color=#FFFF00>What happens to us?</font>

425
00:29:40,714 --> 00:29:43,674
<font color=#FFFF00>What about me? Did I mean anything to you?</font>

426
00:29:44,844 --> 00:29:45,974
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest,</font>

427
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:49,414
<font color=#FFFF00>I lied to you.</font>

428
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:55,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I am still the president of Golden Street.</font>

429
00:29:57,944 --> 00:30:00,174
<font color=#FFFF00>So I can no longer stay in Korea.</font>

430
00:30:03,774 --> 00:30:06,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you already know?</font>

431
00:30:06,744 --> 00:30:08,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it matter?</font>

432
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,714
<font color=#FFFF00>It didn't matter for me if you were the president of Golden Street...</font>

433
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:14,014
<font color=#FFFF00>or a manager at a construction site from the start.</font>

434
00:30:16,974 --> 00:30:18,044
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

435
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:25,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

436
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:31,114
<font color=#FFFF00>breaking up with me...</font>

437
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:33,514
<font color=#FFFF00>today?</font>

438
00:30:37,374 --> 00:30:39,714
<font color=#FFFF00>You can just say you will be gone for a while...</font>

439
00:30:39,874 --> 00:30:42,444
<font color=#FFFF00>because you have your company and your stepparents.</font>

440
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:45,374
<font color=#FFFF00>It only makes sense that you will be gone for a while,</font>

441
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,374
<font color=#FFFF00>but...</font>

442
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,944
<font color=#FFFF00>why do you sound like you will never be back?</font>

443
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you sound like you're breaking up with me?</font>

444
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand to watch that man...</font>

445
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:02,614
<font color=#FFFF00>taking care of Sang Woo...</font>

446
00:31:04,014 --> 00:31:06,214
<font color=#FFFF00>while he drove my father to death.</font>

447
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:09,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you saying anything?</font>

448
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:12,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you acting like this?</font>

449
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:31,614
<font color=#FFFF00>When are you leaving?</font>

450
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:35,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I will leave as soon as...</font>

451
00:31:36,414 --> 00:31:37,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I finish my business here in Korea.</font>

452
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:43,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you come back?</font>

453
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,374
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Eun. - Let go of me.</font>

454
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:56,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you kidding me?</font>

455
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you playing with me?</font>

456
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:02,974
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this, then?</font>

457
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,014
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

458
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:09,944
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you leave me like this even if you were playing with me?</font>

459
00:32:10,314 --> 00:32:13,344
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand I can be loud and a handful,</font>

460
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,544
<font color=#FFFF00>but I meant everything.</font>

461
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:18,214
<font color=#FFFF00>I took you seriously.</font>

462
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:22,344
<font color=#FFFF00>- I know that. - Yet, this is how you treat me?</font>

463
00:32:23,744 --> 00:32:24,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

464
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so disappointed in you.</font>

465
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:31,074
<font color=#FFFF00>You are such a bad guy.</font>

466
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever show your face again.</font>

467
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,214
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to curse the fact that...</font>

468
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,874
<font color=#FFFF00>I liked you for the rest of my life.</font>

469
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. What's wrong?</font>

470
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,374
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

471
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

472
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

473
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:14,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I am going to hand in...</font>

474
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:16,814
<font color=#FFFF00>my resignation letter myself.</font>

475
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:25,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Oh. You're here.</font>

476
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:26,974
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

477
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:31,244
<font color=#FFFF00>You come to work later than the president now that you are a writer?</font>

478
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,414
<font color=#FFFF00>You even took a day off yesterday.</font>

479
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,444
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. You're all grown up.</font>

480
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,814
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not what you think. I had a personal issue.</font>

481
00:33:38,014 --> 00:33:41,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui. Or should I call you Writer Oh now?</font>

482
00:33:41,614 --> 00:33:43,974
<font color=#FFFF00>- It feels so weird. - Excuse me?</font>

483
00:33:44,144 --> 00:33:47,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pretend you're clueless. Tell us you're happy if you are.</font>

484
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:50,944
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. Shouldn't you switch your seat with her, Ms. Hong?</font>

485
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind me. I'm fine.</font>

486
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:57,114
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ms. Hong. The truth is... - Dong Hui, I don't know...</font>

487
00:33:57,374 --> 00:34:00,744
<font color=#FFFF00>if you got promoted to a writer in Contents Department,</font>

488
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:02,644
<font color=#FFFF00>but you didn't get promoted in our Marketing Department.</font>

489
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's clearly divide our task.</font>

490
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Assistant Dong Hui.</font>

491
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,974
<font color=#FFFF00>You're selected to help in the stockholders' meeting.</font>

492
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,674
<font color=#FFFF00>- Go and work hard. - Mr. Park.</font>

493
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:15,784
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason I cam here today is because of this.</font>

494
00:34:19,244 --> 00:34:23,314
<font color=#FFFF00>The meeting is about to start. Wasn't she supposed to go and help?</font>

495
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:24,744
<font color=#FFFF00>I was about to send her.</font>

496
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:26,784
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, why don't we start our meeting?</font>

497
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>

498
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,174
<font color=#FFFF00>I almost forgot.</font>

499
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:35,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui.</font>

500
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:39,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Submit a storyline for the concept of this season's new products.</font>

501
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:43,044
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me? - Why don't you all come in now?</font>

502
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,314
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Okay.</font>

503
00:34:45,244 --> 00:34:48,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, what are you doing? Go and help out in the meeting.</font>

504
00:35:00,284 --> 00:35:02,814
<font color=#FFFF00>(The 1st Stockholders' Meeting of 2017)</font>

505
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:14,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't we pull out our business in the contents industry?</font>

506
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:18,284
<font color=#FFFF00>Just because they got the airing time, doesn't mean it will be a hit.</font>

507
00:35:18,844 --> 00:35:20,284
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been three years.</font>

508
00:35:21,544 --> 00:35:24,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it matter of Director Han Seong Joon's competence?</font>

509
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,974
<font color=#FFFF00>How can it succeed in only three years?</font>

510
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:31,214
<font color=#FFFF00>We've already invested in the business.</font>

511
00:35:31,444 --> 00:35:33,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't we observe for two more years?</font>

512
00:35:34,284 --> 00:35:35,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think, Director Bang?</font>

513
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:40,244
<font color=#FFFF00>I think so as well. Businesses we had in China for last three years...</font>

514
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:42,814
<font color=#FFFF00>will start to show results, starting this year.</font>

515
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,514
<font color=#FFFF00>We already acquired the airing time in Korea. If we stop now,</font>

516
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:49,374
<font color=#FFFF00>we won't be able to retrieve our investments on the contrary.</font>

517
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,744
<font color=#FFFF00>It implies that we will suffer great losses.</font>

518
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:54,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me be clear. Starting the first half of this year,</font>

519
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:57,574
<font color=#FFFF00>our contents businesses will make profits.</font>

520
00:35:57,814 --> 00:36:00,244
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard your contract with Writer Jo Jeong Sook has been nullified.</font>

521
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's true.</font>

522
00:36:06,344 --> 00:36:09,174
<font color=#FFFF00>- However, - Even with her, it won't be easy.</font>

523
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:12,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you plan to increase its risk by replacing her with another writer?</font>

524
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:17,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even have a synopsis to replace hers?</font>

525
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a writer who will take her position?</font>

526
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,944
<font color=#FFFF00>We've already finished choosing a synopsis to replace hers.</font>

527
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:30,414
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to worry.</font>

528
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:34,714
<font color=#FFFF00>- We will sign the contract soon. - Is that true?</font>

529
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:37,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Will it go off without a hitch?</font>

530
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:39,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

531
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:53,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to you all, but I'm afraid...</font>

532
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:56,114
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to excuse myself to take care of an urgent matter.</font>

533
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,244
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You can go.</font>

534
00:37:03,144 --> 00:37:05,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there a problem in the contents team again?</font>

535
00:37:05,214 --> 00:37:08,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Contents team is the one causing all kinds of trouble.</font>

536
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:10,844
<font color=#FFFF00>President Bang.</font>

537
00:37:19,144 --> 00:37:22,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. I just need your signature here.</font>

538
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:23,374
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

539
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:27,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse us, Producer Kim.</font>

540
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:28,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

541
00:37:33,374 --> 00:37:35,044
<font color=#FFFF00>You even play dirty tricks now.</font>

542
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:36,444
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

543
00:37:36,514 --> 00:37:38,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I got a call from Director Park.</font>

544
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:41,044
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you send him Dong Hui's synopsis...</font>

545
00:37:41,044 --> 00:37:42,414
<font color=#FFFF00>without telling me?</font>

546
00:37:43,114 --> 00:37:45,344
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Did you say I sent him her synopsis?</font>

547
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to push ahead without my approval now?</font>

548
00:37:48,784 --> 00:37:51,214
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? You're my boss.</font>

549
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:53,874
<font color=#FFFF00>I clearly said that I would follow your orders.</font>

550
00:37:53,874 --> 00:37:57,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you send Dong Hui's synopsis to Director Park?</font>

551
00:37:58,644 --> 00:37:59,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

552
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:02,144
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you still doing here, Producer Kim?</font>

553
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

554
00:38:05,214 --> 00:38:08,284
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Park kept asking me when we would send him the synopsis,</font>

555
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,044
<font color=#FFFF00>so I...</font>

556
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:13,144
<font color=#FFFF00>I sent it to him. I thought you had already discussed it.</font>

557
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:14,214
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

558
00:38:14,444 --> 00:38:16,144
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I'm sorry.</font>

559
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:17,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry.</font>

560
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:23,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that when it hasn't even been confirmed yet?</font>

561
00:38:23,284 --> 00:38:25,044
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very sorry.</font>

562
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,044
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't...</font>

563
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:37,444
<font color=#FFFF00>leave the chairwoman as a missing person forever.</font>

564
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,644
<font color=#FFFF00>What else can we do?</font>

565
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:46,074
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't even know if she's alive or dead.</font>

566
00:38:47,414 --> 00:38:48,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to report her as a dead person?</font>

567
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,914
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't wait around forever...</font>

568
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:53,344
<font color=#FFFF00>to see what her will says.</font>

569
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

570
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,414
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying I should report...</font>

571
00:38:58,444 --> 00:38:59,574
<font color=#FFFF00>my own mother...</font>

572
00:39:00,544 --> 00:39:02,814
<font color=#FFFF00>as a dead person just to see her will?</font>

573
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:04,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

574
00:39:05,474 --> 00:39:09,044
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such coldhearted people. I can't believe you.</font>

575
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:17,244
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been 20 years,</font>

576
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:20,844
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm sure that my mother, Chairwoman Park,</font>

577
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:23,074
<font color=#FFFF00>has not died yet.</font>

578
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:25,544
<font color=#FFFF00>I have firmly believed it...</font>

579
00:39:25,744 --> 00:39:28,644
<font color=#FFFF00>ever since the day she disappeared. Okay?</font>

580
00:39:29,444 --> 00:39:30,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure...</font>

581
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:34,784
<font color=#FFFF00>my mother is still alive somewhere.</font>

582
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother!</font>

583
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:43,014
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. We've already agreed that...</font>

584
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:46,744
<font color=#FFFF00>we would wait until he is ready to do it.</font>

585
00:39:46,974 --> 00:39:48,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so,</font>

586
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:50,944
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't seem to be reluctant to report the death of...</font>

587
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:53,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Hyun Jeong, the former largest shareholder.</font>

588
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep putting off...</font>

589
00:39:55,574 --> 00:39:57,674
<font color=#FFFF00>the report of the chairwoman's death?</font>

590
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Reveal her will as soon as possible.</font>

591
00:40:02,414 --> 00:40:03,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it even true...</font>

592
00:40:03,974 --> 00:40:05,574
<font color=#FFFF00>that Bang Hyun Jeong is dead?</font>

593
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,074
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

594
00:40:11,074 --> 00:40:12,284
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us the truth!</font>

595
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Bang Hyun Jeong right now?</font>

596
00:40:20,044 --> 00:40:21,784
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, those persistent people.</font>

597
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:29,214
<font color=#FFFF00>The stockholders' meeting is over. They'll be quiet for a while.</font>

598
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,144
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

599
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:33,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you find out about the thing I asked before?</font>

600
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:35,284
<font color=#FFFF00>Like Ms. Oh said, her son and his wife died.</font>

601
00:40:35,444 --> 00:40:37,784
<font color=#FFFF00>She has been raising their children ever since.</font>

602
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:40,014
<font color=#FFFF00>How is she related to Oh Dong Hui, then?</font>

603
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:42,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is Ms. Oh's brother's granddaughter.</font>

604
00:40:43,014 --> 00:40:44,144
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

605
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:46,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Her brother was raising Dong Hui by himself, but died.</font>

606
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh took Dong Hui and started...</font>

607
00:40:49,874 --> 00:40:51,144
<font color=#FFFF00>to raise her, too.</font>

608
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

609
00:40:54,714 --> 00:40:56,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park...</font>

610
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:59,844
<font color=#FFFF00>wouldn't have left her precious granddaughter...</font>

611
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:01,644
<font color=#FFFF00>to such a lousy family.</font>

612
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:06,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Those two senile women...</font>

613
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:10,144
<font color=#FFFF00>won't stop giving us trouble.</font>

614
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,284
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the scent of herbal tonic.</font>

615
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:16,014
<font color=#FFFF00>It smells fantastic.</font>

616
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:21,044
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. She received it from some guy...</font>

617
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:22,844
<font color=#FFFF00>and tried to drink it by herself.</font>

618
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,784
<font color=#FFFF00>She is actually quite good at getting men.</font>

619
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:33,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see. Shall I drink one more pack?</font>

620
00:41:34,144 --> 00:41:35,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

621
00:41:35,344 --> 00:41:38,144
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to work as a live-in housekeeper.</font>

622
00:41:38,444 --> 00:41:40,474
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as you could provide me...</font>

623
00:41:40,474 --> 00:41:43,244
<font color=#FFFF00>a room where I can stay with my granddaughter,</font>

624
00:41:43,574 --> 00:41:46,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine with receiving less salary.</font>

625
00:41:47,444 --> 00:41:49,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I see.</font>

626
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh.</font>

627
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:55,344
<font color=#FFFF00>All right, then. Goodbye.</font>

628
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,444
<font color=#FFFF00>You always stay in this room.</font>

629
00:41:59,474 --> 00:42:03,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I was talking to someone on the phone. Don't you ever knock?</font>

630
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:06,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop having secret phone calls, then.</font>

631
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:09,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't have secret phone calls.</font>

632
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:10,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you?</font>

633
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:11,914
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

634
00:42:12,044 --> 00:42:13,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you think you're going?</font>

635
00:42:13,244 --> 00:42:16,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear me. What are you doing?</font>

636
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:17,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth.</font>

637
00:42:17,614 --> 00:42:18,714
<font color=#FFFF00>About what?</font>

638
00:42:18,714 --> 00:42:20,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that man?</font>

639
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:22,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is the man who dropped you off yesterday?</font>

640
00:42:22,474 --> 00:42:25,044
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm talking about the man with gray hair who looks...</font>

641
00:42:25,174 --> 00:42:27,444
<font color=#FFFF00>not so handsome, but rich. Who is he?</font>

642
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:30,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is the man that got you these herbal tonics?</font>

643
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,044
<font color=#FFFF00>It's none of your business.</font>

644
00:42:32,474 --> 00:42:34,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you dating that man?</font>

645
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me? What did you say?</font>

646
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:41,144
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess I hit the nail on the head.</font>

647
00:42:48,644 --> 00:42:51,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh came back home right away.</font>

648
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:54,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother is so unbelievable.</font>

649
00:42:55,014 --> 00:42:58,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Every little thing makes her worried now because she's old.</font>

650
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:01,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she be worried?</font>

651
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:04,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Her children are right here protecting her.</font>

652
00:43:04,414 --> 00:43:06,944
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not the same thing.</font>

653
00:43:07,474 --> 00:43:09,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

654
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:11,614
<font color=#FFFF00>She just picked on me because she thought...</font>

655
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:13,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh had gone missing.</font>

656
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:17,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, you should watch your words when you're living with elders.</font>

657
00:43:18,874 --> 00:43:19,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

658
00:43:20,074 --> 00:43:24,214
<font color=#FFFF00>You never know how your words might hurt their feelings.</font>

659
00:43:25,174 --> 00:43:26,784
<font color=#FFFF00>People say that...</font>

660
00:43:26,914 --> 00:43:29,014
<font color=#FFFF00>everything upsets you when you get old.</font>

661
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:31,414
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm old, too. I get upset, too.</font>

662
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:33,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm upset because Mother picks on me...</font>

663
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:35,844
<font color=#FFFF00>at every chance she gets.</font>

664
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,974
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. Stop. That's enough.</font>

665
00:43:40,474 --> 00:43:42,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Mom and Ms. Oh will be okay now.</font>

666
00:43:43,144 --> 00:43:44,314
<font color=#FFFF00>You're no help.</font>

667
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:45,944
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

668
00:43:46,174 --> 00:43:47,874
<font color=#FFFF00>A magician? Really?</font>

669
00:43:47,974 --> 00:43:49,414
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

670
00:43:51,144 --> 00:43:53,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

671
00:43:56,544 --> 00:43:57,544
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

672
00:44:01,414 --> 00:44:02,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

673
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:04,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, my dear Ah In.</font>

674
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,574
<font color=#FFFF00>- And? - Look at that.</font>

675
00:44:10,144 --> 00:44:12,314
<font color=#FFFF00>She made a big fuss before you came.</font>

676
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:19,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. I think I might do something to Hee Sook soon.</font>

677
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:20,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop me.</font>

678
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:27,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. Aunt bought me...</font>

679
00:44:27,314 --> 00:44:30,974
<font color=#FFFF00>a workbook, too. It's this one here.</font>

680
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:32,274
<font color=#FFFF00>(Chinese Characters for Children)</font>

681
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:34,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Ji Hoon?</font>

682
00:44:34,914 --> 00:44:36,674
<font color=#FFFF00>He ran outside crying.</font>

683
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,014
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

684
00:44:39,214 --> 00:44:40,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon!</font>

685
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

686
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:45,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

687
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:48,414
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do this, Seong Hoon?</font>

688
00:44:48,974 --> 00:44:50,274
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

689
00:44:50,344 --> 00:44:53,414
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you be willing to let Ji Hoon become a magician...</font>

690
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:56,074
<font color=#FFFF00>without sending him to college? How could you do this?</font>

691
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:57,774
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what he wants.</font>

692
00:44:57,774 --> 00:44:59,944
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't let kids do whatever they want.</font>

693
00:45:00,144 --> 00:45:01,314
<font color=#FFFF00>What's a parent's job?</font>

694
00:45:01,314 --> 00:45:04,214
<font color=#FFFF00>It's to guide your children, so they won't take the wrong path.</font>

695
00:45:04,214 --> 00:45:06,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, Seong Hoon and Hye Joo. Do you still...</font>

696
00:45:06,914 --> 00:45:09,314
<font color=#FFFF00>not see Ji Hoon as your own son?</font>

697
00:45:09,474 --> 00:45:10,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik.</font>

698
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:11,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik!</font>

699
00:45:11,714 --> 00:45:13,774
<font color=#FFFF00>We're working so hard to properly...</font>

700
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,614
<font color=#FFFF00>raise Chang Soo.</font>

701
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:18,574
<font color=#FFFF00>You're being lousy parents to Ji Hoon.</font>

702
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:20,274
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't have this!</font>

703
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:21,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Lousy parents?</font>

704
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:24,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you done talking?</font>

705
00:45:24,214 --> 00:45:25,214
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

706
00:45:25,814 --> 00:45:27,914
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not done talking yet.</font>

707
00:45:28,214 --> 00:45:30,074
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better go back upstairs now.</font>

708
00:45:31,474 --> 00:45:34,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to say this,</font>

709
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:36,074
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm afraid...</font>

710
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,774
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll have to raise both Chang Soo and Ji Hoon.</font>

711
00:45:39,144 --> 00:45:40,774
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me? - What?</font>

712
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:42,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think...</font>

713
00:45:42,444 --> 00:45:45,544
<font color=#FFFF00>you have what it takes to raise children at all.</font>

714
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,514
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so busy with your own business that you're not...</font>

715
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:50,244
<font color=#FFFF00>interested in their education at all.</font>

716
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook. It's not that we're not interested.</font>

717
00:45:53,674 --> 00:45:56,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Children these days are different from us.</font>

718
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:59,874
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't need to study much to go to college.</font>

719
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,344
<font color=#FFFF00>But now, kids can't even dream about going to college...</font>

720
00:46:02,374 --> 00:46:04,614
<font color=#FFFF00>without their parents' support.</font>

721
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:06,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Being the graduates...</font>

722
00:46:06,574 --> 00:46:08,874
<font color=#FFFF00>of good colleges yourselves isn't enough.</font>

723
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,944
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to do your best to educate our children,</font>

724
00:46:11,944 --> 00:46:14,144
<font color=#FFFF00>so they won't have to live...</font>

725
00:46:14,144 --> 00:46:17,044
<font color=#FFFF00>in a basement like this in the future at least.</font>

726
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Hee Sook.</font>

727
00:46:19,474 --> 00:46:21,044
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't take this anymore.</font>

728
00:46:21,674 --> 00:46:24,444
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. We live in a basement. What are you going to do about it?</font>

729
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:28,544
<font color=#FFFF00>It's even a basement in my parents-in-law's house. So what?</font>

730
00:46:28,644 --> 00:46:32,044
<font color=#FFFF00>We're still not the parents our children are ashamed of.</font>

731
00:46:32,244 --> 00:46:34,714
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't do bad things, embezzle money,</font>

732
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:38,944
<font color=#FFFF00>or prey on the weak to get our children better things.</font>

733
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:40,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that enough?</font>

734
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:41,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Ask children...</font>

735
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:43,644
<font color=#FFFF00>if they want kind and righteous parents...</font>

736
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:46,414
<font color=#FFFF00>or wealthy parents who can fully support them.</font>

737
00:46:46,714 --> 00:46:48,614
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Children don't want...</font>

738
00:46:48,814 --> 00:46:52,574
<font color=#FFFF00>to lead the same life as their parents.</font>

739
00:46:52,574 --> 00:46:55,014
<font color=#FFFF00>They want a better life.</font>

740
00:46:55,144 --> 00:46:57,174
<font color=#FFFF00>They want more decent life than that of parents.</font>

741
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:00,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, education is the only solution...</font>

742
00:47:00,914 --> 00:47:02,314
<font color=#FFFF00>in this country.</font>

743
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:03,944
<font color=#FFFF00>We should make...</font>

744
00:47:04,014 --> 00:47:07,314
<font color=#FFFF00>our kids go to better college than other kids.</font>

745
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:11,244
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right. That's how we raise our kid.</font>

746
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:16,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I can no longer stand...</font>

747
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:18,474
<font color=#FFFF00>this situation.</font>

748
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:21,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take care of the education of the children from now.</font>

749
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:23,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to work and make money.</font>

750
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:25,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

751
00:47:28,874 --> 00:47:31,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me take care of Chang Soo and Ji Hoon.</font>

752
00:47:34,414 --> 00:47:35,944
<font color=#FFFF00>And I want Ah In as well.</font>

753
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,874
<font color=#FFFF00>She plays too much.</font>

754
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:41,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, Dad!</font>

755
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:46,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In, did you study Chinese letters...</font>

756
00:47:46,674 --> 00:47:48,444
<font color=#FFFF00>with the book...</font>

757
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,344
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought for you?</font>

758
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:59,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I have to give some scolding to you?</font>

759
00:48:02,944 --> 00:48:04,444
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's okay. - It's all right.</font>

760
00:48:08,274 --> 00:48:09,514
<font color=#FFFF00>I failed to submit the resignation letter in the end.</font>

761
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:12,544
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'll make sure to hand it in tomorrow.</font>

762
00:48:17,574 --> 00:48:19,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to leave the company that badly?</font>

763
00:48:20,414 --> 00:48:21,674
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you get here?</font>

764
00:48:22,744 --> 00:48:24,074
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got here.</font>

765
00:48:25,314 --> 00:48:27,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I was watching you...</font>

766
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:30,714
<font color=#FFFF00>staring at the letter pathetically.</font>

767
00:48:31,514 --> 00:48:33,644
<font color=#FFFF00>- Director. - I'll get straight to the point.</font>

768
00:48:33,774 --> 00:48:35,314
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't take long.</font>

769
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,074
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it you really want to do?</font>

770
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:42,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Number one.</font>

771
00:48:43,214 --> 00:48:46,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Working like a slave in the FGC Content Marketing team...</font>

772
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:49,014
<font color=#FFFF00>for 16 years and 8 months.</font>

773
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, three months have passed.</font>

774
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:53,514
<font color=#FFFF00>So it's 16 years and 5 months.</font>

775
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:59,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Number two. Working as an assistant in the FGC Content Marketing team...</font>

776
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:04,014
<font color=#FFFF00>and dream of becoming a writer someday...</font>

777
00:49:04,014 --> 00:49:05,214
<font color=#FFFF00>only to grow old.</font>

778
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,044
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Number three.</font>

779
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:10,014
<font color=#FFFF00>After quitting FGC Group,</font>

780
00:49:10,974 --> 00:49:14,244
<font color=#FFFF00>you spend the rest of your life with 200,000 dollars of debt...</font>

781
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:16,044
<font color=#FFFF00>as an incompetent writer...</font>

782
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,874
<font color=#FFFF00>who lacks endurance.</font>

783
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:20,974
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me. - Number four.</font>

784
00:49:21,014 --> 00:49:24,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Working hard as an official writer of the FGC Content Marketing team...</font>

785
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:27,644
<font color=#FFFF00>and becoming a renowned writer with your efforts.</font>

786
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:32,574
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is this for? - I am serious.</font>

787
00:49:32,814 --> 00:49:34,314
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to face the reality.</font>

788
00:49:34,674 --> 00:49:37,614
<font color=#FFFF00>It has just begun,</font>

789
00:49:38,114 --> 00:49:39,614
<font color=#FFFF00>and you've got a long way to go.</font>

790
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:45,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Your scenario ended up...</font>

791
00:49:45,614 --> 00:49:48,044
<font color=#FFFF00>in a broadcasting station before I knew it.</font>

792
00:49:48,174 --> 00:49:50,544
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - They found it very interesting.</font>

793
00:49:50,844 --> 00:49:52,114
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only one...</font>

794
00:49:52,314 --> 00:49:55,474
<font color=#FFFF00>who doesn't recognize the value of your scenario.</font>

795
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:58,114
<font color=#FFFF00>How did it...</font>

796
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:02,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sleep on it and make the right choice for yourself.</font>

797
00:50:03,074 --> 00:50:06,074
<font color=#FFFF00>You can submit your resignation letter whenever you want,</font>

798
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,414
<font color=#FFFF00>but such opportunity would be rare.</font>

799
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,044
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll choose to face the reality...</font>

800
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,744
<font color=#FFFF00>or to run away only to keep your pride.</font>

801
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:16,674
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all up to you.</font>

802
00:50:18,374 --> 00:50:19,374
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll leave, then.</font>

803
00:50:24,274 --> 00:50:25,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

804
00:50:27,314 --> 00:50:29,714
<font color=#FFFF00>I also read "Candy Candy".</font>

805
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:34,774
<font color=#FFFF00>But I like neither Candy nor Eliza.</font>

806
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:37,774
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - Both of them aren't my type.</font>

807
00:50:40,114 --> 00:50:42,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... Wait.</font>

808
00:51:04,014 --> 00:51:05,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Did your parents die?</font>

809
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:08,674
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you cry in your bed for such a long time?</font>

810
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:12,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, please leave me alone.</font>

811
00:51:12,514 --> 00:51:14,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave!</font>

812
00:51:15,044 --> 00:51:17,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying for such things like I did when I was young?</font>

813
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:21,044
<font color=#FFFF00>Let him go if he wants to. And do not wait for him.</font>

814
00:51:21,214 --> 00:51:25,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Because men who walk away never come back.</font>

815
00:51:27,544 --> 00:51:30,044
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're crying like this when I get home from work,</font>

816
00:51:30,044 --> 00:51:32,514
<font color=#FFFF00>you will be as good as dead. Okay?</font>

817
00:52:05,474 --> 00:52:08,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Do it again. Lower your phren and open up your throat.</font>

818
00:52:09,174 --> 00:52:10,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's start over.</font>

819
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:17,574
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

820
00:52:19,214 --> 00:52:22,844
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm exhausted. - Come on. Tighten your stomach. Go.</font>

821
00:53:09,544 --> 00:53:12,644
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do kids always break their parents' hearts?</font>

822
00:53:20,014 --> 00:53:21,114
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

823
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:25,414
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. This can't be him.</font>

824
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:28,574
<font color=#FFFF00>That arrogant and cantankerous guy...</font>

825
00:53:28,574 --> 00:53:30,644
<font color=#FFFF00>will never sing Korean songs.</font>

826
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:34,074
<font color=#FFFF00>He's such a sassy jerk who sings arias only.</font>

827
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:01,374
<font color=#FFFF00>If he turns up in front of me,</font>

828
00:54:01,614 --> 00:54:03,214
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll rip him to pieces.</font>

829
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:18,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm hearing things now because I'm so stressed out...</font>

830
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:20,944
<font color=#FFFF00>about Jeong Eun.</font>

831
00:54:21,644 --> 00:54:23,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's calm down.</font>

832
00:54:37,114 --> 00:54:39,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, that was fantastic.</font>

833
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:42,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you still have such a great voice.</font>

834
00:54:42,244 --> 00:54:44,344
<font color=#FFFF00>My voice isn't as young as before.</font>

835
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say that. You're the world-renowned baritone.</font>

836
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:49,244
<font color=#FFFF00>The world-renowned baritone?</font>

837
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:53,474
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, do you plan to live in Korea?</font>

838
00:54:54,414 --> 00:54:56,974
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't decided yet, but I think I will.</font>

839
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,814
<font color=#FFFF00>I traveled around the world...</font>

840
00:55:00,574 --> 00:55:02,444
<font color=#FFFF00>and sang too many foreign songs.</font>

841
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I want to sing...</font>

842
00:55:04,314 --> 00:55:06,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Korean folk songs with Korean lyrics.</font>

843
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:11,774
<font color=#FFFF00>It's also about time that I repaid what I owe to my country.</font>

844
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:14,114
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

845
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:16,874
<font color=#FFFF00>I will release a cross-over album soon.</font>

846
00:55:16,944 --> 00:55:19,744
<font color=#FFFF00>That's one of the reason of my return.</font>

847
00:55:19,744 --> 00:55:21,714
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so happy for you.</font>

848
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,344
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't met for too long, right?</font>

849
00:55:26,144 --> 00:55:27,244
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

850
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:29,774
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's been about 30 years. - I know.</font>

851
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember that you, I, and Ae Ri...</font>

852
00:55:33,114 --> 00:55:35,474
<font color=#FFFF00>spent a lot of time together when we were in college?</font>

853
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:40,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I am sorry.</font>

854
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:46,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor Son,</font>

855
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,574
<font color=#FFFF00>- has Ae Ri been well? - Yes.</font>

856
00:55:59,974 --> 00:56:02,544
<font color=#FFFF00>(Professor Han Ae Ri)</font>

857
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:17,274
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they really make these for human?</font>

858
00:56:21,574 --> 00:56:24,114
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever. Let me wipe my hands.</font>

859
00:56:33,714 --> 00:56:36,574
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am, can I have ramyeon? - Yes.</font>

860
00:56:36,614 --> 00:56:39,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Please add an egg. Please cook it nicely.</font>

861
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:40,974
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

862
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:49,374
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so delicious.</font>

863
00:56:50,014 --> 00:56:51,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

864
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:08,614
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I didn't know cabbage was so delicious.</font>

865
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:12,014
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so glad I came here to eat.</font>

866
00:57:20,944 --> 00:57:22,114
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so good.</font>

867
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:41,444
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so good.</font>

868
00:57:44,144 --> 00:57:45,214
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri!</font>

869
00:57:58,014 --> 00:57:59,074
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are they?</font>

870
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,844
<font color=#FFFF00>They're from a global investment company.</font>

871
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:03,714
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the best one in the industry. It has great financial status...</font>

872
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:05,274
<font color=#FFFF00>and credibility.</font>

873
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:07,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would they...</font>

874
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:09,374
<font color=#FFFF00>want to make investments in our team, then?</font>

875
00:58:09,774 --> 00:58:12,144
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't decided which show we're going to produce,</font>

876
00:58:12,274 --> 00:58:13,874
<font color=#FFFF00>and everything is still uncertain.</font>

877
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:17,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do they want to invest such a large sum of money in us?</font>

878
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:18,874
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand.</font>

879
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:20,574
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the reason.</font>

880
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:23,114
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - They're investing...</font>

881
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,114
<font color=#FFFF00>their money in you, Seong Joon.</font>

882
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:31,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

883
00:58:44,714 --> 00:58:46,214
<font color=#FFFF00>There he is. That's Director Han.</font>

884
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:52,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

885
00:59:04,614 --> 00:59:05,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

886
00:59:06,214 --> 00:59:08,844
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Han Seong Joon, the director of Contents Marketing team.</font>

887
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:12,714
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Director Han. You should introduce yourself more properly.</font>

888
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:16,614
<font color=#FFFF00>He is David Lee, the president of the global investment company,</font>

889
00:59:17,514 --> 00:59:19,014
<font color=#FFFF00>Golden Street.</font>

890
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:25,344
<font color=#FFFF00>Nice to meet you.</font>

891
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:35,114
<font color=#FFFF00>You've made a wonderful decision.</font>

892
00:59:35,374 --> 00:59:39,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Contents business will be the most profitable business in the future.</font>

893
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:41,674
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

894
00:59:41,974 --> 00:59:44,044
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why my company is making this investment.</font>

895
00:59:44,114 --> 00:59:47,474
<font color=#FFFF00>I suppose you've already learned it through your analysis,</font>

896
00:59:47,644 --> 00:59:48,874
<font color=#FFFF00>but Director Han is...</font>

897
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,514
<font color=#FFFF00>one of the most recognized producer in the industry.</font>

898
00:59:53,074 --> 00:59:54,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I already know.</font>

899
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:58,414
<font color=#FFFF00>I also know that you've been having difficulties...</font>

900
00:59:58,414 --> 01:00:00,374
<font color=#FFFF00>producing a new drama series.</font>

901
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,974
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. That's right.</font>

902
01:00:04,374 --> 01:00:05,974
<font color=#FFFF00>By investment, do you mean...</font>

903
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:08,374
<font color=#FFFF00>you want to invest in our new drama series?</font>

904
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,314
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

905
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:12,744
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to invest in the drama series...</font>

906
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:15,044
<font color=#FFFF00>you're planning to produce.</font>

907
01:00:18,344 --> 01:00:20,674
<font color=#FFFF00>The writer we hired was signed with another company,</font>

908
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:22,544
<font color=#FFFF00>so our contract has been nullified.</font>

909
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,274
<font color=#FFFF00>That means...</font>

910
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:26,874
<font color=#FFFF00>we haven't selected a writer,</font>

911
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:29,044
<font color=#FFFF00>or a scenario yet.</font>

912
01:00:29,374 --> 01:00:30,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

913
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:32,644
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm aware of that, too.</font>

914
01:00:32,914 --> 01:00:34,474
<font color=#FFFF00>May I ask...</font>

915
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:38,874
<font color=#FFFF00>why you want to make an investment despite all that?</font>

916
01:00:39,614 --> 01:00:40,674
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

917
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:50,944
<font color=#FFFF00>I've watched you for a long time. I trust my instinct...</font>

918
01:00:52,674 --> 01:00:54,714
<font color=#FFFF00>and your ability.</font>

919
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:56,444
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me?</font>

920
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:00,844
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my principle.</font>

921
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,574
<font color=#FFFF00>70 percent of my decision is based on data,</font>

922
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:07,644
<font color=#FFFF00>and the other 30 percent...</font>

923
01:01:08,074 --> 01:01:09,644
<font color=#FFFF00>is based on my instinct.</font>

924
01:01:16,114 --> 01:01:17,414
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

925
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:19,744
<font color=#FFFF00>No wonder you're a president of a global company.</font>

926
01:01:20,014 --> 01:01:21,614
<font color=#FFFF00>You're very magnanimous.</font>

927
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:27,714
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you must've looked into our company already,</font>

928
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:30,144
<font color=#FFFF00>so I won't explain further.</font>

929
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:33,814
<font color=#FFFF00>Our branch in Korea will handle the contract...</font>

930
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:35,444
<font color=#FFFF00>and other details.</font>

931
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:36,574
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

932
01:01:36,574 --> 01:01:38,714
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should get going now.</font>

933
01:01:38,714 --> 01:01:40,514
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Sure.</font>

934
01:01:41,174 --> 01:01:42,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

935
01:01:45,474 --> 01:01:48,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be at the head office overseeing the process.</font>

936
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:49,874
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

937
01:02:12,244 --> 01:02:13,474
<font color=#FFFF00>Golden Street...</font>

938
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:16,714
<font color=#FFFF00>believes in your ability, Director Han.</font>

939
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:20,744
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why we decided to make an investment.</font>

940
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:23,444
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope...</font>

941
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,914
<font color=#FFFF00>your new drama series will be a success.</font>

942
01:04:42,674 --> 01:04:43,744
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

943
01:04:50,274 --> 01:04:51,544
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

944
01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:53,274
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

945
01:04:53,774 --> 01:04:55,844
<font color=#FFFF00>I found it out when I was reviewing the documents.</font>

946
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,074
<font color=#FFFF00>We had two boys here that day.</font>

947
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:00,574
<font color=#FFFF00>They were around the same age.</font>

948
01:05:01,174 --> 01:05:02,274
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

949
01:05:02,414 --> 01:05:05,414
<font color=#FFFF00>The report says that both of them didn't know their names or ages.</font>

950
01:05:06,244 --> 01:05:08,374
<font color=#FFFF00>They both stayed here for two days,</font>

951
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:10,944
<font color=#FFFF00>and they were sent to that orphanage.</font>

952
01:05:12,344 --> 01:05:14,644
<font color=#FFFF00>One of them ran away from the orphanage.</font>

953
01:05:15,514 --> 01:05:17,244
<font color=#FFFF00>May I see his picture again?</font>

954
01:05:33,774 --> 01:05:34,774
<font color=#FFFF00>This boy...</font>

955
01:05:37,274 --> 01:05:38,314
<font color=#FFFF00>died.</font>

956
01:05:42,644 --> 01:05:45,874
<font color=#FFFF00>These are pictures of the articles he left behind...</font>

957
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:48,074
<font color=#FFFF00>after the accident.</font>

958
01:06:21,814 --> 01:06:23,714
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks exactly the same.</font>

959
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:37,774
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Hyung Seop.</font>

960
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:39,714
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's nice to see you. - What are you doing?</font>

961
01:06:39,944 --> 01:06:41,374
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come here?</font>

962
01:06:41,674 --> 01:06:44,214
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Why can't I come here?</font>

963
01:06:47,714 --> 01:06:50,144
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Seong Joon well?</font>

964
01:07:13,274 --> 01:07:15,274
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

965
01:07:15,904 --> 01:07:17,204
<font color=#FFFF00>You are Seong Joon.</font>

966
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:19,614
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't recognize you.</font>

967
01:07:20,144 --> 01:07:21,514
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know who I am?</font>

968
01:07:21,714 --> 01:07:23,914
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be afraid. I'm here for you.</font>

969
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:28,174
<font color=#FFFF00>Is madam even alive?</font>

970
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,844
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is the woman you met...</font>

971
01:07:32,244 --> 01:07:33,274
<font color=#FFFF00>in the afternoon?</font>

972
01:07:33,974 --> 01:07:37,544
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it have to be Dong Hui? Can't you give up?</font>

973
01:07:38,414 --> 01:07:39,944
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir? Sir!</font>
