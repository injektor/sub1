1
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:08,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Lee Hyun Woo who lives across the street...</font>

2
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:13,972
<font color=#FFFF00>is my real brother.</font>

3
00:00:14,772 --> 00:00:15,802
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

4
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:24,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

5
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:28,632
<font color=#FFFF00>the son of the driver who committed suicide.</font>

6
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Lee Sang Woo.</font>

7
00:00:35,172 --> 00:00:36,332
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

8
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:01,272
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 41)</font>

9
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:14,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Now everything makes sense.</font>

10
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

11
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:21,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to say.</font>

12
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:23,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop,</font>

13
00:01:24,672 --> 00:01:26,332
<font color=#FFFF00>don't you have a mother?</font>

14
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have a wife? Why did you do that?</font>

15
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:33,832
<font color=#FFFF00>You could've discussed it with us.</font>

16
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,402
<font color=#FFFF00>If Seong Joon didn't tell us,</font>

17
00:01:36,532 --> 00:01:40,402
<font color=#FFFF00>were you going to carry the burden alone for the rest of your life?</font>

18
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:43,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

19
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:45,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Even now,</font>

20
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:50,532
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should've carried the burden alone.</font>

21
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:52,332
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

22
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Ae.</font>

23
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:57,272
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you lie to me like this?</font>

24
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,872
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you make me raise the son of...</font>

25
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:01,402
<font color=#FFFF00>that driver?</font>

26
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:03,532
<font color=#FFFF00>And you tore my heart by...</font>

27
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,072
<font color=#FFFF00>lying that you had an affair.</font>

28
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,332
<font color=#FFFF00>If I told you the truth,</font>

29
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,972
<font color=#FFFF00>would you have raised Seong Joon?</font>

30
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:14,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I certainly wouldn't have. Why would I raise him?</font>

31
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,802
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did I kill the bus driver? - Even if that's the case,</font>

32
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>this is no way to treat your wife with whom you lived all your life.</font>

33
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

34
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:26,172
<font color=#FFFF00>it's Jeong Ae who raised Seong Joon.</font>

35
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>It took years for her to accept him as her son.</font>

36
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:35,242
<font color=#FFFF00>At the end, she raised him well.</font>

37
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you should have at least...</font>

38
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,302
<font color=#FFFF00>told her...</font>

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,002
<font color=#FFFF00>who she is raising...</font>

40
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,872
<font color=#FFFF00>and from where you brought him.</font>

41
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,002
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what marriage is.</font>

42
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:48,732
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

43
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:54,232
<font color=#FFFF00>I was worried if I told her, Seong Joon wouldn't grow up well.</font>

44
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

45
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hear what he just said?</font>

46
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:03,072
<font color=#FFFF00>A poor man ended his life after all.</font>

47
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:05,302
<font color=#FFFF00>He left his children behind.</font>

48
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't turn my eyes away from them.</font>

49
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,432
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have brought both of them and raised them.</font>

50
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,172
<font color=#FFFF00>If you did, this disaster wouldn't have happened now.</font>

51
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,632
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to do that too.</font>

52
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:19,972
<font color=#FFFF00>When I went to get him, he was already adopted and left Korea.</font>

53
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:21,472
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

54
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

55
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:26,202
<font color=#FFFF00>This is unbelievable.</font>

56
00:03:27,402 --> 00:03:29,432
<font color=#FFFF00>What I have committed is quite grave, Mom.</font>

57
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:33,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Back then,</font>

58
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:36,432
<font color=#FFFF00>I only cared about my children.</font>

59
00:03:37,832 --> 00:03:39,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

60
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,902
<font color=#FFFF00>you must have gone through a very difficult time all these years.</font>

61
00:03:45,102 --> 00:03:46,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

62
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:48,602
<font color=#FFFF00>What about preposterous feelings I have?</font>

63
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I just found out that I have been raising...</font>

64
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:54,432
<font color=#FFFF00>the son of the bus driver who committed suicide for 23 years.</font>

65
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:58,402
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't ever understand you.</font>

66
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't forgive you.</font>

67
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

68
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:09,902
<font color=#FFFF00>How will we resolve this problem now?</font>

69
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:17,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do it?</font>

70
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:18,872
<font color=#FFFF00>If I don't,</font>

71
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad and you will get hurt.</font>

72
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:22,672
<font color=#FFFF00>What about you?</font>

73
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:27,042
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't keep this a secret forever.</font>

74
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Things are already happening.</font>

75
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What will we do from now on?</font>

76
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:39,132
<font color=#FFFF00>All we have left is getting kicked out. Is that it?</font>

77
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You. Han Seong Joon!</font>

78
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:47,602
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you just sit here?</font>

79
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

80
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to that jerk, Lee Hyun Woo...</font>

81
00:04:54,132 --> 00:04:55,572
<font color=#FFFF00>and tell him to find my brother, Seong Hoon.</font>

82
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him to get our house back this instant!</font>

83
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. Stop it.</font>

84
00:05:00,872 --> 00:05:03,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. Stop it. Stop!</font>

85
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:06,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him to pay the monetary penalty Seong Sik paid.</font>

86
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,432
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you just sit here and do nothing?</font>

87
00:05:10,632 --> 00:05:13,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you stay in this house?</font>

88
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. You can't treat him like this.</font>

89
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,932
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't Seong Joon's fault.</font>

90
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:19,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't it his fault?</font>

91
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,372
<font color=#FFFF00>He is Lee Hyun Woo's brother!</font>

92
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:22,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

93
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:24,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, that's enough.</font>

94
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey. - If you are his brother,</font>

95
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:28,302
<font color=#FFFF00>shouldn't you take full responsibility for this disaster?</font>

96
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:29,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

97
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,132
<font color=#FFFF00>for how long we fed, clothed, and raised you?</font>

98
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this how you repay our kindness?</font>

99
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Jeong Hwa. Come on.</font>

100
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- You. Come out now. Come out! - You...</font>

101
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,632
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me. - Come out!</font>

102
00:05:41,702 --> 00:05:44,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your brother! You, jerk.</font>

103
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:46,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at him. He's doing nothing.</font>

104
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,302
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me go. I'm not done with him. - Goodness.</font>

105
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:56,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it! Be quiet!</font>

106
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,672
<font color=#FFFF00>How can a girl be so strong?</font>

107
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You are as loud as a train too!</font>

108
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:05,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you bring her here?</font>

109
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:08,802
<font color=#FFFF00>What was I supposed to do?</font>

110
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:10,402
<font color=#FFFF00>If I leave her on the second floor,</font>

111
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,632
<font color=#FFFF00>she might end up beating up Seong Joon.</font>

112
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think that's the only thing I'll do?</font>

113
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let that sibling off easy.</font>

114
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa! Can't you be quiet?</font>

115
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,872
<font color=#FFFF00>The midterm week will start the day after tomorrow for our children.</font>

116
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:26,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to keep this up?</font>

117
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Please keep it down!</font>

118
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,272
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the first...</font>

119
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,732
<font color=#FFFF00>midterm in their third year of middle school.</font>

120
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:41,972
<font color=#FFFF00>If you keep this up and they don't do well on their exams,</font>

121
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,802
<font color=#FFFF00>are you going to be held responsible?</font>

122
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Hee Sook.</font>

123
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:50,732
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you talk about their education when our house is ruined?</font>

124
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:53,902
<font color=#FFFF00>If I don't talk about their education,</font>

125
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:56,202
<font color=#FFFF00>what would I talk about?</font>

126
00:06:56,972 --> 00:07:00,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I badmouth Father who has suffered all these years...</font>

127
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:02,602
<font color=#FFFF00>by bringing up what happened 23 years ago?</font>

128
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Or should I come up with a plan about Seong Joon...</font>

129
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:07,002
<font color=#FFFF00>who lost his family and grew up uncomfortably.</font>

130
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Or should I...</font>

131
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:12,172
<font color=#FFFF00>talk about our wretched feelings...</font>

132
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:14,172
<font color=#FFFF00>at Hye Joo...</font>

133
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:17,272
<font color=#FFFF00>whose husband, Seong Hoon...</font>

134
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:19,502
<font color=#FFFF00>ruined our family?</font>

135
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:22,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I do that instead?</font>

136
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Sit down.</font>

137
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

138
00:07:29,872 --> 00:07:31,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't heard from Seong Hoon yet?</font>

139
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:33,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Not yet.</font>

140
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I go out and look for him?</font>

141
00:07:37,302 --> 00:07:39,632
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he committed suicide somewhere?</font>

142
00:07:39,802 --> 00:07:41,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

143
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:44,232
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times have I told you to take care of your husband?</font>

144
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:46,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon is a softie.</font>

145
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know that he lives well when he's being taken care of...</font>

146
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,572
<font color=#FFFF00>after spending all these years with him?</font>

147
00:07:51,102 --> 00:07:53,702
<font color=#FFFF00>How bad were you taking care of him to cause this mess?</font>

148
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

149
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:58,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should report to the police.</font>

150
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:00,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree.</font>

151
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,672
<font color=#FFFF00>We should report to the police. They will form a search party for him.</font>

152
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:05,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

153
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:08,772
<font color=#FFFF00>if he moved into the house to take care of Father,</font>

154
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:12,032
<font color=#FFFF00>he should have done that. How could he...</font>

155
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,402
<font color=#FFFF00>lose Father's house overnight?</font>

156
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,032
<font color=#FFFF00>What does this house mean to him?</font>

157
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:19,372
<font color=#FFFF00>This house is the only inheritance...</font>

158
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother and Father will pass on to us. Am I wrong?</font>

159
00:08:21,932 --> 00:08:25,272
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he single-handedly lose...</font>

160
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,272
<font color=#FFFF00>this house without talking to us first?</font>

161
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's send out a search party for him and catch him.</font>

162
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

163
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:39,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Was that how you were feeling, Hee Sook?</font>

164
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:42,232
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, it was. - What?</font>

165
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:44,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously. Stop it.</font>

166
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,142
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to find Seong Hoon by all means.</font>

167
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:50,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Since he is weak-minded,</font>

168
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:51,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what will happen to him...</font>

169
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:55,772
<font color=#FFFF00>once he starts thinking of doing something stupid.</font>

170
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,642
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do these incompetent oldest sons hide...</font>

171
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:02,702
<font color=#FFFF00>after they ruin their businesses...</font>

172
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,602
<font color=#FFFF00>and the whole family?</font>

173
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:06,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do they hide?</font>

174
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:09,272
<font color=#FFFF00>They ought to go out and try to solve this mess.</font>

175
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:10,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

176
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:13,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so cruel.</font>

177
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,572
<font color=#FFFF00>He's still my brother.</font>

178
00:09:15,732 --> 00:09:18,642
<font color=#FFFF00>We are about to end up on the streets. How can you say that?</font>

179
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. Where are you going?</font>

180
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to go out.</font>

181
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,232
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo. Let me go with you. - All right.</font>

182
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:31,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously!</font>

183
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:33,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. Hye Joo!</font>

184
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,642
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe them.</font>

185
00:09:39,732 --> 00:09:40,732
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

186
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:56,532
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't...</font>

187
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,142
<font color=#FFFF00>be happening.</font>

188
00:10:50,102 --> 00:10:51,142
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

189
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:55,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you go for a run because you were feeling frustrated?</font>

190
00:10:56,602 --> 00:11:00,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean you did completely destroy a happy family.</font>

191
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:02,072
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be if you are a human being.</font>

192
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,232
<font color=#FFFF00>You seem furious.</font>

193
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:06,302
<font color=#FFFF00>The problem at your family must have gotten quite serious then.</font>

194
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:16,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this what you wanted?</font>

195
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what condition Seong Joon is in?</font>

196
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:24,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I suppose he's still pretending to be their family.</font>

197
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Hyun Woo.</font>

198
00:11:26,172 --> 00:11:27,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything is over.</font>

199
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:31,132
<font color=#FFFF00>He covered up what you and my uncle did.</font>

200
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:34,532
<font color=#FFFF00>He covered for me who once foolishly loved you.</font>

201
00:11:34,632 --> 00:11:36,902
<font color=#FFFF00>He took all the blame by himself. Did you know that?</font>

202
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:39,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have to do this?</font>

203
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:43,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Does Seong Joon have to be hated and kicked out by his family?</font>

204
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:46,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Will that put an end to your revenge?</font>

205
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is the victim of this revenge?</font>

206
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Is my family the victim?</font>

207
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think you and Seong Joon are the victims?</font>

208
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,832
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth happened?</font>

209
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon...</font>

210
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:02,132
<font color=#FFFF00>kneeled down in front of my family...</font>

211
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:04,972
<font color=#FFFF00>and asked for forgiveness of what you did...</font>

212
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,572
<font color=#FFFF00>saying that it was all his fault.</font>

213
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,472
<font color=#FFFF00>After my family lost jobs and honor, they couldn't keep a cool head.</font>

214
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:14,672
<font color=#FFFF00>He let them give him a hard time.</font>

215
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that really what you wanted?</font>

216
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,602
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a pathetic jerk.</font>

217
00:12:22,402 --> 00:12:23,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

218
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:27,172
<font color=#FFFF00>You are such a bad person.</font>

219
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You only care about yourself.</font>

220
00:12:31,032 --> 00:12:34,232
<font color=#FFFF00>You are a self-obsessed person who never cares about other people.</font>

221
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you the other day.</font>

222
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,702
<font color=#FFFF00>That I'm not a good person.</font>

223
00:12:40,602 --> 00:12:43,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I ever tried to hide that I'm a bad person?</font>

224
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. You are right.</font>

225
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:51,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I just forgot that.</font>

226
00:12:56,572 --> 00:12:57,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never forget...</font>

227
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,032
<font color=#FFFF00>the lesson you taught me today.</font>

228
00:13:01,502 --> 00:13:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I've tried to think...</font>

229
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,932
<font color=#FFFF00>that you are doing all this because you are hurt.</font>

230
00:13:06,672 --> 00:13:07,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted...</font>

231
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:10,502
<font color=#FFFF00>to help you heal your broken heart.</font>

232
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:13,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I've held out with that thought in mind.</font>

233
00:13:15,832 --> 00:13:17,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I should probably thank you.</font>

234
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:21,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you, I can finally let go of it and move on.</font>

235
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care, Hyun Woo.</font>

236
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:34,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I will leave...</font>

237
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:37,972
<font color=#FFFF00>all my feelings for you here.</font>

238
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:41,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's never see each other again.</font>

239
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:04,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What a jerk.</font>

240
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:07,072
<font color=#FFFF00>He doesn't even know how much I loved him.</font>

241
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,532
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the last time I'll ever come here!</font>

242
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,272
<font color=#FFFF00>The mortgage on the building of...</font>

243
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:43,732
<font color=#FFFF00>57-17, Bangbae-dong...</font>

244
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:45,832
<font color=#FFFF00>It is 1.5 million dollars.</font>

245
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:46,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

246
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:49,702
<font color=#FFFF00>He borrowed as much money as he could.</font>

247
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,932
<font color=#FFFF00>The term of redemption is 30 years.</font>

248
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:55,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You should repay the principal and interest from the end of the month.</font>

249
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,402
<font color=#FFFF00>The interest rate will change every three months.</font>

250
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:01,502
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a large sum of money.</font>

251
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,272
<font color=#FFFF00>If the principal and interest are past due over two months,</font>

252
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:07,172
<font color=#FFFF00>the bank may foreclose on your house.</font>

253
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - They may attach your property.</font>

254
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,872
<font color=#FFFF00>He just arrived at the office.</font>

255
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:19,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does he look so serious?</font>

256
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:21,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe he can't reach Dong Hui.</font>

257
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:28,772
<font color=#FFFF00>If things go like this, our drama will be canceled.</font>

258
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,532
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

259
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it so hard to air a drama?</font>

260
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:38,002
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with Director Han by the way?</font>

261
00:15:38,072 --> 00:15:40,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. Writer Choi and Dong Hui...</font>

262
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,402
<font color=#FFFF00>are so irresponsible.</font>

263
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:44,802
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't know it yet.</font>

264
00:15:44,832 --> 00:15:46,702
<font color=#FFFF00>We still have some time left.</font>

265
00:15:46,702 --> 00:15:48,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever.</font>

266
00:15:48,702 --> 00:15:49,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

267
00:15:54,602 --> 00:15:56,932
<font color=#FFFF00>What? That's ridiculous.</font>

268
00:15:56,972 --> 00:15:57,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he close them?</font>

269
00:16:19,572 --> 00:16:22,332
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Director Han from Contents Marketing Department.</font>

270
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:26,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to cash in retirement fund prematurely.</font>

271
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it possible?</font>

272
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,802
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

273
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:36,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I also apply for an employees loan?</font>

274
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:40,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

275
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:44,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I will visit as soon as the documents are ready.</font>

276
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:47,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

277
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me out.</font>

278
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:01,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me out.</font>

279
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

280
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:07,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see my grandmother.</font>

281
00:17:08,672 --> 00:17:09,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

282
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Is anyone there?</font>

283
00:17:17,272 --> 00:17:18,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on out.</font>

284
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:33,072
<font color=#FFFF00>You should eat.</font>

285
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairman Bang and Director Bang are out.</font>

286
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:39,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

287
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. She's having breakfast.</font>

288
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,102
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a little late.</font>

289
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll be right there.</font>

290
00:18:11,232 --> 00:18:12,232
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

291
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:14,072
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a gift from Chairman Bang.</font>

292
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:19,232
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't use the internet with it though.</font>

293
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:37,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

294
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,932
<font color=#FFFF00>What is Dong Hui doing now?</font>

295
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:42,632
<font color=#FFFF00>She just had breakfast and went back to her room.</font>

296
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:44,102
<font color=#FFFF00>She ate breakfast?</font>

297
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. And she got...</font>

298
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:48,702
<font color=#FFFF00>a new laptop today.</font>

299
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:51,902
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

300
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Where on earth is Dong Hui?</font>

301
00:18:58,402 --> 00:18:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, sir.</font>

302
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to keep an eye on her.</font>

303
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:05,842
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems she just left last night.</font>

304
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:08,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Go find her.</font>

305
00:19:09,472 --> 00:19:10,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Without Dong Hui,</font>

306
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:13,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never get the will from her.</font>

307
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:16,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Go find Dong Hui as soon as possible.</font>

308
00:19:28,132 --> 00:19:30,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. What is Dong Hui doing?</font>

309
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,932
<font color=#FFFF00>She's at home.</font>

310
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:33,672
<font color=#FFFF00>And I gave her the laptop.</font>

311
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,302
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

312
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you call the sanatorium?</font>

313
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I told them we'll be there in two hours.</font>

314
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:42,902
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Gui Boon?</font>

315
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:45,102
<font color=#FFFF00>She hasn't called me yet.</font>

316
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:46,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you cancel the meeting?</font>

317
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,402
<font color=#FFFF00>It's pushed back to tomorrow.</font>

318
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,132
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Let's go.</font>

319
00:20:50,672 --> 00:20:54,232
<font color=#FFFF00>(Hearty Sanatorium)</font>

320
00:20:59,372 --> 00:21:02,072
<font color=#FFFF00>(Hearty Sanatorium)</font>

321
00:21:02,072 --> 00:21:03,602
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this place?</font>

322
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Hearty Sanatorium?</font>

323
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:11,302
<font color=#FFFF00>(Hearty Sanatorium)</font>

324
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:27,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what this is?</font>

325
00:21:32,702 --> 00:21:34,602
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the DNA test results...</font>

326
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:37,002
<font color=#FFFF00>of Hyun Jeong.</font>

327
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:43,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't I figure it out sooner?</font>

328
00:21:43,972 --> 00:21:45,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I think of it,</font>

329
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,032
<font color=#FFFF00>she looks just like her mother.</font>

330
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:51,402
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not just her face.</font>

331
00:21:52,302 --> 00:21:54,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Even her character is the same as her mother's.</font>

332
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:01,272
<font color=#FFFF00>She's locked up in my house.</font>

333
00:22:02,102 --> 00:22:05,532
<font color=#FFFF00>She keeps making a fuss screaming and yelling.</font>

334
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really...</font>

335
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,902
<font color=#FFFF00>have to do all this?</font>

336
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother?</font>

337
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:40,902
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

338
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,872
<font color=#FFFF00>you should've done my favor in the first place.</font>

339
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I wouldn't have wasted such a long time.</font>

340
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,132
<font color=#FFFF00>And you also wouldn't have had to spend...</font>

341
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:52,972
<font color=#FFFF00>a lonely life...</font>

342
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:56,272
<font color=#FFFF00>in this room like now.</font>

343
00:22:56,832 --> 00:22:59,472
<font color=#FFFF00>You are the worst son the world has ever known.</font>

344
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:04,302
<font color=#FFFF00>It's really humiliating to hear you...</font>

345
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:06,432
<font color=#FFFF00>call me mother.</font>

346
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:11,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel exactly the same.</font>

347
00:23:11,072 --> 00:23:13,632
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Am I not your son?</font>

348
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:15,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Why...</font>

349
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:19,032
<font color=#FFFF00>do you plan to give your fortune to the society...</font>

350
00:23:19,602 --> 00:23:21,702
<font color=#FFFF00>instead of your son?</font>

351
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,232
<font color=#FFFF00>What has the society done for you?</font>

352
00:23:25,302 --> 00:23:27,732
<font color=#FFFF00>None of those who inherited their parents' wealth...</font>

353
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,702
<font color=#FFFF00>led a decent life.</font>

354
00:23:30,372 --> 00:23:31,932
<font color=#FFFF00>None at all.</font>

355
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:34,232
<font color=#FFFF00>But you were going to leave...</font>

356
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:38,072
<font color=#FFFF00>- your fortune to Gwang Ho. - Gwang Ho wasn't...</font>

357
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,332
<font color=#FFFF00>greedy like you.</font>

358
00:23:46,232 --> 00:23:47,572
<font color=#FFFF00>He was competent,</font>

359
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,372
<font color=#FFFF00>clever,</font>

360
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,172
<font color=#FFFF00>and modest.</font>

361
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Your brother was...</font>

362
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,972
<font color=#FFFF00>a human.</font>

363
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:03,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying...</font>

364
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:07,672
<font color=#FFFF00>that I'm not a human?</font>

365
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You let your brother and his wife die...</font>

366
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,472
<font color=#FFFF00>and tried to take money away from your parents.</font>

367
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't give you anything, not even a penny.</font>

368
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Darn it.</font>

369
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:26,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

370
00:24:35,032 --> 00:24:37,332
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't changed at all, Mom.</font>

371
00:24:37,872 --> 00:24:39,572
<font color=#FFFF00>This is too harsh.</font>

372
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:42,602
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you give your money to someone else other than your son?</font>

373
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,802
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what parents must do, right?</font>

374
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:47,632
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't bat an eye...</font>

375
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,802
<font color=#FFFF00>about this matter for the last 20 years.</font>

376
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so merciless.</font>

377
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:54,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jeong.</font>

378
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:57,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave her alone.</font>

379
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:00,972
<font color=#FFFF00>She has nothing to do with this.</font>

380
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,372
<font color=#FFFF00>You already...</font>

381
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,872
<font color=#FFFF00>reported her death, didn't you?</font>

382
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:09,932
<font color=#FFFF00>You should...</font>

383
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:14,502
<font color=#FFFF00>give up on your plan to donate your money to the society...</font>

384
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,702
<font color=#FFFF00>and rewrite your will.</font>

385
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:19,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Or else,</font>

386
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:21,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jung will...</font>

387
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:24,732
<font color=#FFFF00>suffer even more.</font>

388
00:25:29,072 --> 00:25:31,502
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving then.</font>

389
00:25:47,902 --> 00:25:50,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- Keep an eye on her. - Yes, sir.</font>

390
00:26:04,302 --> 00:26:05,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

391
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:27,072
<font color=#FFFF00>This is nonsense.</font>

392
00:26:28,102 --> 00:26:29,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't believe this.</font>

393
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:02,432

00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:09,702

395

<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

396
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:38,572
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk.</font>

397
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what's on your mind.</font>

398
00:27:58,472 --> 00:28:00,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind me. Just leave.</font>

399
00:28:02,632 --> 00:28:05,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you kneel down before them? You've done nothing wrong.</font>

400
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:07,302
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no point in hiding it.</font>

401
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:08,632
<font color=#FFFF00>They'll find it out in the end.</font>

402
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:13,432
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need to make my dad and Jeong Eun suffer too.</font>

403
00:28:14,602 --> 00:28:15,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Myself is enough.</font>

404
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,302
<font color=#FFFF00>So what did they say?</font>

405
00:28:18,002 --> 00:28:20,132
<font color=#FFFF00>What did they tell you when they learned that you're my brother?</font>

406
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:23,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't they tell you to beg for my mercy?</font>

407
00:28:24,432 --> 00:28:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>They're not such people.</font>

408
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you have to do this?</font>

409
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:29,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you won't stop.</font>

410
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:32,532
<font color=#FFFF00>It's undeniable...</font>

411
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:35,272
<font color=#FFFF00>that they used to be my family.</font>

412
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:38,332
<font color=#FFFF00>At the same time, it's true that you're my brother.</font>

413
00:28:39,132 --> 00:28:40,172
<font color=#FFFF00>So?</font>

414
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:44,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll straighten out the troubles you caused.</font>

415
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:46,972
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're done with what you came here for,</font>

416
00:28:47,502 --> 00:28:48,732
<font color=#FFFF00>please go back to where you were.</font>

417
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:52,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think they'd give you a chance to fix the problems?</font>

418
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:54,972
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter.</font>

419
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if they push me away or avoid me,</font>

420
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do everything I can.</font>

421
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,702
<font color=#FFFF00>All you can do for them...</font>

422
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:03,532
<font color=#FFFF00>is give them a small amount of money.</font>

423
00:29:04,432 --> 00:29:07,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Then do you think they'd appreciate it?</font>

424
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,902
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not out of goodwill.</font>

425
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:12,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm helping them because I'm their family.</font>

426
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like I begged them for forgiveness on behalf of you.</font>

427
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,832
<font color=#FFFF00>If you aren't going to help me take care of the problems,</font>

428
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:23,572
<font color=#FFFF00>just leave first.</font>

429
00:29:24,902 --> 00:29:25,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want...</font>

430
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:28,132
<font color=#FFFF00>you to get hurt anymore.</font>

431
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Do whatever you want to do!</font>

432
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,272
<font color=#FFFF00>And see what you can do for them.</font>

433
00:29:41,302 --> 00:29:42,832
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a fool.</font>

434
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

435
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:13,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

436
00:30:25,972 --> 00:30:27,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so hungry.</font>

437
00:30:38,472 --> 00:30:39,872
<font color=#FFFF00>You good-for-nothing panhandler.</font>

438
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

439
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:43,972
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think you're doing? - I'm sorry!</font>

440
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,932
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir, I apologize! - Get lost!</font>

441
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, sir.</font>

442
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

443
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:55,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Mark my words.</font>

444
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:00,232
<font color=#FFFF00>There are things going on around the family these days.</font>

445
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:03,172
<font color=#FFFF00>But you should never let them...</font>

446
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:04,672
<font color=#FFFF00>bother you.</font>

447
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Adults will deal with their own problems.</font>

448
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:11,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Teenagers will do their job.</font>

449
00:31:13,902 --> 00:31:15,032
<font color=#FFFF00>And kids...</font>

450
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:18,602
<font color=#FFFF00>also have their own jobs to do.</font>

451
00:31:18,902 --> 00:31:19,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

452
00:31:24,572 --> 00:31:26,302
<font color=#FFFF00>There's one more thing.</font>

453
00:31:26,902 --> 00:31:29,932
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need for you to worry about the person...</font>

454
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:31,002
<font color=#FFFF00>who has been away these days.</font>

455
00:31:31,302 --> 00:31:32,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

456
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:35,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss my dad.</font>

457
00:31:37,502 --> 00:31:38,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In.</font>

458
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:41,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to stop thinking about him.</font>

459
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:44,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad must be doing fine.</font>

460
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Probably.</font>

461
00:31:49,102 --> 00:31:51,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Then let's start studying.</font>

462
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:54,302
<font color=#FFFF00>You took a shower, had dinner and ate two slices of apple...</font>

463
00:31:54,302 --> 00:31:56,932
<font color=#FFFF00>and a slice of orange after you came back from school.</font>

464
00:31:56,932 --> 00:31:58,632
<font color=#FFFF00>So it's eight at night.</font>

465
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:03,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In, study until 10 at night.</font>

466
00:32:03,272 --> 00:32:04,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

467
00:32:05,232 --> 00:32:07,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo needs to stay in shape...</font>

468
00:32:07,932 --> 00:32:10,572
<font color=#FFFF00>as you have a lesson tomorrow.</font>

469
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:12,602
<font color=#FFFF00>So you'll study until midnight.</font>

470
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

471
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:16,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Also,</font>

472
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:20,232
<font color=#FFFF00>the teen who has been slacking the whole time...</font>

473
00:32:20,232 --> 00:32:22,572
<font color=#FFFF00>while doing magic...</font>

474
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:24,802
<font color=#FFFF00>will start afresh from now on.</font>

475
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of the midterm as an opportunity...</font>

476
00:32:26,772 --> 00:32:28,932
<font color=#FFFF00>to start your new life...</font>

477
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>and study until 3am.</font>

478
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:33,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

479
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,102
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, I understand. - Yes, I understand.</font>

480
00:32:38,402 --> 00:32:39,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Start.</font>

481
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,632
<font color=#FFFF00>"When I arrived, the payment..."</font>

482
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:46,502
<font color=#FFFF00>"Heaven is Cheon, a land is Ji."</font>

483
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:48,502
<font color=#FFFF00>"Black is Hyeon, yellow is Hwang."</font>

484
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,402
<font color=#FFFF00>- "Space is Woo, house is Joo." - "Father,"</font>

485
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,272
<font color=#FFFF00>- "Wide is Hong, rough is Hwang." - "I'll take care of you."</font>

486
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,002
<font color=#FFFF00>"Day is Il, a month is..."</font>

487
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:56,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

488
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:59,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Come. Come.</font>

489
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

490
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go there.</font>

491
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,732
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not him.</font>

492
00:33:08,732 --> 00:33:10,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did he go?</font>

493
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,032
<font color=#FFFF00>How many days has it been?</font>

494
00:33:15,172 --> 00:33:19,372
<font color=#FFFF00>(Missing)</font>

495
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you make something like this?</font>

496
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,032
<font color=#FFFF00>We never know, Hye Joo.</font>

497
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he lost his memory due to shock?</font>

498
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,672
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do then?</font>

499
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I put so much effort into this.</font>

500
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to make it as eye-catching as it is...</font>

501
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,572
<font color=#FFFF00>to catch the attention of every passerby.</font>

502
00:33:35,672 --> 00:33:38,572
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just that looking at the picture makes me cry.</font>

503
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:47,902
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Wait, Hye Joo.</font>

504
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait, Hye Joo. That's a wrong place to lean.</font>

505
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:52,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Goodness.</font>

506
00:33:53,202 --> 00:33:55,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

507
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that? Follow me.</font>

508
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:05,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me. Hello.</font>

509
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:06,672
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance,</font>

510
00:34:07,372 --> 00:34:09,072
<font color=#FFFF00>have you seen a person like this?</font>

511
00:34:10,242 --> 00:34:11,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never seen him.</font>

512
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:14,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Please look at him one more time.</font>

513
00:34:14,572 --> 00:34:16,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I said I've never seen him.</font>

514
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,302
<font color=#FFFF00>- You've never... - Gosh...</font>

515
00:34:18,302 --> 00:34:20,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I've never seen him!</font>

516
00:34:20,302 --> 00:34:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Run!</font>

517
00:34:22,472 --> 00:34:23,502
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe it.</font>

518
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:24,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

519
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:31,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Where on earth did Seong Hoon go?</font>

520
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:38,802
<font color=#FFFF00>(Please wait!)</font>

521
00:34:38,802 --> 00:34:41,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

522
00:34:45,302 --> 00:34:48,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Kids!</font>

523
00:34:49,202 --> 00:34:52,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

524
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:56,742
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

525
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

526
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:08,002
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

527
00:35:23,402 --> 00:35:26,132
<font color=#FFFF00>(Are you struggling now? We will listen to your story.)</font>

528
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:35,772
<font color=#FFFF00>(Emergency hotline)</font>

529
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:42,572
<font color=#FFFF00>(Emergency hotline)</font>

530
00:35:44,872 --> 00:35:45,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

531
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:48,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

532
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do?</font>

533
00:35:50,872 --> 00:35:51,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

534
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:53,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir?</font>

535
00:35:54,032 --> 00:35:55,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

536
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:57,472
<font color=#FFFF00>What do I do?</font>

537
00:35:57,472 --> 00:36:00,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, have courage.</font>

538
00:36:00,402 --> 00:36:01,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Talk to me now.</font>

539
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,032
<font color=#FFFF00>- I know how you feel. - I...</font>

540
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? That's not it.</font>

541
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I accidentally pressed the button.</font>

542
00:36:11,772 --> 00:36:13,972
<font color=#FFFF00>It's...</font>

543
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

544
00:36:16,202 --> 00:36:19,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, calm down.</font>

545
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on for a second. I will help you.</font>

546
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:22,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Life is long.</font>

547
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:25,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make a hasty decision. If you will wait there,</font>

548
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:26,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I will help you right away.</font>

549
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:28,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Slowly. Slowly.</font>

550
00:36:32,532 --> 00:36:33,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir!</font>

551
00:36:40,902 --> 00:36:43,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Kids, it's time for school.</font>

552
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

553
00:36:45,432 --> 00:36:47,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In. Wake up!</font>

554
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, wake up. Wake up.</font>

555
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,632
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you fall asleep?</font>

556
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:05,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Today's the first day of the midterm.</font>

557
00:37:05,302 --> 00:37:07,572
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've studied until the end.</font>

558
00:37:07,632 --> 00:37:09,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Go take a shower to wake yourself up.</font>

559
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:10,742
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make lotus root juice for you.</font>

560
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:17,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness! Is your nose bleeding again?</font>

561
00:37:17,832 --> 00:37:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. What do we do?</font>

562
00:37:23,972 --> 00:37:24,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

563
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon!</font>

564
00:37:34,202 --> 00:37:35,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon!</font>

565
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:36,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom. - Let go.</font>

566
00:37:37,742 --> 00:37:40,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave Ji Hoon alone.</font>

567
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,332
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do with him?</font>

568
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,242
<font color=#FFFF00>(Missing)</font>

569
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:33,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really wear that?</font>

570
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:34,832
<font color=#FFFF00>What else would I do?</font>

571
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:37,102
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to do anything to find Seong Hoon.</font>

572
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:41,332
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable. You are so embarrassing.</font>

573
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you should wear it and go outside too.</font>

574
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you become solemn and desperate.</font>

575
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:48,932
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just like looking for your separated family.</font>

576
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:51,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should...</font>

577
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,832
<font color=#FFFF00>report to the police that he's missing.</font>

578
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:55,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

579
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:57,742
<font color=#FFFF00>he must've...</font>

580
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,102
<font color=#FFFF00>jumped into the Han River.</font>

581
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

582
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:06,332
<font color=#FFFF00>After living with him for so long, you still don't know Seong Hoon.</font>

583
00:39:06,502 --> 00:39:10,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon would never be able to jump into the Han River.</font>

584
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:13,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? If he was such a determined person,</font>

585
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:15,002
<font color=#FFFF00>he wouldn't have made things get this bad.</font>

586
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:16,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

587
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:17,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

588
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:20,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

589
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:24,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell Mom and Dad to come out.</font>

590
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to eat and gain energy...</font>

591
00:39:25,932 --> 00:39:28,002
<font color=#FFFF00>to get back at Hyun Woo,</font>

592
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,502
<font color=#FFFF00>that jerk neighbor, together.</font>

593
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up now.</font>

594
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:36,972
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to eat.</font>

595
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:42,132
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't eaten anything since yesterday.</font>

596
00:39:42,602 --> 00:39:44,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to talk to you.</font>

597
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:50,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

598
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:16,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Will lying down like this give you an answer?</font>

599
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,072
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not doing this to get an answer.</font>

600
00:40:20,572 --> 00:40:23,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing this because I don't have anything to say.</font>

601
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:27,502
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that I don't understand you.</font>

602
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:30,102
<font color=#FFFF00>But I thought about it all night.</font>

603
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:31,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about Seong Joon.</font>

604
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:35,102
<font color=#FFFF00>How shocked would he be?</font>

605
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:38,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon must be the one having the toughest time.</font>

606
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Stuck in between...</font>

607
00:40:41,032 --> 00:40:44,472
<font color=#FFFF00>his brother and our family, Seong Joon can't do anything.</font>

608
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:46,032
<font color=#FFFF00>A drop of tear...</font>

609
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:51,502
<font color=#FFFF00>dropped when he told us...</font>

610
00:40:52,002 --> 00:40:54,432
<font color=#FFFF00>that Hyun Woo is his brother.</font>

611
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:59,402
<font color=#FFFF00>When I thought about it later, I felt so bad for him.</font>

612
00:41:00,372 --> 00:41:01,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now,</font>

613
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:05,502
<font color=#FFFF00>we have to first think about what to do with Seong Joon.</font>

614
00:41:06,102 --> 00:41:09,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to do. I don't know.</font>

615
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up now.</font>

616
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:14,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing, Mother? Goodness.</font>

617
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,832
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness, Mother. - Get up.</font>

618
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:18,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. Gosh...</font>

619
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:21,402
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to get up and eat...</font>

620
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:23,832
<font color=#FFFF00>to think about what to do.</font>

621
00:41:40,902 --> 00:41:43,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I called you to eat. What are you doing?</font>

622
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:45,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Mom?</font>

623
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,172
<font color=#FFFF00>She's coming.</font>

624
00:42:04,602 --> 00:42:05,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to work?</font>

625
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:08,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

626
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:10,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. You should get going.</font>

627
00:42:12,802 --> 00:42:13,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

628
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Seong Joon.</font>

629
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:17,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a meal before you go.</font>

630
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:27,472
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

631
00:42:27,802 --> 00:42:30,402
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want him to have a meal before he goes.</font>

632
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:33,072
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you thinking about eating now?</font>

633
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:42,402
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Here we are.</font>

634
00:42:43,332 --> 00:42:45,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han Seong Hoon.</font>

635
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:47,772
<font color=#FFFF00>You are home. You should get off.</font>

636
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- This isn't my house. - Please get off now.</font>

637
00:42:49,702 --> 00:42:51,432
<font color=#FFFF00>We arrived. This is your home.</font>

638
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

639
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>This is your house, right? Look.</font>

640
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:10,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking about eating right now. This isn't the right time for it.</font>

641
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:13,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, he should still eat before he goes to work!</font>

642
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:14,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

643
00:43:14,832 --> 00:43:16,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you two be quiet?</font>

644
00:43:16,742 --> 00:43:18,672
<font color=#FFFF00>Even the elders of this house are being quiet.</font>

645
00:43:18,672 --> 00:43:21,372
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you kids raise your voice at this early hour?</font>

646
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:23,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to scold you?</font>

647
00:43:26,302 --> 00:43:27,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

648
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:30,242
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

649
00:43:32,302 --> 00:43:33,932
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hi. - Gosh. Mom.</font>

650
00:43:34,032 --> 00:43:36,132
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. Goodness. - Seong Hoon.</font>

651
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,432
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - Seong Hoon!</font>

652
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:39,472
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon. - Seong Hoon.</font>

653
00:43:39,832 --> 00:43:41,742
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh dear. - Goodness.</font>

654
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:44,672
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - Excuse me.</font>

655
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:46,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you his family?</font>

656
00:43:47,372 --> 00:43:48,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we are his family.</font>

657
00:43:49,402 --> 00:43:50,702
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my son.</font>

658
00:43:50,872 --> 00:43:54,302
<font color=#FFFF00>We stopped him from jumping off the bridge last night.</font>

659
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,902
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say? - What?</font>

660
00:43:56,232 --> 00:43:57,302
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

661
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. He stinks. He reeks.</font>

662
00:44:30,332 --> 00:44:31,332
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

663
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,572
<font color=#FFFF00>you borrowed 1.5 million dollars...</font>

664
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:37,272
<font color=#FFFF00>after putting up this house as a collateral?</font>

665
00:44:39,532 --> 00:44:40,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

666
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:48,832
<font color=#FFFF00>What is the monthly interest?</font>

667
00:44:49,872 --> 00:44:52,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. You must have been out of your mind!</font>

668
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:55,072
<font color=#FFFF00>1.5 million dollars isn't a small amount of money you can easily earn.</font>

669
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,932
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you?</font>

670
00:44:57,602 --> 00:45:00,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what happens to us?</font>

671
00:45:01,872 --> 00:45:02,932
<font color=#FFFF00>This house...</font>

672
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what this house means to us?</font>

673
00:45:07,002 --> 00:45:09,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what this house...</font>

674
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,572
<font color=#FFFF00>- means to me? - Oh dear.</font>

675
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:14,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mom.</font>

676
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:15,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

677
00:45:16,472 --> 00:45:17,902
<font color=#FFFF00>we have to start paying...</font>

678
00:45:18,372 --> 00:45:21,172
<font color=#FFFF00>the interest and the principal starting this month, right?</font>

679
00:45:21,332 --> 00:45:23,432
<font color=#FFFF00>If the principal is 1.5 million dollars, the interest alone...</font>

680
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:25,032
<font color=#FFFF00>will be 7,000 or 8,000 dollars.</font>

681
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:27,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

682
00:45:27,732 --> 00:45:30,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if we make money the best we can with the restaurant,</font>

683
00:45:30,632 --> 00:45:32,972
<font color=#FFFF00>it won't be enough money for the interest.</font>

684
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,932
<font color=#FFFF00>How will we make a living then?</font>

685
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:39,032
<font color=#FFFF00>How are we going to educate our children?</font>

686
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:42,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

687
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,332
<font color=#FFFF00>You have lost your mind. You've gone mad!</font>

688
00:45:46,332 --> 00:45:49,332
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to live because of you!</font>

689
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:56,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so quiet? Say something.</font>

690
00:46:00,672 --> 00:46:02,702
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you all be...</font>

691
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:06,332
<font color=#FFFF00>stupid and pathetic?</font>

692
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,332
<font color=#FFFF00>All of you are pathetic.</font>

693
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:10,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

694
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:14,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I am sorry. This is all my fault.</font>

695
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:20,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I can't survive this.</font>

696
00:46:21,172 --> 00:46:24,032
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a complete tragedy!</font>

697
00:46:36,872 --> 00:46:39,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I should go to a nursing home...</font>

698
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,232
<font color=#FFFF00>and live by myself.</font>

699
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,672
<font color=#FFFF00>If I live in the same building with them,</font>

700
00:46:44,272 --> 00:46:46,472
<font color=#FFFF00>my life will end prematurely.</font>

701
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:49,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

702
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:52,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

703
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:56,232
<font color=#FFFF00>1.5 million dollars are...</font>

704
00:47:05,602 --> 00:47:06,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want?</font>

705
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,432
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do with my dad?</font>

706
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:09,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad?</font>

707
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:12,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Remember? You met my dad the day before yesterday.</font>

708
00:47:12,672 --> 00:47:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>You told him to be where you two met the next day.</font>

709
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:18,432
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been there for two days, but he said you aren't coming out.</font>

710
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:19,532
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

711
00:47:21,302 --> 00:47:23,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom! Let me go with you.</font>

712
00:47:24,202 --> 00:47:25,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

713
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:29,902
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. I told him to meet me there.</font>

714
00:47:31,232 --> 00:47:32,802
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been so distracted.</font>

715
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:35,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. I'll teach this jerk a lesson.</font>

716
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

717
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:51,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Our house is already in an uproar...</font>

718
00:47:51,032 --> 00:47:53,002
<font color=#FFFF00>without your help.</font>

719
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:54,372
<font color=#FFFF00>So be quiet...</font>

720
00:47:54,402 --> 00:47:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>- and follow me inside. - Mother.</font>

721
00:47:57,132 --> 00:47:59,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother? Hey, you.</font>

722
00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:00,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You, jerk.</font>

723
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Today will be the last day for both of us.</font>

724
00:48:03,772 --> 00:48:06,332
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mother. - You're sorry?</font>

725
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:08,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You turned my daughter...</font>

726
00:48:08,602 --> 00:48:11,872
<font color=#FFFF00>into a single mom for 30 years and you're sorry?</font>

727
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,302
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, even if I tear you apart into pieces,</font>

728
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:17,332
<font color=#FFFF00>that won't be enough. You jerk!</font>

729
00:48:17,332 --> 00:48:20,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Stop it. Don't do this.</font>

730
00:48:20,172 --> 00:48:21,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off me.</font>

731
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,602
<font color=#FFFF00>While I was distracted,</font>

732
00:48:23,672 --> 00:48:25,872
<font color=#FFFF00>all three of you were plotting against me.</font>

733
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:26,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

734
00:48:27,772 --> 00:48:29,172
<font color=#FFFF00>- You. - Mother.</font>

735
00:48:29,332 --> 00:48:32,402
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I won't be able to see the light of this world from today.</font>

736
00:48:33,072 --> 00:48:34,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Please stop. Mom!</font>

737
00:48:34,972 --> 00:48:36,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I beg of you. Stop it, Mom.</font>

738
00:48:38,402 --> 00:48:39,432
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk!</font>

739
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:47,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at this.</font>

740
00:49:03,202 --> 00:49:04,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

741
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:06,772
<font color=#FFFF00>What is your plan?</font>

742
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:10,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

743
00:49:10,772 --> 00:49:13,132
<font color=#FFFF00>We are about to lose this house.</font>

744
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:16,972
<font color=#FFFF00>The monthly interest is 10,000 dollars. That isn't a small sum.</font>

745
00:49:17,302 --> 00:49:19,502
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you going to pay back all that money?</font>

746
00:49:23,732 --> 00:49:27,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I ought to give Mr. Lee a visit.</font>

747
00:49:27,202 --> 00:49:29,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Look.</font>

748
00:49:30,472 --> 00:49:32,302
<font color=#FFFF00>That Mr. Lee...</font>

749
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:35,002
<font color=#FFFF00>is Seong Joon's biological brother.</font>

750
00:49:35,402 --> 00:49:37,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you even aware of this?</font>

751
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:40,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

752
00:49:41,372 --> 00:49:43,102
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

753
00:49:54,972 --> 00:49:58,402
<font color=#FFFF00>He already took out the maximum amount of loans from the bank.</font>

754
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:02,602
<font color=#FFFF00>He took out private loans to make additional investments.</font>

755
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,102
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he take out...</font>

756
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:09,932
<font color=#FFFF00>mortgages and private loans to make investments?</font>

757
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, starting this month, he has to pay back...</font>

758
00:50:14,072 --> 00:50:16,402
<font color=#FFFF00>the principal and the interest.</font>

759
00:50:17,202 --> 00:50:18,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe the interest of the private loans...</font>

760
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:21,572
<font color=#FFFF00>will be quite a large sum of money.</font>

761
00:50:24,402 --> 00:50:25,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Right now, Sang Woo...</font>

762
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,702
<font color=#FFFF00>has taken out a loan from his company...</font>

763
00:50:29,032 --> 00:50:30,572
<font color=#FFFF00>and has gotten half of his severance pay.</font>

764
00:50:31,002 --> 00:50:33,332
<font color=#FFFF00>He's also gathering all the money...</font>

765
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:37,072
<font color=#FFFF00>he has saved so far.</font>

766
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:38,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

767
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:51,972
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Han Seong Hoon. How should I handle this?</font>

768
00:50:55,272 --> 00:50:58,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't you be going after the con artists instead of visiting me?</font>

769
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,102
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't look like you're in a hurry.</font>

770
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:01,832
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you didn't lose a lot of money.</font>

771
00:51:06,002 --> 00:51:07,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard everything.</font>

772
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:12,402
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you hear?</font>

773
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:16,032
<font color=#FFFF00>You came here because of my father's past mistake.</font>

774
00:51:17,632 --> 00:51:19,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of that,</font>

775
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:22,302
<font color=#FFFF00>you ruined all of us.</font>

776
00:51:28,372 --> 00:51:29,572
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

777
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:35,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

778
00:51:39,172 --> 00:51:40,172
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything...</font>

779
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,502
<font color=#FFFF00>is our fault.</font>

780
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,632
<font color=#FFFF00>So please. Help us once.</font>

781
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:52,932
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

782
00:51:54,332 --> 00:51:55,632
<font color=#FFFF00>sincerely sorry.</font>

783
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:00,902
<font color=#FFFF00>For what are you apologizing?</font>

784
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:11,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm apologizing for my father's past mistake,</font>

785
00:52:12,272 --> 00:52:13,772
<font color=#FFFF00>what's happening now,</font>

786
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:17,602
<font color=#FFFF00>and what's going to happen.</font>

787
00:52:19,472 --> 00:52:20,672
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about all of it.</font>

788
00:52:21,032 --> 00:52:23,172
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault, President Lee.</font>

789
00:52:25,072 --> 00:52:27,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you had a thing...</font>

790
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:28,702
<font color=#FFFF00>with my father.</font>

791
00:52:30,432 --> 00:52:31,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about everything.</font>

792
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:35,032
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

793
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Please overlook it just this once...</font>

794
00:52:39,402 --> 00:52:40,772
<font color=#FFFF00>and help us.</font>

795
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:46,572
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

796
00:52:47,972 --> 00:52:50,832
<font color=#FFFF00>are you saying you will admit your father's wrongdoing...</font>

797
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:52,972
<font color=#FFFF00>and regret it,</font>

798
00:52:53,732 --> 00:52:54,772
<font color=#FFFF00>so you want your money back?</font>

799
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:03,372
<font color=#FFFF00>So you are selling your father for money.</font>

800
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,172
<font color=#FFFF00>All he cares about are his children...</font>

801
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:07,432
<font color=#FFFF00>and you are not like him.</font>

802
00:53:08,772 --> 00:53:11,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop must be very disappointed to know that.</font>

803
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,432
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm begging you.</font>

804
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,572
<font color=#FFFF00>The house...</font>

805
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:20,232
<font color=#FFFF00>means a lot to...</font>

806
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>my parents and grandmother.</font>

807
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care what will happen to me.</font>

808
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:29,732
<font color=#FFFF00>But I just can't lose this house.</font>

809
00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:34,372
<font color=#FFFF00>I was so foolish that I made this mess.</font>

810
00:53:35,472 --> 00:53:36,902
<font color=#FFFF00>If you help me just once,</font>

811
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,172
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do...</font>

812
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:41,932
<font color=#FFFF00>anything you ask.</font>

813
00:53:43,702 --> 00:53:46,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Why on earth did you borrow money from a loan shark?</font>

814
00:53:50,432 --> 00:53:51,532
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee.</font>

815
00:53:51,972 --> 00:53:53,002
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me.</font>

816
00:53:53,102 --> 00:53:56,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give a chance, President Lee.</font>

817
00:53:56,602 --> 00:53:59,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Please. I'm begging you.</font>

818
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:03,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you to leave now. I don't want to see you anymore.</font>

819
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:19,632
<font color=#FFFF00>(Bonus, Severance pay, Loan, Installment savings, Extra pay)</font>

820
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:29,032
<font color=#FFFF00>(Inbox)</font>

821
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:35,732
<font color=#FFFF00>(To Dong Hui)</font>

822
00:54:38,432 --> 00:54:39,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

823
00:54:39,872 --> 00:54:41,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

824
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:44,232
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd call me once things are settled.</font>

825
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:45,932
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you calling me?</font>

826
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:50,132
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if you are doing fine and everything is good.</font>

827
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:51,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried.</font>

828
00:54:54,802 --> 00:54:55,832
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact,</font>

829
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:57,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been through a lot.</font>

830
00:54:59,232 --> 00:55:00,302
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

831
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:02,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you now.</font>

832
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:17,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Go have a meal.</font>

833
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Where were you yesterday afternoon?</font>

834
00:55:39,772 --> 00:55:41,472
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you didn't attend the directors' meeting.</font>

835
00:55:43,102 --> 00:55:44,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you attend the meeting?</font>

836
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:47,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have something urgent?</font>

837
00:55:48,202 --> 00:55:49,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

838
00:55:49,832 --> 00:55:50,872
<font color=#FFFF00>I was busy.</font>

839
00:55:51,672 --> 00:55:52,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

840
00:55:55,772 --> 00:55:57,502
<font color=#FFFF00>Come sit down and eat.</font>

841
00:55:59,832 --> 00:56:02,202
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not happy with all this.</font>

842
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,032
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't like to eat with me, I will come back later.</font>

843
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,302
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to. Have a seat.</font>

844
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:16,602
<font color=#FFFF00>So is everything going well with your writing?</font>

845
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:20,602
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Thanks to the laptop you gave me,</font>

846
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm devoting myself to it.</font>

847
00:56:23,572 --> 00:56:25,802
<font color=#FFFF00>But I can't stay here like this.</font>

848
00:56:25,832 --> 00:56:28,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you at least tell me how long I should be here?</font>

849
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:34,432
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

850
00:56:35,272 --> 00:56:37,672
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about time your grandmother showed up.</font>

851
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:40,202
<font color=#FFFF00>She's coming a little later than I expected.</font>

852
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:45,972
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm done eating.</font>

853
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,032
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

854
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:07,602
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

855
00:57:08,272 --> 00:57:10,372
<font color=#FFFF00>What makes you so upset?</font>

856
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:14,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even care that I'm upset?</font>

857
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:17,672
<font color=#FFFF00>You just have your own way of doing everything.</font>

858
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:20,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see that...</font>

859
00:57:20,972 --> 00:57:23,172
<font color=#FFFF00>everything I do is just for you?</font>

860
00:57:23,402 --> 00:57:25,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you rub it in every time?</font>

861
00:57:27,302 --> 00:57:28,772
<font color=#FFFF00>You are doing it for me?</font>

862
00:57:30,002 --> 00:57:32,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You are doing things just to satisfy your selfish desires.</font>

863
00:57:33,772 --> 00:57:34,832
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

864
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:40,472
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

865
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:42,072
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

866
00:57:42,172 --> 00:57:44,102
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I was born yesterday?</font>

867
00:57:44,202 --> 00:57:47,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I don't know anything about your scheme?</font>

868
00:57:48,472 --> 00:57:51,302
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

869
00:57:51,702 --> 00:57:52,802
<font color=#FFFF00>How...</font>

870
00:57:53,332 --> 00:57:56,772
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you lock up your mother as her son?</font>

871
00:57:58,232 --> 00:58:01,102
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do that to her for 20 years?</font>

872
00:58:03,272 --> 00:58:05,272
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you force her into exile deep in the mountains...</font>

873
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:06,972
<font color=#FFFF00>as if she was dead?</font>

874
00:58:08,232 --> 00:58:09,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you call yourself a son?</font>

875
00:58:10,232 --> 00:58:12,832
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think it is something a human can do?</font>

876
00:58:13,632 --> 00:58:14,772
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

877
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:17,032
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that?</font>

878
00:58:17,172 --> 00:58:19,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing all that?</font>

879
00:58:19,602 --> 00:58:22,232
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you get out of all this?</font>

880
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:24,272
<font color=#FFFF00>This company, this house,</font>

881
00:58:24,302 --> 00:58:26,372
<font color=#FFFF00>and all the fame and fortune you've enjoyed...</font>

882
00:58:27,002 --> 00:58:28,832
<font color=#FFFF00>are yours.</font>

883
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>What else would you need?</font>

884
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:35,402
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

885
00:58:36,172 --> 00:58:38,532
<font color=#FFFF00>wouldn't understand a word I say.</font>

886
00:58:39,272 --> 00:58:42,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Like you said, you just think...</font>

887
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:44,402
<font color=#FFFF00>everything is mine.</font>

888
00:58:45,132 --> 00:58:46,902
<font color=#FFFF00>How foolish you are.</font>

889
00:58:48,632 --> 00:58:50,302
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

890
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,102
<font color=#FFFF00>This company, this house,</font>

891
00:58:53,472 --> 00:58:55,632
<font color=#FFFF00>and all the fame and fortune I've enjoyed.</font>

892
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Even the car you are driving.</font>

893
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:02,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything will be gone once your grandmother dies.</font>

894
00:59:02,732 --> 00:59:04,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything will be over. Do you understand?</font>

895
00:59:05,372 --> 00:59:06,402
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

896
00:59:06,572 --> 00:59:08,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Your spiteful grandmother...</font>

897
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,932
<font color=#FFFF00>didn't leave anything...</font>

898
00:59:11,602 --> 00:59:13,732
<font color=#FFFF00>for you and me.</font>

899
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,532
<font color=#FFFF00>But we've worked...</font>

900
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>so hard for this company.</font>

901
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,472
<font color=#FFFF00>We devoted ourselves...</font>

902
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:24,972
<font color=#FFFF00>to make the company grow.</font>

903
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:26,402
<font color=#FFFF00>That's no good.</font>

904
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:30,302
<font color=#FFFF00>We are getting nothing for that.</font>

905
00:59:31,272 --> 00:59:32,572
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you see it now?</font>

906
00:59:33,872 --> 00:59:36,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing all this for you.</font>

907
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:38,732
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Ms. Oh Gui Boon?</font>

908
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:40,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking for her?</font>

909
00:59:41,272 --> 00:59:42,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother is alive.</font>

910
00:59:42,802 --> 00:59:44,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You can persuade her.</font>

911
00:59:44,902 --> 00:59:47,732
<font color=#FFFF00>She will recognize our hard work.</font>

912
00:59:49,032 --> 00:59:50,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You have no idea...</font>

913
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:52,772
<font color=#FFFF00>what kind of person your grandmother is.</font>

914
00:59:53,532 --> 00:59:54,702
<font color=#FFFF00>She will...</font>

915
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,772
<font color=#FFFF00>never redo her will.</font>

916
00:59:57,872 --> 00:59:59,702
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I need Gui Boon.</font>

917
01:00:00,402 --> 01:00:03,372
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I need Hyun Jeong who's been taken care of by Gui Boon.</font>

918
01:00:04,302 --> 01:00:06,972
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What does that mean?</font>

919
01:00:08,102 --> 01:00:10,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you understand?</font>

920
01:00:12,732 --> 01:00:14,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui in that room.</font>

921
01:00:15,772 --> 01:00:17,202
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is...</font>

922
01:00:18,772 --> 01:00:19,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Hyun Jeong.</font>

923
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:33,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Darn it. I don't want to eat with her either.</font>

924
01:00:33,532 --> 01:00:35,302
<font color=#FFFF00>What a brat.</font>

925
01:00:43,902 --> 01:00:46,702
<font color=#FFFF00>It's almost over.</font>

926
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:48,372
<font color=#FFFF00>As soon as...</font>

927
01:00:49,872 --> 01:00:52,232
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon comes here with the key to the safe,</font>

928
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:53,272
<font color=#FFFF00>it will be over.</font>

929
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:57,432
<font color=#FFFF00>All you need to do is sit and watch.</font>

930
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park.</font>

931
01:01:34,402 --> 01:01:36,502
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do now?</font>

932
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:38,902
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry,</font>

933
01:01:39,572 --> 01:01:43,272
<font color=#FFFF00>but I have no choice for my poor Dong Hui.</font>

934
01:01:45,032 --> 01:01:47,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I never thought it'd end up like this.</font>

935
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:49,732
<font color=#FFFF00>Decades of work...</font>

936
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:52,232
<font color=#FFFF00>is going down the drain.</font>

937
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:57,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

938
01:02:19,232 --> 01:02:20,272
<font color=#FFFF00>So you mean...</font>

939
01:02:21,432 --> 01:02:23,372
<font color=#FFFF00>there's no way, right?</font>

940
01:02:25,272 --> 01:02:26,402
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

941
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:28,802
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's sell it.</font>

942
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:31,972
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

943
01:02:33,172 --> 01:02:34,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's sell this house.</font>

944
01:02:35,472 --> 01:02:36,532
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

945
01:02:38,732 --> 01:02:40,572
<font color=#FFFF00>This house means a lot to you.</font>

946
01:02:41,972 --> 01:02:44,632
<font color=#FFFF00>You built it with the money your parents left to you.</font>

947
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,502
<font color=#FFFF00>You gave birth to Hyung Seop,</font>

948
01:02:46,602 --> 01:02:48,472
<font color=#FFFF00>raised him, and married him off in this house.</font>

949
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:49,972
<font color=#FFFF00>This is where...</font>

950
01:02:50,232 --> 01:02:52,632
<font color=#FFFF00>your grandchildren and great-grandchildren were born.</font>

951
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:55,772
<font color=#FFFF00>I should save my kids first.</font>

952
01:02:56,602 --> 01:02:59,332
<font color=#FFFF00>They're having such a hard time.</font>

953
01:02:59,332 --> 01:03:02,772
<font color=#FFFF00>This house means nothing when my kids are suffering.</font>

954
01:03:04,702 --> 01:03:05,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

955
01:03:07,532 --> 01:03:08,702
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

956
01:03:10,272 --> 01:03:11,602
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

957
01:03:13,402 --> 01:03:14,502
<font color=#FFFF00>My house...</font>

958
01:03:16,432 --> 01:03:19,472
<font color=#FFFF00>doesn't have to be this building.</font>

959
01:03:20,932 --> 01:03:21,932
<font color=#FFFF00>The place...</font>

960
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:24,702
<font color=#FFFF00>in which I can live with my children...</font>

961
01:03:25,372 --> 01:03:27,972
<font color=#FFFF00>is my house.</font>

962
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,972
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't be so sad...</font>

963
01:03:31,272 --> 01:03:32,732
<font color=#FFFF00>about selling this house.</font>

964
01:03:34,502 --> 01:03:36,932
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault.</font>

965
01:03:38,502 --> 01:03:40,032
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, Mom.</font>

966
01:03:42,002 --> 01:03:45,602
<font color=#FFFF00>You know many things can happen in our life.</font>

967
01:03:48,972 --> 01:03:51,032
<font color=#FFFF00>If we don't want to face rough rides,</font>

968
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:55,032
<font color=#FFFF00>we should die early.</font>

969
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:57,032
<font color=#FFFF00>If we don't like that option,</font>

970
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,372
<font color=#FFFF00>we must not have been born.</font>

971
01:04:01,832 --> 01:04:04,332
<font color=#FFFF00>But we were born...</font>

972
01:04:04,402 --> 01:04:05,702
<font color=#FFFF00>and we have to live.</font>

973
01:04:08,732 --> 01:04:10,172
<font color=#FFFF00>We will have...</font>

974
01:04:11,872 --> 01:04:13,902
<font color=#FFFF00>good times again later.</font>

975
01:04:16,972 --> 01:04:18,802
<font color=#FFFF00>So let's just sell this house.</font>

976
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:22,302
<font color=#FFFF00>If all of us go out and work,</font>

977
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:27,672
<font color=#FFFF00>we might be able to buy a bigger place someday.</font>

978
01:04:29,702 --> 01:04:30,902
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

979
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,872
<font color=#FFFF00>stop hesitating and just sell this house.</font>

980
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:36,702
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, we can't do that.</font>

981
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:39,072
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't sell this house.</font>

982
01:04:39,372 --> 01:04:42,032
<font color=#FFFF00>We can never do that, Mother.</font>

983
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:58,402
<font color=#FFFF00>Guys, clean up. Someone wants to look at the house.</font>

984
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:00,272
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's coming?</font>

985
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:02,702
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? We'll have visitors soon.</font>

986
01:05:04,172 --> 01:05:05,432
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome.</font>

987
01:05:05,772 --> 01:05:08,102
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm happy that someone wants to buy it this quickly.</font>

988
01:05:08,102 --> 01:05:10,632
<font color=#FFFF00>You know the location of this place is really good.</font>

989
01:05:11,272 --> 01:05:12,372
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come in.</font>

990
01:05:19,102 --> 01:05:20,132
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

991
01:05:31,632 --> 01:05:32,632
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

992
01:05:58,572 --> 01:06:00,232
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

993
01:06:00,902 --> 01:06:02,872
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out. Get out now!</font>

994
01:06:03,432 --> 01:06:06,272
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to move out in few days.</font>

995
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:07,332
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

996
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:09,402
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this?</font>

997
01:06:09,972 --> 01:06:12,872
<font color=#FFFF00>- What on earth is going on? - Gui Boon.</font>

998
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:15,772
<font color=#FFFF00>- He got a loan? - Hey.</font>

999
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:18,072
<font color=#FFFF00>Go get Han Seong Hoon!</font>

1000
01:06:18,532 --> 01:06:20,402
<font color=#FFFF00>We'd better not let Dong Hui...</font>

1001
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,032
<font color=#FFFF00>know all this.</font>

1002
01:06:22,032 --> 01:06:23,032
<font color=#FFFF00>(DNA test results)</font>

1003
01:06:23,302 --> 01:06:24,332
<font color=#FFFF00>My name...</font>

1004
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:26,332
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>
