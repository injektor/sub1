00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:20,558
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

5
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:23,688
<font color="yellow">I never knew there was such a shabby town in Seoul.</font>

6
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:25,758
<font color="yellow">It's creepy.</font>

8

<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

10
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:50,318
<font color="yellow">See you, Dong Hui.</font>

11
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:32,618
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so anxious?</font>

12
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:35,558
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

13
00:01:36,218 --> 00:01:38,088
<font color="yellow">You're strange today.</font>

14
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:42,088
<font color="yellow">By the way, I can't believe that Dong Hui lives in such town.</font>

15
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,258
<font color="yellow">I can't never live there even if I get paid.</font>

16
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,958
<font color="yellow">It was shocking to find out such a backward region in this city.</font>

17
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:51,158
<font color="yellow">Why don't they redevelop the town?</font>

18
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:55,258
<font color="yellow">They should bulldoze out and rebuild a new town to make Seoul clean,</font>

19

<font color="yellow">right?</font>

20
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,158
<font color="yellow">It was so spooky.</font>

21
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,558
<font color="yellow">I thought it was a shooting place.</font>

22
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,318
<font color="yellow">Let's shoot our dramas in that neighborhood.</font>

23
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:08,558

25
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,018

00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:15,058
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

27
00:02:15,058 --> 00:02:16,588
<font color="yellow">Please stop it already!</font>

28

29

<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my attitude?</font>

31
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:27,518
<font color="yellow">How could you say that in front of her?</font>

32
00:02:27,758 --> 00:02:29,858
<font color="yellow">I just said the town she lives in is creepy,</font>

33
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:32,128
<font color="yellow">not herself.</font>

34
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,858

39
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:12,758

40
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,588
<font color="yellow">We all live in a different circumstance.</font>

41
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:16,518
<font color="yellow">Why do you never bother to care about others' feelings?</font>

42
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,618
<font color="yellow">That's ridiculous, Seong Joon.</font>

43
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,888
<font color="yellow">So you want me to care about her feelings?</font>

44
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:26,258

45
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,258
<font color="yellow">Did you just say I should care about how she'd feel?</font>

46
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:32,718
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to offend her. The building was too old,</font>

47
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,818
<font color="yellow">so I just said what I felt.</font>

48
00:03:35,218 --> 00:03:36,558

49
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,918

50
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:41,018
<font color="yellow">You should think how others would feel before you speak.</font>

52
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:46,518
<font color="yellow">Do you know how terrible it sounded...</font>

53
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:49,918
<font color="yellow">when you said it should be bulldozed out?</font>

54
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,988
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

55
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,518

156
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:13,748
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

157
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,588
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't be able to find you?</font>

158
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,888
<font color="yellow">Can you see me?</font>

159
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:28,388
<font color="yellow">I'm looking at you right now.</font>

160
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:35,718
<font color="yellow">I guess you have shame at least.</font>

161
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:37,588
<font color="yellow">You ran away...</font>

162
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,148
<font color="yellow">and even hid when you saw me.</font>

163
00:16:41,588 --> 00:16:45,088
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I drank too much that day.</font>

164
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,418
<font color="yellow">I knew what kind of person you were,</font>

165
00:16:48,648 --> 00:16:49,988
<font color="yellow">so it's not surprising at all.</font>

166
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:51,618
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

167
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,948
<font color="yellow">I don't know what's wrong with me, either.</font>

168
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:56,618
<font color="yellow">I'm really doing my best...</font>

169
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:59,088
<font color="yellow">to be girlish and modest.</font>

170
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,788
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

171
00:17:02,348 --> 00:17:03,418
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

172
00:17:04,118 --> 00:17:05,948
<font color="yellow">it seems impossible.</font>

173
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:07,988
<font color="yellow">I've tried in my entire life,</font>

174
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:11,088
<font color="yellow">but I always end up like that.</font>

175
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:13,658
<font color="yellow">I'm really bad at romance.</font>

176
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,418
<font color="yellow">The beginning may be romantic,</font>

177
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:19,118
<font color="yellow">but it turns out to be comedy or horror.</font>

178
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:22,658
<font color="yellow">Speaking of it,</font>

179
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,848
<font color="yellow">on that night...</font>

180
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:27,918
<font color="yellow">What about that night?</font>

181
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:29,418
<font color="yellow">Did you do anything...</font>

182
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:31,918
<font color="yellow">to me by any chance?</font>

183
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,188
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

184
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,448
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry. I did it again.</font>

185
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,658
<font color="yellow">I always try not to speak what's on my mind,</font>

186
00:17:39,948 --> 00:17:41,918
<font color="yellow">but I speak it out in spite of myself.</font>

187
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:46,888
<font color="yellow">You're bleeding!</font>

188
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:52,218
<font color="yellow">You should work in the office.</font>

189
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:55,818
<font color="yellow">You got hurt because you're working at a construction site.</font>

190
00:17:55,918 --> 00:17:57,818
<font color="yellow">- I can do it myself. - Stay still.</font>

191
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,588
<font color="yellow">If you don't treat it now, it'll leave a big scar.</font>

192
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,518
<font color="yellow">So why did you...</font>

193
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:08,688
<font color="yellow">make such reckless investment?</font>

194
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:12,848
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you bankrupted that big company.</font>

195
00:18:12,848 --> 00:18:14,218
<font color="yellow">Look how you ended up now.</font>

196
00:18:15,118 --> 00:18:18,288
<font color="yellow">Right, I promised you not to mention your company.</font>

197
00:18:18,948 --> 00:18:20,048
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

198
00:18:24,463 --> 00:18:26,233
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it must hurt a lot.</font>

199
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,301
<font color="yellow">Did you have lunch?</font>

200
00:18:45,518 --> 00:18:46,548
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

201
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,118
<font color="yellow">All I have is ramyeon.</font>

202
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:57,448
<font color="yellow">My goodness. This isn't a place where a person lives.</font>

203
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,388
<font color="yellow">Look, there's nothing in your fridge.</font>

204
00:18:59,818 --> 00:19:02,588
<font color="yellow">I'd better bring my aunt's kimchi here.</font>

205
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:07,818
<font color="yellow">Stop. Let me do it.</font>

206
00:19:08,518 --> 00:19:10,158
<font color="yellow">I'm good at making ramyeon.</font>

207
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:30,448
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

208
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:33,218
<font color="yellow">It's ready. Come eat some.</font>

209
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,588
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

210
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:46,848
<font color="yellow">You want 50 percent of the profit of my cafe?</font>

211
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:50,448
<font color="yellow">I asked neither for the deposit nor the rent.</font>

212
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:52,218
<font color="yellow">This is not a bad deal.</font>

213
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,788
<font color="yellow">I have to stand there and work all day long to make money,</font>

214
00:19:55,788 --> 00:19:58,848
<font color="yellow">and you'll take 50 percent for doing nothing? It's too much.</font>

215
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:01,188
<font color="yellow">Please don't blame me.</font>

216
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,348
<font color="yellow">That's all I can do for you.</font>

217
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,418
<font color="yellow">Your uncle is such a cold-hearted person.</font>

218
00:20:08,618 --> 00:20:11,488
<font color="yellow">So will you sign the contract or not?</font>

219
00:20:13,048 --> 00:20:14,088
<font color="yellow">This is not fair.</font>

220
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:16,418
<font color="yellow">I need to meet with your uncle.</font>

221
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:18,688
<font color="yellow">What will you do, then?</font>

222
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,618
<font color="yellow">I'll persuade him.</font>

223
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,218
<font color="yellow">You said you're not good at it.</font>

224
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,988
<font color="yellow">What if you end up in a ridiculous or a horrible situation?</font>

225
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,448
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

226
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:35,588
<font color="yellow">Please, come on. You said it'll be all right.</font>

227
00:20:35,588 --> 00:20:37,888
<font color="yellow">- Please let me meet him. - What's wrong with you?</font>

228
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:40,118
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you're going to do.</font>

229
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,088
<font color="yellow">- Come on. Let me see him. - Hey.</font>

230
00:20:44,218 --> 00:20:45,658
<font color="yellow">You're so mean.</font>

231
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:47,388
<font color="yellow">What do you mean your kids are switched?</font>

232
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,618
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

233
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,418
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

234
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:58,218
<font color="yellow">Stop and explain it to me.</font>

235
00:20:59,618 --> 00:21:02,588
<font color="yellow">Someone has to explain what happened to me.</font>

236
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:04,718
<font color="yellow">Are you in, Ms. Hwang?</font>

237
00:21:04,718 --> 00:21:06,788
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon and Chang Soo are switched?</font>

238
00:21:07,418 --> 00:21:09,518
<font color="yellow">Are you joking me now?</font>

239
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:11,348
<font color="yellow">Wait,</font>

240
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:13,658
<font color="yellow">what did you just say?</font>

241
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:16,718
<font color="yellow">How on earth could this happen?</font>

242
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:19,618
<font color="yellow">This is total nonsense.</font>

243
00:21:19,948 --> 00:21:22,388
<font color="yellow">They were switched at the hospital?</font>

244
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:25,548
<font color="yellow">It's my fault. I lived too long.</font>

245
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,888
<font color="yellow">If I hadn't, I wouldn't have to see this ridiculous situation.</font>

246
00:21:29,018 --> 00:21:31,388
<font color="yellow">Hyung Seop and Jeong Ae, why are you so silent?</font>

247
00:21:31,388 --> 00:21:33,348
<font color="yellow">Say something.</font>

248
00:21:33,788 --> 00:21:36,018
<font color="yellow">You should say something...</font>

249
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:38,448
<font color="yellow">as their grandparents.</font>

250
00:21:38,518 --> 00:21:40,618
<font color="yellow">We're also about to go out of mind.</font>

251
00:21:40,618 --> 00:21:42,618
<font color="yellow">This is way too ridiculous.</font>

252
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:46,218
<font color="yellow">I can't believe such nonsense actually happened.</font>

253
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:49,218
<font color="yellow">How can this absurd thing I saw on television...</font>

254
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,618
<font color="yellow">happen to our family?</font>

255
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,218
<font color="yellow">You can't call yourselves parents.</font>

256
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:57,918
<font color="yellow">You've raised them for 15 years.</font>

257
00:21:57,948 --> 00:22:00,118
<font color="yellow">How could you not notice that your kids are switched?</font>

258
00:22:00,488 --> 00:22:02,348
<font color="yellow">It's not their fault.</font>

259
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,218
<font color="yellow">They must have been shocked the most.</font>

260
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:06,988
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo...</font>

261
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:09,888
<font color="yellow">How is Hye Joo doing now?</font>

262
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:13,088
<font color="yellow">She has almost lost her mind.</font>

263
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:14,618
<font color="yellow">She didn't even to go work today.</font>

264
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,218
<font color="yellow">Tell Hee Sook to come here.</font>

265
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,818
<font color="yellow">Grandma,</font>

266
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:24,288
<font color="yellow">She's also in shock,</font>

267
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,618
<font color="yellow">and failed to pull herself together.</font>

268
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:31,288
<font color="yellow">That's understandable.</font>

269
00:22:34,348 --> 00:22:36,648
<font color="yellow">We must take care of their moms...</font>

270
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,488
<font color="yellow">more than the kids.</font>

271
00:22:38,917 --> 00:22:42,647
<font color="yellow">What if they fall seriously ill?</font>

272
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:50,718
<font color="yellow">I devoted my life to raise him.</font>

273
00:22:55,288 --> 00:22:57,588
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're the only one who devoted your life to your son?</font>

274
00:22:57,988 --> 00:23:00,088
<font color="yellow">I also dedicated my whole life for Chang Soo!</font>

275
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:06,718
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to Jongno?</font>

276
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:11,548
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to Youngdeungpo?</font>

277
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:16,018
<font color="yellow">Or should we head to Cheongnyangni?</font>

278
00:23:16,018 --> 00:23:17,018
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

279
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:20,148
<font color="yellow">You just got home. Aren't you tired? Please go to sleep.</font>

280
00:23:20,388 --> 00:23:21,788
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo isn't sleepy yet.</font>

281
00:23:23,788 --> 00:23:27,218
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to Jongno?</font>

282
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,548
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to Youngdeungpo?</font>

283
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:31,748
<font color="yellow">Is that a new song?</font>

284
00:23:32,018 --> 00:23:33,888
<font color="yellow">Yes, Chang Soo likes this song.</font>

285
00:23:33,948 --> 00:23:35,418
<font color="yellow">Why does he like trot songs?</font>

286
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:38,718
<font color="yellow">He's so clever that he already knows what life is really about.</font>

287
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:41,918
<font color="yellow">You're such a lovely boy. Dear my Chang Soo.</font>

288
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:45,618
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he'll be a good student as he's awake until late at night.</font>

289
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,018
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

290
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,548
<font color="yellow">Let's study every night with me.</font>

291
00:23:50,818 --> 00:23:52,018
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

292
00:23:52,188 --> 00:23:55,418
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to Jongno?</font>

293
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,918
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Aren't you going to sleep?</font>

294
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,118
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, honey?</font>

295
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,488
<font color="yellow">My Leonardo isn't sleeping.</font>

296
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:20,218
<font color="yellow">What? Leonardo?</font>

297
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:24,748
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

298
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:27,518
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

299
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:30,118
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll sleep. Hold on.</font>

300
00:24:30,748 --> 00:24:32,488
<font color="yellow">I'll be quiet.</font>

301
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,788
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, I finished your science homework.</font>

302
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:49,588
<font color="yellow">So don't worry about anything. Just study hard and come home.</font>

303
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:57,048
<font color="yellow">You should've told me about school supplies before, so I can get them.</font>

304
00:24:57,218 --> 00:25:00,618
<font color="yellow">Where would I get 30 yogurt bottles out of the blue?</font>

305
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:09,088
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'll send you the empty bottles...</font>

306
00:25:09,518 --> 00:25:12,348
<font color="yellow">to your school by a delivery service. Okay?</font>

307
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:13,648
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

315
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:56,488
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, get your kite away from mine.</font>

316
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,348
<font color="yellow">I need to fly this before Ji Hoon gets here.</font>

317
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,988
<font color="yellow">I have to take a picture.</font>

318
00:26:01,048 --> 00:26:04,648
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon has to take a picture, too. It's his winter vacation homework.</font>

319

<font color="yellow">It's winter vacation at last.</font>

323
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:42,288
<font color="yellow">Poor Ji Hoon. How can he be in the hospital on the day of our break?</font>

324
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:46,718
<font color="yellow">I'm on my winter break.</font>

325
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:52,548

374
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:24,318
<font color="yellow">Please, just kill me.</font>

375

<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

382
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:59,388
<font color="yellow">If you really want,</font>

383
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:02,648
<font color="yellow">I know a trustworthy laboratory.</font>

00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:28,048
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han, let me pour you a drink.</font>

390
00:30:39,688 --> 00:30:41,748
<font color="yellow">I am sincerely sorry.</font>

391
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,918
<font color="yellow">It's not like you did it on purpose.</font>

392
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,888
<font color="yellow">I'm just sad...</font>

393
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:50,988
<font color="yellow">when I think about the children.</font>

394
00:30:58,588 --> 00:30:59,818
<font color="yellow">It's been a while.</font>

395
00:30:59,818 --> 00:31:01,348
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to meet again in a predicament.</font>

396

<font color="yellow">How's your hospital?</font>

397
00:31:05,718 --> 00:31:06,788
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

398
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:10,488
<font color="yellow">How are your daughters?</font>

399
00:31:11,518 --> 00:31:13,048
<font color="yellow">They're good.</font>

400
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:15,688
<font color="yellow">Now I remember.</font>

401
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:19,718
<font color="yellow">You told me that your youngest daughter is...</font>

402
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:21,988
<font color="yellow">the same age as Chang Soo and Ji Hoon.</font>

403
00:31:23,218 --> 00:31:25,348
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

404
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,848
<font color="yellow">Right now, she's in the States...</font>

405
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:30,618
<font color="yellow">with her sisters and mother.</font>

406
00:31:31,088 --> 00:31:34,218
<font color="yellow">Goodness, all of your family live abroad.</font>

407
00:31:35,448 --> 00:31:36,788
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

408
00:31:49,088 --> 00:31:50,448
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

409
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:52,688
<font color="yellow">my youngest daughter...</font>

410
00:31:53,548 --> 00:31:54,918
<font color="yellow">has a problem.</font>

411
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:56,988
<font color="yellow">What kind of problem?</font>

412
00:31:57,848 --> 00:31:59,088
<font color="yellow">She's in a wheel-chair.</font>

413
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,048
<font color="yellow">Her spine was seriously injured.</font>

414
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,418
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

415
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,648
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - How did that happen?</font>

430
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:55,548
<font color="yellow">I need to convince her.</font>

431
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:58,688
<font color="yellow">If we get her, we might have a shot.</font>

432
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,058
<font color="yellow">I heard that she is very stubborn.</font>

433
00:34:12,058 --> 00:34:13,718
<font color="yellow">I don't think she would reconsider.</font>

434
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,118
<font color="yellow">I still have to try.</font>

435

<font color="yellow">Okay. Give me a call when you meet.</font>

437
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:22,288
<font color="yellow">I'll try to persuade my dad again.</font>

438
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:23,588
<font color="yellow">Good luck.</font>

<font color="yellow">He's trying his best to save the team.</font>

448
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,648
<font color="yellow">It won't look good on his resume as well.</font>

449
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:13,018
<font color="yellow">He was leading the team for three years.</font>

450
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:15,518
<font color="yellow">He will be criticized for its failure.</font>

451
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:18,848
<font color="yellow">Poor Director Han.</font>

452
00:36:00,588 --> 00:36:02,688

<font color="yellow">the contract again.</font>

458
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:24,218
<font color="yellow">You will take 10 percent as the rental fee.</font>

459
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:26,918
<font color="yellow">How could you only give him 10 percent?</font>

460
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:28,918
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it, please.</font>

461
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,118

490
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,348
<font color="yellow">I just want to say thank you.</font>

491
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:05,588
<font color="yellow">Did you have to hug me in front of everyone to thank me?</font>

492
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:08,748
<font color="yellow">Did I do that?</font>

493
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,718
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

494
00:38:12,218 --> 00:38:14,748
<font color="yellow">I am not your boyfriend or your husband.</font>

495
00:38:15,218 --> 00:38:16,918
<font color="yellow">You're the nephew of my landlord.</font>

496
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:18,088
<font color="yellow">Right. So why would you hug me?</font>

497
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:22,709
<font color="yellow">Why are you smiling?</font>

498
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:26,188
<font color="yellow">What is your plan today?</font>

499
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:29,218
<font color="yellow">- Why? - If you have time,</font>

500
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:31,818
<font color="yellow">could you go shopping with me?</font>

501
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:33,918
<font color="yellow">Shopping?</font>

502
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:37,618
<font color="yellow">I need to buy a lot of things to open the cafe.</font>

503
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:41,558

504
00:38:42,118 --> 00:38:44,188
<font color="yellow">If you don't come with me, I will tell everyone.</font>

505
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:46,888
<font color="yellow">Tell everyone what?</font>

506
00:38:49,948 --> 00:38:54,218
<font color="yellow">Long time ago</font>

507
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:57,018
<font color="yellow">- David Lee - Okay, fine.</font>

508
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:00,418
<font color="yellow">You should have said yes at the first place.</font>

509
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,688
<font color="yellow">How cute.</font>

510
00:39:12,218 --> 00:39:13,418
<font color="yellow">They are so nice.</font>

511
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,418
<font color="yellow">They're so pretty.</font>

512
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,288
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to have that.</font>

513
00:39:20,218 --> 00:39:21,388
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you stay focused?</font>

514
00:39:22,288 --> 00:39:24,118
<font color="yellow">There are so many pretty things here.</font>

515
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:26,148
<font color="yellow">I can see that, too.</font>

516
00:39:26,888 --> 00:39:29,648
<font color="yellow">Everything is pretty except you here.</font>

517
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:33,418
<font color="yellow">How could you compare me to an object?</font>

518
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:35,348
<font color="yellow">We're friends.</font>

519
00:39:36,488 --> 00:39:37,818
<font color="yellow">Who said that we are?</font>

520
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:40,218
<font color="yellow">We had a meal and drank together.</font>

521
00:39:40,218 --> 00:39:42,918
<font color="yellow">Also, we are shopping together. That's what friends do.</font>

522
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,888
<font color="yellow">Goodness. That is really cute.</font>

523
00:39:52,888 --> 00:39:55,818
<font color="yellow">Why are you buying so many cups?</font>

524
00:39:55,818 --> 00:39:57,688
<font color="yellow">You told me that it was a franchise.</font>

525
00:39:57,748 --> 00:39:58,788
<font color="yellow">Why can't I?</font>

526
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,688
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to have those.</font>

527
00:40:01,688 --> 00:40:04,188
<font color="yellow">That's enough. We are done here.</font>

528
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:07,888
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

529
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:15,888
<font color="yellow">You don't need these.</font>

530
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:19,888
<font color="yellow">You need to buy these.</font>

531
00:40:20,848 --> 00:40:22,588
<font color="yellow">They come in handy.</font>

532
00:40:23,058 --> 00:40:25,388
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to use the drill.</font>

533
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:26,588
<font color="yellow">Who would hang them for me?</font>

534
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:31,088
<font color="yellow">How should I know?</font>

535
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:34,948
<font color="yellow">Maybe you can help me.</font>

536
00:40:35,788 --> 00:40:36,788
<font color="yellow">You're dreaming.</font>

537
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:41,388
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

538
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,688
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

539
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,118
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

540
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:51,788
<font color="yellow">How come you are always away?</font>

541
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,848
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I am busy.</font>

542
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:58,188

543
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,718
<font color="yellow">You should just get married.</font>

544
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:03,448
<font color="yellow">Stop wandering off. How could you run a business?</font>

545
00:41:03,888 --> 00:41:05,018
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

546

547
00:41:07,688 --> 00:41:09,218
<font color="yellow">You are asking me that now?</font>

548
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:13,388

00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:02,152
<font color="yellow">who find out their kids have been switched.</font>

620
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:06,282
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon and Chang Soo are cousins, and they live together.</font>

621
00:47:07,122 --> 00:47:09,222
<font color="yellow">It's not that bad.</font>

622
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,522
<font color="yellow">You should consider how their parents feel.</font>

623
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:16,122
<font color="yellow">They've raised the kids for 15 years thinking they're their own sons.</font>

624
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:19,852
<font color="yellow">Even if you say it's not that bad because they're cousins,</font>

625
00:47:20,052 --> 00:47:21,722
<font color="yellow">it won't comfort them.</font>

626
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,982
<font color="yellow">Let me tell you a thing, Mom.</font>

627
00:47:26,082 --> 00:47:29,122
<font color="yellow">It doesn't make such a big difference whether the child...</font>

628
00:47:29,152 --> 00:47:30,782
<font color="yellow">is your own or not as time goes by.</font>

629
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:32,882
<font color="yellow">Whether it's the child you raised and cherished,</font>

630
00:47:33,052 --> 00:47:36,252
<font color="yellow">or a stranger's child that you've never met, they're all the same.</font>

631
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:39,152
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Sometimes,</font>

632
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:42,122
<font color="yellow">a total stranger is better in some way.</font>

633
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:45,622
<font color="yellow">So, let's not cling onto our children too much. Okay?</font>

634
00:47:45,682 --> 00:47:47,382
<font color="yellow">- Ae Ri. - That's...</font>

635
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:48,422
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

636
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:52,022
<font color="yellow">What? Am I wrong?</font>

637
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:54,052
<font color="yellow">- Get her out of here. - Let's go, Aunt.</font>

638
00:47:54,352 --> 00:47:55,652
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

639
00:47:55,982 --> 00:47:58,852
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Fine. I'll go,</font>

640
00:47:58,882 --> 00:48:00,952
<font color="yellow">- but you know I'm right. - Get her out.</font>

641
00:48:00,952 --> 00:48:03,782
<font color="yellow">- Think about it. - Get her out, lock the door,</font>

642
00:48:03,782 --> 00:48:06,152
<font color="yellow">- and sprinkle some salt. - Sprinkle a lot of it.</font>

643
00:48:06,382 --> 00:48:08,922
<font color="yellow">My gosh. What's wrong with her?</font>

644
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:10,782
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

645
00:48:12,822 --> 00:48:13,882
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh.</font>

646
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:16,882
<font color="yellow">I think it's time for us to make a decision.</font>

647
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,282
<font color="yellow">But I don't know...</font>

648
00:48:19,482 --> 00:48:22,152
<font color="yellow">how we should handle this situation.</font>

649
00:48:23,582 --> 00:48:25,222
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

650
00:48:25,722 --> 00:48:28,052
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do, either.</font>

651
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:29,982
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

652
00:48:29,982 --> 00:48:33,382
<font color="yellow">this is all because their parents lack virtue.</font>

653
00:48:34,922 --> 00:48:36,222
<font color="yellow">Their parents lack virtue?</font>

654
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:40,082
<font color="yellow">Their parents shouldn't have looked out for their children only.</font>

655
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:42,122
<font color="yellow">They should have done...</font>

656
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:45,382
<font color="yellow">many good deeds for the world, too.</font>

657
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,982
<font color="yellow">Are you saying this happened...</font>

658
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:50,082
<font color="yellow">because my children are sinful?</font>

659
00:48:51,482 --> 00:48:52,552
<font color="yellow">I'm just...</font>

660
00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:57,152
<font color="yellow">looking at the bigger picture.</font>

661
00:48:57,152 --> 00:48:58,852
<font color="yellow">I don't care if it's bigger or small.</font>

662
00:48:58,882 --> 00:49:02,322
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say this in front of the kids.</font>

663
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,552
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Let's stop.</font>

664
00:49:10,382 --> 00:49:12,682
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what are you going to do now?</font>

665
00:49:17,752 --> 00:49:19,322
<font color="yellow">Stop crying.</font>

666
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:26,852
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

667
00:49:29,752 --> 00:49:30,982
<font color="yellow">I can't let him go.</font>

668
00:49:31,922 --> 00:49:33,352
<font color="yellow">I can never let him go.</font>

669
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:34,952
<font color="yellow">You know that.</font>

670
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:39,382
<font color="yellow">I know. I do. I'm his father, too.</font>

671
00:49:39,752 --> 00:49:40,982
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

672
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:43,752
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo isn't so smart,</font>

673
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:46,722
<font color="yellow">but he is a perfect son.</font>

674
00:49:47,682 --> 00:49:50,452
<font color="yellow">He's nice, kind-hearted,</font>

675
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:52,352
<font color="yellow">and cares his sister well.</font>

676
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:55,382
<font color="yellow">He's good at playing games,</font>

677
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:57,282
<font color="yellow">and he is...</font>

678
00:49:57,952 --> 00:50:00,222
<font color="yellow">such a fun person to play with.</font>

679
00:50:02,482 --> 00:50:05,152
<font color="yellow">He also sleeps 10 hours a day.</font>

680
00:50:05,882 --> 00:50:09,152
<font color="yellow">No one can sleep well and healthy like Chang Soo.</font>

681
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:11,522
<font color="yellow">Also...</font>

682
00:50:14,152 --> 00:50:15,452
<font color="yellow">he eats...</font>

683
00:50:15,622 --> 00:50:19,722
<font color="yellow">everything so well.</font>

684
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:23,982
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's just raise both Ji Hoon and Chang Soo.</font>

685
00:50:25,382 --> 00:50:28,322
<font color="yellow">No matter what I do, I'll make more money.</font>

686
00:50:28,822 --> 00:50:30,852
<font color="yellow">Let's just raise them both.</font>

687
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,722
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - I know.</font>

688
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:34,882
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

689
00:50:48,222 --> 00:50:50,122
<font color="yellow">Aunt is in the hospital,</font>

690
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:52,722
<font color="yellow">and Mom keeps crying.</font>

691
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,122
<font color="yellow">I'm sure there is something going on in our house.</font>

692
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,152
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one who doesn't know it.</font>

693
00:51:18,082 --> 00:51:19,252
<font color="yellow">What can it be?</font>

694
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,882
<font color="yellow">What's going on in our house?</font>

695
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:31,322
<font color="yellow">Grandma, it's me.</font>

696
00:51:33,322 --> 00:51:36,322
<font color="yellow">- What is it? - I was wondering how Hye Joo was.</font>

697
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:41,982
<font color="yellow">- She must be crying a lot. - That's not all.</font>

698
00:51:42,382 --> 00:51:45,982
<font color="yellow">I'm worried that it might ruin her health.</font>

699
00:51:47,122 --> 00:51:49,252
<font color="yellow">What should we do? I feel terrible, too.</font>

700
00:51:49,652 --> 00:51:51,282
<font color="yellow">What can we do?</font>

701
00:51:51,982 --> 00:51:53,922
<font color="yellow">They should just follow their fate.</font>

702
00:51:54,582 --> 00:51:57,552
<font color="yellow">- Grandma. - You should focus on your work.</font>

703
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,222
<font color="yellow">Keep your head on straight.</font>

704
00:52:02,082 --> 00:52:04,082
<font color="yellow">- I'm hanging up now. - Okay.</font>

705
00:52:11,552 --> 00:52:12,652
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

706
00:52:24,852 --> 00:52:25,922
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim.</font>

707
00:52:26,052 --> 00:52:28,382
<font color="yellow">- Did you revise the budget? - I did.</font>

708
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:30,552
<font color="yellow">I posted it online. Print it out right away.</font>

709
00:52:30,552 --> 00:52:33,052
<font color="yellow">- Dong Hui. Please print it out. - Okay.</font>

710
00:52:42,582 --> 00:52:45,152
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon!</font>

711
00:52:46,322 --> 00:52:48,252
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

712
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:57,482
<font color="yellow">Director Bang. Are you ready?</font>

713
00:52:58,552 --> 00:53:01,082
<font color="yellow">Yes. I got the contract ready for the investors.</font>

714
00:53:01,082 --> 00:53:03,022
<font color="yellow">We only have to make a contract with the writer now, right?</font>

715
00:53:03,022 --> 00:53:05,052
<font color="yellow">We can meet with Writer Jo within this week.</font>

716
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:06,722
<font color="yellow">But we still need a backup plan,</font>

717
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,982
<font color="yellow">so I set up meetings with Writer Kim Mi Kyung and Writer Lee Jung Min.</font>

718
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,352
<font color="yellow">- I'll contact them just in case. - Let me come with you.</font>

719
00:53:11,452 --> 00:53:13,822
<font color="yellow">I know Writer Lee Jung Min.</font>

720
00:53:13,822 --> 00:53:15,752
<font color="yellow">I can convince her when it comes to the pinch.</font>

721
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:21,382
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim. Please send an email to Writer Jo with a contract.</font>

722
00:53:21,452 --> 00:53:22,452
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

723
00:53:22,722 --> 00:53:25,322
<font color="yellow">- Where is the budget bill? - Dong Hui.</font>

724
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:34,222
<font color="yellow">Come on, Seong Joon.</font>

725
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:42,782
<font color="yellow">Good luck, Director Han.</font>

726
00:53:43,622 --> 00:53:46,052
<font color="yellow">Things are going crazy in Contents Team.</font>

727
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:47,622
<font color="yellow">How terrible.</font>

728
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:49,352
<font color="yellow">We'll be fine.</font>

729
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:51,382
<font color="yellow">Hang in there.</font>

730
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,322
<font color="yellow">You said you'd do it, so please do it.</font>

731
00:54:22,622 --> 00:54:23,822
<font color="yellow">You're now...</font>

732
00:54:24,152 --> 00:54:26,382
<font color="yellow">treating me like your subordinate.</font>

733
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:28,122
<font color="yellow">You said you'd do it.</font>

734
00:54:29,452 --> 00:54:30,482
<font color="yellow">When did I say that?</font>

735
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:33,322
<font color="yellow">You said you'd do it. Think carefully.</font>

736
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:48,922
<font color="yellow">You're renting this place for free, and I'm working for you for free.</font>

737
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,822
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's too much?</font>

738
00:54:51,252 --> 00:54:54,352
<font color="yellow">I'll make you delicious coffee in return.</font>

739
00:55:09,652 --> 00:55:12,222
<font color="yellow">You aren't going to sleep here, are you?</font>

740
00:55:12,282 --> 00:55:13,352
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that?</font>

741
00:55:14,082 --> 00:55:16,052
<font color="yellow">You have a house to sleep in.</font>

742
00:55:16,452 --> 00:55:17,882
<font color="yellow">Do you like sleeping in the open?</font>

743
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:20,422
<font color="yellow">Things are crazy at my grandma's house,</font>

744
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:22,282
<font color="yellow">and I'm not on good terms with my mom.</font>

745
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,152
<font color="yellow">That's why I set out on a trip,</font>

746
00:55:25,982 --> 00:55:28,122
<font color="yellow">and I met you in New York.</font>

747
00:55:28,752 --> 00:55:32,352
<font color="yellow">But even after I came back, nothing is different between me and my mom.</font>

748
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:37,152
<font color="yellow">I guess your mother...</font>

749
00:55:37,982 --> 00:55:39,322
<font color="yellow">let you do this kind of things.</font>

750
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:44,882
<font color="yellow">She neglected me even when I was just born.</font>

751
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:49,522
<font color="yellow">So, if I make money from this cafe,</font>

752
00:55:49,882 --> 00:55:51,682
<font color="yellow">I'll go abroad again.</font>

753
00:55:52,752 --> 00:55:53,752
<font color="yellow">When I do,</font>

754
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:56,582
<font color="yellow">I won't come back.</font>

755
00:55:57,482 --> 00:55:58,752
<font color="yellow">My mom...</font>

756
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,422
<font color="yellow">and my family don't like me that much.</font>

757
00:56:10,322 --> 00:56:11,652
<font color="yellow">That's none of my business.</font>

758
00:57:07,622 --> 00:57:09,352
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, we're home.</font>

759
00:57:09,722 --> 00:57:12,382
<font color="yellow">Just hang in there a little longer. Gosh, be careful.</font>

760
00:57:12,782 --> 00:57:14,222
<font color="yellow">Be careful, okay?</font>

761
00:57:14,452 --> 00:57:16,282
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Hee Sook.</font>

762
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:17,722
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

763
00:57:19,582 --> 00:57:20,622
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

764
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:22,122
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

765
00:57:26,122 --> 00:57:27,322
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Hee Sook.</font>

766
00:57:27,882 --> 00:57:28,882
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

767
00:57:29,352 --> 00:57:31,752
<font color="yellow">Please try to get your strength back.</font>

768
00:57:31,882 --> 00:57:33,852
<font color="yellow">Please get your strength back.</font>

769
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:43,722
<font color="yellow">You should take care of your health, so you won't be sick again.</font>

770
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:47,022
<font color="yellow">Okay, Uncle. Thank you for everything.</font>

771
00:57:47,252 --> 00:57:48,452
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

772
00:57:48,722 --> 00:57:51,082
<font color="yellow">All right, Ji Hoon. Get home safely.</font>

773
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:52,922
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

774
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:22,922
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

775
00:58:23,822 --> 00:58:25,422
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

776
00:58:26,282 --> 00:58:27,282
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

777
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:28,752
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

778
00:58:30,252 --> 00:58:31,282
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

779
00:58:31,952 --> 00:58:34,222
<font color="yellow">No. You are...</font>

780
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:35,882
<font color="yellow">my son.</font>

781
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:37,622
<font color="yellow">Yes...</font>

782
00:58:39,752 --> 00:58:41,652
<font color="yellow">You're my son.</font>

783
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:44,082
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

784
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:49,982
<font color="yellow">We are...</font>

785
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:54,682
<font color="yellow">so sorry, Chang Soo.</font>

786
00:58:56,852 --> 00:58:59,222
<font color="yellow">No. I can't...</font>

787
00:58:59,822 --> 00:59:02,252
<font color="yellow">let him go. I can't let him go.</font>

788
00:59:02,452 --> 00:59:03,622
<font color="yellow">I can never do that.</font>

789
00:59:04,052 --> 00:59:05,382
<font color="yellow">I'll raise him.</font>

790
00:59:05,682 --> 00:59:09,522
<font color="yellow">I'll raise him. I'll raise him.</font>

791
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:12,682
<font color="yellow">Am I really...</font>

792
00:59:13,452 --> 00:59:15,152
<font color="yellow">Aunt's son?</font>

793
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,382
<font color="yellow">I'll raise him.</font>

794
00:59:22,552 --> 00:59:23,622
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

795
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:29,022
<font color="yellow">We're all very sorry to you.</font>

796
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:32,222
<font color="yellow">But sometimes, even grown-ups...</font>

797
00:59:33,022 --> 00:59:34,622
<font color="yellow">make mistakes.</font>

798
00:59:35,152 --> 00:59:36,152
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

799
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:39,482
<font color="yellow">this isn't something we can mess up with.</font>

800
00:59:39,682 --> 00:59:41,752
<font color="yellow">We are truly sorry.</font>

801
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,722
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

802
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:46,582
<font color="yellow">we want to hear your thoughts.</font>

803
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:49,852
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo. Go ahead.</font>

804
00:59:50,452 --> 00:59:52,682
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that my mom has raised me so far,</font>

805
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:56,752
<font color="yellow">and I think she regrets that she hasn't been feeding me well.</font>

806
00:59:58,122 --> 00:59:59,322
<font color="yellow">I'll just...</font>

807
01:00:00,022 --> 01:00:01,652
<font color="yellow">continue to live with my parents.</font>

808
01:00:01,982 --> 01:00:03,352
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Seong Hoon.</font>

809
01:00:04,052 --> 01:00:05,822
<font color="yellow">My dear Chang Soo.</font>

810
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:07,652
<font color="yellow">That's right, my baby.</font>

811
01:00:08,022 --> 01:00:09,082
<font color="yellow">Don't touch me, though.</font>

812
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:10,982
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

813
01:00:11,682 --> 01:00:14,382
<font color="yellow">Let's hear what Ji Hoon thinks.</font>

814
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:17,082
<font color="yellow">I want...</font>

815
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:20,482
<font color="yellow">to live in the basement.</font>

816
01:00:24,652 --> 01:00:28,222
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. What are you saying, you brat?</font>

817
01:00:28,722 --> 01:00:31,082
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful that my parents have raised me so far,</font>

818
01:00:31,622 --> 01:00:33,882
<font color="yellow">but now I've found my true parents.</font>

819
01:00:34,152 --> 01:00:36,222
<font color="yellow">I want to live with my true parents.</font>

820
01:00:37,252 --> 01:00:39,322
<font color="yellow">I'll move to downstairs right away.</font>

821
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:41,422
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

822
01:00:41,482 --> 01:00:42,952
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon... - You brat!</font>

823
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:44,752
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

824
01:00:45,222 --> 01:00:46,322
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

825
01:00:59,752 --> 01:01:00,822
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

826
01:01:02,114 --> 01:01:03,414
<font color="yellow">You woke up.</font>

827
01:01:04,052 --> 01:01:05,552
<font color="yellow">I guess you were very tired.</font>

828
01:01:06,552 --> 01:01:09,352
<font color="yellow">You didn't sleep for two days. You must have been tired.</font>

829
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:10,352
<font color="yellow">What about the company?</font>

830
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:13,382
<font color="yellow">Go home and get some rest.</font>

831
01:01:13,452 --> 01:01:14,722
<font color="yellow">Don't go back to the company.</font>

832
01:01:15,322 --> 01:01:18,252
<font color="yellow">You stayed up all night at Writer Jo's workroom.</font>

833
01:01:23,022 --> 01:01:25,322
<font color="yellow">It's a relief that we convinced her.</font>

834
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:26,722
<font color="yellow">We don't know that...</font>

835
01:01:27,022 --> 01:01:28,982
<font color="yellow">until she signs the contract.</font>

836
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:31,722
<font color="yellow">I still think she is half convinced.</font>

837
01:01:32,252 --> 01:01:34,822
<font color="yellow">I heard Writer Jo talks a lot when it's close to signing the contract.</font>

838
01:01:35,382 --> 01:01:38,082
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even say a word if she doesn't want to do it,</font>

839
01:01:38,282 --> 01:01:40,222
<font color="yellow">but she talked to you a lot.</font>

840
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:45,282
<font color="yellow">Of course. There aren't any women who won't talk to you.</font>

841
01:01:46,052 --> 01:01:47,422
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

842
01:01:47,852 --> 01:01:49,952
<font color="yellow">Go on and sleep. I'll wake you up when we get to your house.</font>

843
01:01:56,282 --> 01:01:58,682
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi. Things are crazy at home.</font>

844
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:01,082
<font color="yellow">We should stay outside.</font>

845
01:02:15,052 --> 01:02:17,122
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. Get some rest.</font>

846
01:02:23,022 --> 01:02:24,152
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

847
01:02:54,982 --> 01:02:56,722
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

848
01:02:56,722 --> 01:02:58,552
<font color="yellow">I want to live with my true parents.</font>

849
01:02:58,552 --> 01:03:00,652
<font color="yellow">How can he be so cold-hearted?</font>

850
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,522
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything you've done for me.</font>

851
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:06,022
<font color="yellow">Does his uncle have a grudge against people in Bangbae-dong?</font>

852
01:03:06,122 --> 01:03:08,382
<font color="yellow">Give me back my son, you jerk!</font>

853
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:10,782
<font color="yellow">Do you expect me to believe that?</font>

854
01:03:10,922 --> 01:03:13,552
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

855
01:03:13,552 --> 01:03:15,282
<font color="yellow">I never told you we were in a relationship.</font>

856
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:17,122
<font color="yellow">What does it have to do with me?</font>

857
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:19,452
<font color="yellow">Is there someone you like, Dong Hui?</font>

858
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:20,967
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

859
01:03:21,282 --> 01:03:22,752
<font color="yellow">Are you running away because you're scared?</font>
