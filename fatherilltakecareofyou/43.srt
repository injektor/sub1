1
00:00:06,729 --> 00:00:08,129
<font color=#FFFF00>You might hate it,</font>

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,199
<font color=#FFFF00>but I grew up...</font>

3
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:12,929
<font color=#FFFF00>with Dad's love.</font>

4
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:16,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You idiot.</font>

5
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:19,729
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a fact. So...</font>

6
00:00:21,799 --> 00:00:23,129
<font color=#FFFF00>you should leave now.</font>

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

8
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,259
<font color=#FFFF00>want to pay him back...</font>

9
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:29,629
<font color=#FFFF00>at least half of what he's done for me.</font>

10
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:32,359
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You're coming with me.</font>

11
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:33,559
<font color=#FFFF00>If you can't do that,</font>

12
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:36,159
<font color=#FFFF00>just consider me dead...</font>

13
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:39,229
<font color=#FFFF00>like you did until recently.</font>

14
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:46,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

15
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo!</font>

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,059
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 43)</font>

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,469
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been?</font>

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad sold the house today.</font>

19
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,599
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

20
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so sorry, darling.</font>

21
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh...</font>

22
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,859
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing you should be sorry about.</font>

23
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,599
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not just us.</font>

24
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone lives like this.</font>

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Unlike the old times,</font>

26
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,359
<font color=#FFFF00>children drive their parents crazy.</font>

27
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:52,459
<font color=#FFFF00>So it's not your fault.</font>

28
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,999
<font color=#FFFF00>It's our shameless children who are at fault.</font>

29
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:01,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to them, we will be forced out to the streets...</font>

30
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,029
<font color=#FFFF00>at this old age.</font>

31
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:10,499
<font color=#FFFF00>At the age of 60, I thought we'd...</font>

32
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,499
<font color=#FFFF00>have a house, live off our pension,</font>

33
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:16,199
<font color=#FFFF00>travel from time to time,</font>

34
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,499
<font color=#FFFF00>and live happily while watching our cute grandchildren.</font>

35
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I never knew we'd end up like this.</font>

36
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:32,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

37
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother,</font>

38
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,229
<font color=#FFFF00>please have a seat.</font>

39
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,099
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandmother. - Shut your mouth.</font>

40
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:58,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey...</font>

41
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

42
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:18,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have any problem with Chairman Bang, Grandmother?</font>

43
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I have a problem with a person like him?</font>

44
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:24,759
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not meant to live like this.</font>

45
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:26,859
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

46
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've been raised...</font>

47
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,399
<font color=#FFFF00>as a precious daughter in a big house.</font>

48
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of me,</font>

49
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,559
<font color=#FFFF00>you are going through too much.</font>

50
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon had a special relationship with...</font>

51
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:16,059
<font color=#FFFF00>the former chairman, my grandmother.</font>

52
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,629
<font color=#FFFF00>My dad is desperately looking for her...</font>

53
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,599
<font color=#FFFF00>because of our missing grandmother and her will.</font>

54
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,129
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Bang Mi Joo.</font>

55
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:48,129
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean they're trying to scout Director Han?</font>

56
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Which production company is that?</font>

57
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Call me as soon as you find out.</font>

58
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,499
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

59
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:15,169
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at that? Give it to me.</font>

60
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:22,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you? Who are you to come in here and...</font>

61
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Is the lady in the picture...</font>

62
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,099
<font color=#FFFF00>your grandmother, the one you were talking about the other time?</font>

63
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,499
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Your missing grandmother.</font>

64
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,499
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you're trying to find her will.</font>

65
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,659
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you are looking for my grandmother,</font>

66
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>and that's why I'm locked up in here. Isn't that it?</font>

67
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,099
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

68
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:42,899
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

69
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

70
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you look at me like that?</font>

71
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,829
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

72
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,729
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like your family is full of stories.</font>

73
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean my family is full of stories?</font>

74
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,529
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

75
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:03,859
<font color=#FFFF00>That's...</font>

76
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:05,629
<font color=#FFFF00>just the impression I got.</font>

77
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:10,099
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

78
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:13,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't judge my family.</font>

79
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:15,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What does a girl like you know?</font>

80
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:18,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You know nothing, so just stay low until your grandmother comes.</font>

81
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,299
<font color=#FFFF00>That's better for you too.</font>

82
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:22,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Better for me?</font>

83
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Can things get worse than this?</font>

84
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Never mind.</font>

85
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so,</font>

86
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,929
<font color=#FFFF00>you were very hasty when you were reporting...</font>

87
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,729
<font color=#FFFF00>our largest shareholder, Bang Hyun Jeong's death.</font>

88
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep delaying to report...</font>

89
00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:53,899
<font color=#FFFF00>the former chairman's death?</font>

90
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:55,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true...</font>

91
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,999
<font color=#FFFF00>that Bang Hyun Jeong is dead?</font>

92
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Hyun Jeong.</font>

93
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:05,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Who...</font>

94
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,099
<font color=#FFFF00>is that?</font>

95
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,099
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to contact the board members as soon as possible.</font>

96
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried many times,</font>

97
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:25,799
<font color=#FFFF00>but Chairman Bang is watching not only you...</font>

98
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:28,629
<font color=#FFFF00>but also every board member.</font>

99
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,129
<font color=#FFFF00>He's watching their every movement.</font>

100
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:32,759
<font color=#FFFF00>So what should I do?</font>

101
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:35,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried about the chairman,</font>

102
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:39,299
<font color=#FFFF00>but I am the most worried that...</font>

103
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,059
<font color=#FFFF00>something bad might happen to Dong Hui.</font>

104
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:42,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

105
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:44,959
<font color=#FFFF00>it would be dangerous for us...</font>

106
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,429
<font color=#FFFF00>to contact them directly.</font>

107
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Like what the chairman said,</font>

108
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:50,399
<font color=#FFFF00>we need someone who can speak for us...</font>

109
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,529
<font color=#FFFF00>and persuade the board members.</font>

110
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:56,259
<font color=#FFFF00>If old people like us say it,</font>

111
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,359
<font color=#FFFF00>nobody will believe it.</font>

112
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

113
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you say Dong Hui used to work at FGC?</font>

114
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

115
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

116
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Is that Great-grandmother?</font>

117
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I want to talk to her.</font>

118
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:33,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

119
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. It's me. Have you been well?</font>

120
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,269
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother. You are too cruel.</font>

121
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Weren't you worried about me at all?</font>

122
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:45,899
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not sick, right?</font>

123
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:47,859
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your health?</font>

124
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:50,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I am healthy.</font>

125
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Your family and your in-laws' family...</font>

126
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,629
<font color=#FFFF00>are all fine too, right?</font>

127
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a lot to tell you,</font>

128
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,829
<font color=#FFFF00>but I will get to them later.</font>

129
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:03,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Where on earth are you, Grandmother?</font>

130
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I am doing all right. Don't worry about me.</font>

131
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:09,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

132
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I called you because I need to ask you something.</font>

133
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

134
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,799
<font color=#FFFF00>You mean Seong Joon?</font>

135
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,129
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

136
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this.</font>

137
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

138
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I put together the money I have.</font>

139
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you'd need this when we move out.</font>

140
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:05,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you give us this though?</font>

141
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone in our family is struggling.</font>

142
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:10,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother even sold this house.</font>

143
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how else I can be of help.</font>

144
00:10:16,729 --> 00:10:19,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't take out any loan. Don't worry about that.</font>

145
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:21,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Please use it freely.</font>

146
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:22,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

147
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you remember what I told you?</font>

148
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this back. I can't accept this.</font>

149
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

150
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Take this now.</font>

151
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should he? What's wrong with accepting his money?</font>

152
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,769
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

153
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean to say we should use his money to rent a house?</font>

154
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,269
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that Seong Joon brought home his salary...</font>

155
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,129
<font color=#FFFF00>he earned every month without fail.</font>

156
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,999
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants to help because we are his family.</font>

157
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

158
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Then did we raise him for nothing?</font>

159
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:59,799
<font color=#FFFF00>We deserve this money for raising him thus far, don't we?</font>

160
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you were so calculative.</font>

161
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

162
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we talk?</font>

163
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

164
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Sit down.</font>

165
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you...</font>

166
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:35,299
<font color=#FFFF00>resent us?</font>

167
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:36,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

168
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how your fate and mine...</font>

169
00:11:41,729 --> 00:11:43,659
<font color=#FFFF00>became so unfortunate.</font>

170
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:47,129
<font color=#FFFF00>When I heard from your dad...</font>

171
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,529
<font color=#FFFF00>that you were not his biological son,</font>

172
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I was furious at your dad.</font>

173
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that, right?</font>

174
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,459
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that I had a hard time accepting you as my son at first.</font>

175
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am aware of that.</font>

176
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:03,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Regardless,</font>

177
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I did my best to raise you.</font>

178
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:10,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried hard so that no one said you were not my son.</font>

179
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I am also aware of that too, Mom.</font>

180
00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:16,159
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

181
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,959
<font color=#FFFF00>it turns out Mr. Lee across the street is your brother.</font>

182
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Your brother thoroughly destroyed our family.</font>

183
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:27,159
<font color=#FFFF00>At the end, he drove us to the corner. When I think about this,</font>

184
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:30,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I can forgive neither you nor him.</font>

185
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,799
<font color=#FFFF00>If I could, I want to ask him to compensate...</font>

186
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,899
<font color=#FFFF00>for the years I raised you.</font>

187
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you asked for the half of your severance pay...</font>

188
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:49,499
<font color=#FFFF00>and took out a loan from your company.</font>

189
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:53,429
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you find that out?</font>

190
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:56,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo came by the house.</font>

191
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:57,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

192
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,199
<font color=#FFFF00>She gave me money.</font>

193
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,799
<font color=#FFFF00>She said it looked like you had a problem.</font>

194
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,229
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she wanted to help.</font>

195
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:05,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

196
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I accepted that money.</font>

197
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:13,999
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I thought what happened was unfair.</font>

198
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I accepted because I didn't want to give in.</font>

199
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:17,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What could I have done?</font>

200
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,229
<font color=#FFFF00>We lost...</font>

201
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,299
<font color=#FFFF00>this house.</font>

202
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:25,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Your oldest brother...</font>

203
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:28,859
<font color=#FFFF00>is about to be killed by loan sharks.</font>

204
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,629
<font color=#FFFF00>If I could, I want to kill myself too.</font>

205
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo gave me the money,</font>

206
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,429
<font color=#FFFF00>so I took it.</font>

207
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

208
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon said he will pay back the money diligently.</font>

209
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,629
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he won't just forget about that.</font>

210
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,429
<font color=#FFFF00>So you should know this too.</font>

211
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:49,429
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to find a house to live in.</font>

212
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,399
<font color=#FFFF00>With the money from you...</font>

213
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,259
<font color=#FFFF00>and Mi Joo,</font>

214
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,529
<font color=#FFFF00>we have to pay back the private loan first.</font>

215
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:58,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I will talk more later.</font>

216
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:01,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's settle the urgent matters first and we'll resume later.</font>

217
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:04,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

218
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,129
<font color=#FFFF00>we will spend your money wisely.</font>

219
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:10,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell her...</font>

220
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,759
<font color=#FFFF00>that we are grateful.</font>

221
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Get some rest.</font>

222
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did she ask for Seong Joon's number all of a sudden?</font>

223
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she trying to marry Dong Hui and Seong Joon in secret?</font>

224
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Or did they get caught again?</font>

225
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:39,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it, Mom?</font>

226
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,459
<font color=#FFFF00>"What is it, Mom?"</font>

227
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't let that go.</font>

228
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go back to what we were talking about before.</font>

229
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Talk about what?</font>

230
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,559
<font color=#FFFF00>The pills. The pills I found.</font>

231
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you taking those pills?</font>

232
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:10,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Since when did you start taking them?</font>

233
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:11,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

234
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,029
<font color=#FFFF00>You are only 16 years old.</font>

235
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you have to take sedatives on a regular basis?</font>

236
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:21,729
<font color=#FFFF00>On a regular basis?</font>

237
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,499
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not true. A long time ago...</font>

238
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,999
<font color=#FFFF00>When I lived with my former mom,</font>

239
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:31,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I took them because my uncle prescribed them.</font>

240
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

241
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

242
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to tell me the truth?</font>

243
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you the truth.</font>

244
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't take them anymore.</font>

245
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Ji Hoon.</font>

246
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got back from the workshop.</font>

247
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:14,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been well?</font>

248
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle.</font>

249
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a problem.</font>

250
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:18,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

251
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom found the pills.</font>

252
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom?</font>

253
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,399
<font color=#FFFF00>- Which mom? - The mom I have now.</font>

254
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, my mom.</font>

255
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:31,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

256
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:34,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you take them to the kitchen?</font>

257
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom.</font>

258
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:41,659
<font color=#FFFF00>But Uncle,</font>

259
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:44,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so worried.</font>

260
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. You don't have to worry.</font>

261
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:49,399
<font color=#FFFF00>I will explain it well to her.</font>

262
00:16:51,729 --> 00:16:52,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Then...</font>

263
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:54,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I have faith in you.</font>

264
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,829
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

265
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,969
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you surprised?</font>

266
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,329
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you do...</font>

267
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,099
<font color=#FFFF00>in Chang Soo's room?</font>

268
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:18,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I did nothing.</font>

269
00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:24,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, where are you going? It's getting dark.</font>

270
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,129
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with him?</font>

271
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

272
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:33,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

273
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:44,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously.</font>

274
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:48,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Who knew that we would turn out like this at this age?</font>

275
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,029
<font color=#FFFF00>We are bleeding them dry.</font>

276
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Who knew that we would be sucking their blood out?</font>

277
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,529
<font color=#FFFF00>This is embarrassing.</font>

278
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

279
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I am afraid that Chang Soo, Ji Hoon, and Ah In...</font>

280
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:02,729
<font color=#FFFF00>will watch and learn from us.</font>

281
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:03,859
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are afraid,</font>

282
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:06,029
<font color=#FFFF00>how can you cost us the whole house?</font>

283
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

284
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:10,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to live anymore.</font>

285
00:18:10,629 --> 00:18:13,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't face my parents,</font>

286
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad for my wife,</font>

287
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,829
<font color=#FFFF00>and feel embarrassed to my kids.</font>

288
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

289
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:23,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

290
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:27,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think of running away from home...</font>

291
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:30,999
<font color=#FFFF00>or jumping off the bridge like you did before.</font>

292
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave me alone.</font>

293
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,499
<font color=#FFFF00>My life is so worthless,</font>

294
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,099
<font color=#FFFF00>- isn't it? - Seong Hoon.</font>

295
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:40,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

296
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:42,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I can do it on my own.</font>

297
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so depressed.</font>

298
00:18:46,469 --> 00:18:49,469
<font color=#FFFF00>You've overcome worse things, right?</font>

299
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:51,199
<font color=#FFFF00>When I regain my lawyer license,</font>

300
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:53,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll work harder to make a living.</font>

301
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,129
<font color=#FFFF00>And if you manage the restaurant well,</font>

302
00:18:56,229 --> 00:18:58,259
<font color=#FFFF00>we can stand on our feet again.</font>

303
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,129
<font color=#FFFF00>That's useless.</font>

304
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,499
<font color=#FFFF00>When will we be able...</font>

305
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:06,559
<font color=#FFFF00>reacquire our parents' house?</font>

306
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:13,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

307
00:19:14,469 --> 00:19:16,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying.</font>

308
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:18,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I feel like...</font>

309
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:23,429
<font color=#FFFF00>crying too because you're crying.</font>

310
00:19:25,229 --> 00:19:26,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

311
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:32,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon, put your head up.</font>

312
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:33,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me.</font>

313
00:19:34,469 --> 00:19:36,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are they laughing so loud when we're crying?</font>

314
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>They're such obnoxious wenches.</font>

315
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:48,199
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

316
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:51,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

317
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:53,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at that.</font>

318
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,329
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

319
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:08,159
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk.</font>

320
00:20:08,329 --> 00:20:10,469
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

321
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

322
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,829
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't got our money back yet.</font>

323
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:16,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget about the money.</font>

324
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,469
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me. - Seong Hoon.</font>

325
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. Stop.</font>

326
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:22,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

327
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,259
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Lee. - Seong Hoon.</font>

328
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you drinking here?</font>

329
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:30,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you drinking here?</font>

330
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What bothers you this time?</font>

331
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at me, Mr. Lee.</font>

332
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. You're Seong Joon's brother, Mr. Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

333
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I said stop it.</font>

334
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:43,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off.</font>

335
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

336
00:20:48,469 --> 00:20:51,499
<font color=#FFFF00>how precious that house is...</font>

337
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:53,329
<font color=#FFFF00>to our grandmother and dad?</font>

338
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,529
<font color=#FFFF00>You are Seong Joon's brother.</font>

339
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,529
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

340
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,159
<font color=#FFFF00>ruin...</font>

341
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:02,399
<font color=#FFFF00>our whole family...</font>

342
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,859
<font color=#FFFF00>and even our house?</font>

343
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:06,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon...</font>

344
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is my dad's most precious son.</font>

345
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:15,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how much I cherished our Seong Joon?</font>

346
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think we'd give up on Seong Joon that easily?</font>

347
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,029
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll never...</font>

348
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,469
<font color=#FFFF00>let you take him away from us.</font>

349
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is...</font>

350
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:32,529
<font color=#FFFF00>our brother.</font>

351
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Understood?</font>

352
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- How does it feel now? - Seong Joon.</font>

353
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,029
<font color=#FFFF00>What if he...</font>

354
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,759
<font color=#FFFF00>changes his mind? I told you.</font>

355
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,659
<font color=#FFFF00>He hasn't paid us yet.</font>

356
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of this.</font>

357
00:21:48,229 --> 00:21:49,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

358
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,659
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey, - Let's get out.</font>

359
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:54,729
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop it. - you can have our place.</font>

360
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,829
<font color=#FFFF00>But don't you dare go close to Seng Joon anymore.</font>

361
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:59,399
<font color=#FFFF00>- I said stop it already! - Just take that house...</font>

362
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:02,329
<font color=#FFFF00>- and leave Seong Joon to us. - Hurry up.</font>

363
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,129
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's get out. - My gosh.</font>

364
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Our bill...</font>

365
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,229
<font color=#FFFF00>That guy over there will pay our bill.</font>

366
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:09,829
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me go. - Please get a hold of yourself.</font>

367
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,759
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me. - If we had known he'd come here,</font>

368
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:13,929
<font color=#FFFF00>- we could've ordered more. - Goodness.</font>

369
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,759
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so disturbing.</font>

370
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Where will they move then?</font>

371
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

372
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that you bought that place.</font>

373
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:58,999
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be happy that your dream has come true.</font>

374
00:22:59,499 --> 00:23:02,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Good riddance.</font>

375
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

376
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:14,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay? What's wrong with you?</font>

377
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you drunk?</font>

378
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Be careful.</font>

379
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,259
<font color=#FFFF00>This way.</font>

380
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:27,999
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

381
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:31,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear me.</font>

382
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:36,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you drink so much?</font>

383
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:38,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

384
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:41,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you drank to celebrate the success of your plan.</font>

385
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you were so happy...</font>

386
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,199
<font color=#FFFF00>as you can finally take revenge...</font>

387
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,099
<font color=#FFFF00>and demolish that house.</font>

388
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:53,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter now?</font>

389
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,259
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be happy. What's wrong with you?</font>

390
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

391
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,299
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've been drunk lonely all by yourself.</font>

392
00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:03,529
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no one to celebrate with you.</font>

393
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,659
<font color=#FFFF00>But you know that nobody would be willing to do so.</font>

394
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,029
<font color=#FFFF00>That's exactly why you drank alone though.</font>

395
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, you shouldn't drink this much alone.</font>

396
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:17,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You must drink in moderation.</font>

397
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,429
<font color=#FFFF00>And I hope...</font>

398
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,899
<font color=#FFFF00>we don't run into each other anymore.</font>

399
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,129
<font color=#FFFF00>He told me to leave alone.</font>

400
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:29,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

401
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:35,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd been looking for him for my entire life.</font>

402
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,099
<font color=#FFFF00>And he doesn't want to see me anymore.</font>

403
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:42,959
<font color=#FFFF00>He just wants me to leave.</font>

404
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:47,429
<font color=#FFFF00>He even told me to think he's dead.</font>

405
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,999
<font color=#FFFF00>What have I done wrong?</font>

406
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,659
<font color=#FFFF00>My revenge is nothing compared to what I've gone through.</font>

407
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:01,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they lose their father?</font>

408
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:04,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he lose his children?</font>

409
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:07,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Are they suffering from being forcibly separated from each other?</font>

410
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:11,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't forgotten about Sang Woo for an instance.</font>

411
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I finally found him,</font>

412
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,859
<font color=#FFFF00>but I have no memories with him at all.</font>

413
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon and Seong Sik have,</font>

414
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:29,329
<font color=#FFFF00>but I don't have any memories with Sang Woo.</font>

415
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:32,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not.</font>

416
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I said 23 years are a very long time.</font>

417
00:25:35,629 --> 00:25:37,229
<font color=#FFFF00>If that were so simple as you thought...</font>

418
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:39,359
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's them who took my brother away from me!</font>

419
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,999
<font color=#FFFF00>My childhood and youth were lost,</font>

420
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:47,659
<font color=#FFFF00>and I ended up with nothing.</font>

421
00:25:49,459 --> 00:25:50,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm still alone.</font>

422
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:54,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still think...</font>

423
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:58,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I should leave Sang Woo behind?</font>

424
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,899
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't right.</font>

425
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his brother.</font>

426
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:09,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo's brother is me, not Seong Hoon or Seong Sik.</font>

427
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo,</font>

428
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,399
<font color=#FFFF00>you're drunk.</font>

429
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,699
<font color=#FFFF00>What have I got?</font>

430
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't gained anything...</font>

431
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,459
<font color=#FFFF00>from living like this until now.</font>

432
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Hyun Woo.</font>

433
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

434
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh boy.</font>

435
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:03,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Why on earth did things go this way?</font>

436
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

437
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I think the style isn't bad.</font>

438
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:23,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Write a report of the meeting and upload it on the intranet.</font>

439
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:24,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

440
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:27,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Then when should we hold a meeting...</font>

441
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:28,599
<font color=#FFFF00>to discuss the today's agenda?</font>

442
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:31,199
<font color=#FFFF00>- This time tomorrow would be good. - Okay.</font>

443
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:34,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you send the next two episodes to the director?</font>

444
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:36,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I did. By the way,</font>

445
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:39,959
<font color=#FFFF00>are those episodes written by Writer Choi?</font>

446
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

447
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:44,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Both I and the director found it...</font>

448
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:45,629
<font color=#FFFF00>quite...</font>

449
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell me what you're talking about!</font>

450
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:50,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

451
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, she thinks...</font>

452
00:27:53,329 --> 00:27:55,799
<font color=#FFFF00>it's weird that Writer Choi has changed her mind...</font>

453
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,959
<font color=#FFFF00>after she told us she would no longer take part in this.</font>

454
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:02,599
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so sensitive. It's not a big deal at all.</font>

455
00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying the episodes are written by Dong Hui?</font>

456
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,399
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me warn you. - Okay.</font>

457
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure not to talk about Dong Hui ever again...</font>

458
00:28:15,699 --> 00:28:17,159
<font color=#FFFF00>reading the scripts.</font>

459
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Until when do I have to hear...</font>

460
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,429
<font color=#FFFF00>about her who just ran away without a sense of responsibility?</font>

461
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:23,599
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.</font>

462
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:25,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Director Han in there?</font>

463
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

464
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:30,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that? Why is she being so sensitive?</font>

465
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,829
<font color=#FFFF00>That's ridiculous.</font>

466
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:35,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pretty sure the script has...</font>

467
00:28:35,529 --> 00:28:37,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui's style of writing.</font>

468
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:39,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, stop it.</font>

469
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

470
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:44,259
<font color=#FFFF00>You wanted to see me. I was in a meeting.</font>

471
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:48,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Why are you staring at me like that?</font>

472
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come to my house?</font>

473
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I did.</font>

474
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,399
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you heard it from your mother.</font>

475
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to you,</font>

476
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:00,929
<font color=#FFFF00>she took care of the urgent things.</font>

477
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:03,659
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a relief.</font>

478
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I could help.</font>

479
00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:07,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay it back as soon as possible.</font>

480
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:10,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. Why don't you let me help you?</font>

481
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do this to me. I deserve to help you.</font>

482
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother told me what is going on.</font>

483
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,029
<font color=#FFFF00>The money I gave her can't cover the whole thing.</font>

484
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

485
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:22,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, why aren't you trying to take the easy way out?</font>

486
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,599
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here for you.</font>

487
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:28,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been looking at you and waiting for you for long.</font>

488
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:29,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you trying to avoid me?</font>

489
00:29:29,859 --> 00:29:30,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo.</font>

490
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Just get some help from me and marry me.</font>

491
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,759
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only person who can support your family now.</font>

492
00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:40,529
<font color=#FFFF00>All your family is counting on you.</font>

493
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What's holding you back?</font>

494
00:29:42,629 --> 00:29:44,929
<font color=#FFFF00>You said your family is the most precious thing.</font>

495
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:46,299
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing you can't do for your family.</font>

496
00:29:47,229 --> 00:29:48,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Just marry me.</font>

497
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you and your family will be...</font>

498
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you your money back. So stop it.</font>

499
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:58,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How will you give me the money back?</font>

500
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:02,529
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you going to sell yourself to UN Production...</font>

501
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,429
<font color=#FFFF00>who's been offering you a job for the past two years?</font>

502
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:05,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Mi Joo.</font>

503
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,329
<font color=#FFFF00>They are nasty.</font>

504
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:10,399
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that. That's why you've refused their offers.</font>

505
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how much money they offered you.</font>

506
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,329
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you move over to the company,</font>

507
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,959
<font color=#FFFF00>your career will come to a dead end.</font>

508
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,859
<font color=#FFFF00>That's none of your business.</font>

509
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,999
<font color=#FFFF00>You stupid jerk!</font>

510
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

511
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,159
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you are doing? We are at work now.</font>

512
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What's so hard about that?</font>

513
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:40,499
<font color=#FFFF00>What's so special about you?</font>

514
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:45,859
<font color=#FFFF00>And I didn't have the guts...</font>

515
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:48,499
<font color=#FFFF00>to ask you this.</font>

516
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me ask you the question.</font>

517
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What does Dong Hui have that I don't?</font>

518
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me! What does she have that I don't?</font>

519
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,899
<font color=#FFFF00>It's finally happening.</font>

520
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what should we do?</font>

521
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:12,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, this is embarrassing.</font>

522
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:14,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What should we do?</font>

523
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:20,129
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with you?</font>

524
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:23,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Do with it as you please.</font>

525
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you talking about? - And...</font>

526
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:29,199
<font color=#FFFF00>please persuade Seong Joon.</font>

527
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll never give up on him.</font>

528
00:31:32,999 --> 00:31:34,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to marry him.</font>

529
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

530
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:39,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing all this now?</font>

531
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon's family is in trouble now.</font>

532
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,029
<font color=#FFFF00>They'd lose their house and end up on the streets.</font>

533
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:47,099
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad to hear that.</font>

534
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:49,529
<font color=#FFFF00>What an arrogant jerk.</font>

535
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:50,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

536
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:54,199
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll follow your advice...</font>

537
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,029
<font color=#FFFF00>about Dong Hui and Grandmother.</font>

538
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:58,799
<font color=#FFFF00>But please let me have Seong Joon.</font>

539
00:31:59,029 --> 00:32:00,829
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so stupid.</font>

540
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,529
<font color=#FFFF00>He already ditched you once.</font>

541
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's your pride?</font>

542
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you just give up on him?</font>

543
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. I have no pride.</font>

544
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:12,259
<font color=#FFFF00>So please,</font>

545
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:15,259
<font color=#FFFF00>let me have him.</font>

546
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:17,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo, stop it.</font>

547
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:18,899
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no time to waste.</font>

548
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:22,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stop at nothing to have him.</font>

549
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:25,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll never lose him to anyone.</font>

550
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Lose him? What does that mean?</font>

551
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you understood me. I should get going.</font>

552
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:31,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

553
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:35,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

554
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? It's me.</font>

555
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,999
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on with Han Seong Joon?</font>

556
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:50,999
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with Mi Joo?</font>

557
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:55,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch his every movement...</font>

558
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:56,599
<font color=#FFFF00>and report back to me.</font>

559
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:02,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you knock?</font>

560
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:03,699
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my house.</font>

561
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

562
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I handed over the scripts with your name as you insisted.</font>

563
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you like it?</font>

564
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:13,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you talking down to me?</font>

565
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:15,699
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

566
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What if...</font>

567
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm someone you can't treat like that?</font>

568
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:25,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you out of your mind?</font>

569
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:29,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm stuck in the room all day long.</font>

570
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,759
<font color=#FFFF00>So my head fills with various kinds of thoughts.</font>

571
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:34,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you...</font>

572
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:35,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't talk down to me.</font>

573
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:37,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I won't talk down to you.</font>

574
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:43,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you are quite supercilious as you are an only child.</font>

575
00:33:44,129 --> 00:33:46,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairman said...</font>

576
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,559
<font color=#FFFF00>you had a cousin named Hyun Jeong. If you grew up with her,</font>

577
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:51,929
<font color=#FFFF00>would you've been better?</font>

578
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,429
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

579
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,299
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just one of my miscellaneous thoughts.</font>

580
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that I'm stuck here,</font>

581
00:34:01,199 --> 00:34:03,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I think about many things.</font>

582
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:05,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Or whatever.</font>

583
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking nonsense and write the scripts for episode 9 and 10.</font>

584
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:10,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

585
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,299
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

586
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:24,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean so what?</font>

587
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Your brother and sister-in-law are going house hunting.</font>

588
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I can't believe this.</font>

589
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:30,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I've seen...</font>

590
00:34:30,499 --> 00:34:32,869
<font color=#FFFF00>a lot of things that are just unbelievable.</font>

591
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:35,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I'd had enough,</font>

592
00:34:35,829 --> 00:34:37,229
<font color=#FFFF00>but it happened again.</font>

593
00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:41,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, they'd eventually become...</font>

594
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,999
<font color=#FFFF00>recipients of livelihood program.</font>

595
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:45,399
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

596
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you before.</font>

597
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:49,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't devote yourself to your children.</font>

598
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,599
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll end up penniless...</font>

599
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:55,959
<font color=#FFFF00>and become a recipient of livelihood program.</font>

600
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,899
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Watch your mouth.</font>

601
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying this as I'm upset.</font>

602
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:05,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll give you some money.</font>

603
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:07,759
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have money.</font>

604
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:10,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll do it somehow.</font>

605
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,629
<font color=#FFFF00>It is my mother and brother I'm talking about.</font>

606
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't ignore it.</font>

607
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,759
<font color=#FFFF00>That'd be very helpful.</font>

608
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:19,699
<font color=#FFFF00>But you've lived alone all your life.</font>

609
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:22,529
<font color=#FFFF00>You should at least have some money in the late period of your life.</font>

610
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:24,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

611
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:27,399
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, he doesn't show up anymore, does he?</font>

612
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,829
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

613
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

614
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure, Mom. He doesn't.</font>

615
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:36,399
<font color=#FFFF00>If you ever see him again...</font>

616
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:39,429
<font color=#FFFF00>or live with him behind my back,</font>

617
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be sitting still, okay?</font>

618
00:35:41,429 --> 00:35:44,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, why would I live with him?</font>

619
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>- I should go. - Mom.</font>

620
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:48,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you leaving so early? Have dinner with me.</font>

621
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:50,029
<font color=#FFFF00>We have a family meeting.</font>

622
00:35:50,259 --> 00:35:53,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, take care. Don't worry about it.</font>

623
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you startled me.</font>

624
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:05,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

625
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get in?</font>

626
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:10,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother left the door open.</font>

627
00:36:11,029 --> 00:36:12,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet my mother?</font>

628
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,099
<font color=#FFFF00>I was hiding under the emergency stairs.</font>

629
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you out of your mind?</font>

630
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:21,429
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here? I told you not to come.</font>

631
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:23,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't come again.</font>

632
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,229
<font color=#FFFF00>This is for you.</font>

633
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:29,929
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

634
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:31,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it from Jeong Eun.</font>

635
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:33,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mother is moving out.</font>

636
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would she tell you that?</font>

637
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Use it for her new house.</font>

638
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:40,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you give me that money?</font>

639
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:44,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not her son-in-law,</font>

640
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,129
<font color=#FFFF00>and I'm not your husband.</font>

641
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,729
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm Jeong Eun's father.</font>

642
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:52,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I've saved some money...</font>

643
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:54,869
<font color=#FFFF00>from my opera pay.</font>

644
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,029
<font color=#FFFF00>And I sold my apartment in Seoul.</font>

645
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Use this money to get a new house.</font>

646
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:05,099
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'll never come back here again.</font>

647
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:08,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri.</font>

648
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:10,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Take care.</font>

649
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:15,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I was very happy to see you again.</font>

650
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:18,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get going.</font>

651
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Myung Jin.</font>

652
00:37:23,129 --> 00:37:24,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Myung Jin!</font>

653
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what was that?</font>

654
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he doing this?</font>

655
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:37,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

656
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:39,199
<font color=#FFFF00>You're home.</font>

657
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you find a new house?</font>

658
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>The rental fees are too high, so it's not easy.</font>

659
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,299
<font color=#FFFF00>We should keep looking.</font>

660
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,959
<font color=#FFFF00>House prices have gone up so high.</font>

661
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,999
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't moved for a long time,</font>

662
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:53,799
<font color=#FFFF00>so I didn't know it was so bad.</font>

663
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:57,869
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't get a two bedroom house with what we have now.</font>

664
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,159
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - What?</font>

665
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

666
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Are Hyung Seop and Jeong Ae home yet?</font>

667
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:07,099
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - We're here.</font>

668
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you find anything good?</font>

669
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, it's not easy.</font>

670
00:38:10,959 --> 00:38:13,199
<font color=#FFFF00>House prices have gone up a lot lately.</font>

671
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:15,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Is that right?</font>

672
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:25,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

673
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,529
<font color=#FFFF00>here.</font>

674
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,329
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the deposit we got back for our apartment.</font>

675
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:35,729
<font color=#FFFF00>We spent some...</font>

676
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:38,829
<font color=#FFFF00>on the fine...</font>

677
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,999
<font color=#FFFF00>and on some other things.</font>

678
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,799
<font color=#FFFF00>But we'll give you all the rest.</font>

679
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to mention about the fine.</font>

680
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:47,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Is paying a fine something to brag about?</font>

681
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,229
<font color=#FFFF00>No. All right.</font>

682
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't...</font>

683
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:54,869
<font color=#FFFF00>talk about it again.</font>

684
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I have this one.</font>

685
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,959
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the diamond ring James gave me.</font>

686
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:04,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Good thing I bore the embarrassment and kept it on.</font>

687
00:39:05,799 --> 00:39:07,399
<font color=#FFFF00>It's going to worth good money.</font>

688
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:09,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll contribute it to the house.</font>

689
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,369
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Hwa. - What?</font>

690
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:15,369
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do with your clothes,</font>

691
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:17,529
<font color=#FFFF00>bag, and shoes you brought from the US?</font>

692
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:21,759
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - We got no space for that anyway.</font>

693
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,999
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you trying to say?</font>

694
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I sold all your brother's clothes.</font>

695
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:30,399
<font color=#FFFF00>The nightclub waiters loved his clothes.</font>

696
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:33,499
<font color=#FFFF00>So I thought about your clothes.</font>

697
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:34,959
<font color=#FFFF00>We can sell your designer bags by auction,</font>

698
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,329
<font color=#FFFF00>and we can sell your clothes...</font>

699
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:39,459
<font color=#FFFF00>in secondhand stores in Itaewon.</font>

700
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,599
<font color=#FFFF00>They would buy them at a good price.</font>

701
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

702
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

703
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:49,159
<font color=#FFFF00>We have nothing to give.</font>

704
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo's salary is getting seized every month...</font>

705
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:56,459
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay back the debts I incurred from the last business.</font>

706
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,199
<font color=#FFFF00>You are...</font>

707
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,799
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable, Seong Hoon.</font>

708
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:07,559
<font color=#FFFF00>If I can, I want to sell my organs.</font>

709
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,759
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon! - Seong Hoon!</font>

710
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:11,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You idiot.</font>

711
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it appropriate thing to say in front of your parents?</font>

712
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:15,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you watch your mouth?</font>

713
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:16,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

714
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:22,459
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just that I am very sorry to all of you.</font>

715
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,659
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

716
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:26,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Your organs are useless anyway.</font>

717
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,599
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother. - I am just really upset.</font>

718
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,559
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Okay.</font>

719
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:36,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, thank you...</font>

720
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:38,399
<font color=#FFFF00>for your contribution.</font>

721
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:45,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon gave me this.</font>

722
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Also,</font>

723
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:50,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon paid back Seong Hoon's debts.</font>

724
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,829
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Did Seong Joon really do that?</font>

725
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

726
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...</font>

727
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,559
<font color=#FFFF00>end up accepting that money?</font>

728
00:40:58,629 --> 00:41:02,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I did. You might blame me, but I couldn't help it.</font>

729
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,229
<font color=#FFFF00>It's an emergency situation.</font>

730
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:07,099
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to unite to get through this.</font>

731
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:08,899
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable.</font>

732
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:11,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if we scrape up every penny we have,</font>

733
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,759
<font color=#FFFF00>we can't even rent a three bedroom house.</font>

734
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,799
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't be picky right now.</font>

735
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:17,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

736
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,399
<font color=#FFFF00>from now on,</font>

737
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:23,369
<font color=#FFFF00>you have to tighten your belt.</font>

738
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep that in mind and come to your senses.</font>

739
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,259
<font color=#FFFF00>And you, Seong Hoon.</font>

740
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom.</font>

741
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't think about making money.</font>

742
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Just stay home.</font>

743
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,799
<font color=#FFFF00>That's helping the family. Do you understand?</font>

744
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I understand.</font>

745
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:43,099
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, where did your wife go again?</font>

746
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:45,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

747
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:49,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Other hospitals give you medical certificates like this.</font>

748
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:52,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you refusing to give me Ji Hoon's medical certificate?</font>

749
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,799
<font color=#FFFF00>You're Chang Soo's mom. No, I mean Ji Hoon's mom.</font>

750
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I am his mother.</font>

751
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:02,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to know why my son is taking this medication.</font>

752
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:06,369
<font color=#FFFF00>Show me Ji Hoon's medical record and...</font>

753
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:08,499
<font color=#FFFF00>the medical certificates from the past one year.</font>

754
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:10,899
<font color=#FFFF00>The medical record...</font>

755
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,369
<font color=#FFFF00>can only be viewed by the patient himself.</font>

756
00:42:13,399 --> 00:42:15,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't I see them?</font>

757
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:18,529
<font color=#FFFF00>My son got treated here because he wasn't well.</font>

758
00:42:18,529 --> 00:42:20,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't his parent see his record?</font>

759
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you should at least give me the medical certificate.</font>

760
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Kang told me to pay extra attention.</font>

761
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Pay extra attention to what?</font>

762
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:30,959
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my son, not his!</font>

763
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Is Dr. Kang back?</font>

764
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:37,629
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Is Dr. Kang back?</font>

765
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:43,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, it's an emergency.</font>

766
00:42:43,229 --> 00:42:46,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon's mom, I mean Chang Soo's mom's here.</font>

767
00:42:46,329 --> 00:42:49,499
<font color=#FFFF00>She keeps asking for Ji Hoon's medical record.</font>

768
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,899
<font color=#FFFF00>She must've seen his record the other time.</font>

769
00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:56,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Ms. Park showed it to her because I wasn't here.</font>

770
00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:00,869
<font color=#FFFF00>Even then, she kept asking why his blood type was different.</font>

771
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:03,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What do we do?</font>

772
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,499
<font color=#FFFF00>What if she knows something?</font>

773
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Regretting it now won't change anything, will it?</font>

774
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:15,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Still,</font>

775
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:17,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too scared, Doctor.</font>

776
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:21,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What if they find out that we swapped the kids?</font>

777
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

778
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:27,399
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take full responsibility.</font>

779
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:34,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no.</font>

780
00:43:43,399 --> 00:43:44,899
<font color=#FFFF00>What does she mean?</font>

781
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What does she mean you swapped the kids?</font>

782
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it wrong, didn't I?</font>

783
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:01,299
<font color=#FFFF00>I just...</font>

784
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:05,729
<font color=#FFFF00>came here to see you...</font>

785
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,899
<font color=#FFFF00>because of this medication Ji Hoon's taking.</font>

786
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,599
<font color=#FFFF00>I came the other day,</font>

787
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:13,629
<font color=#FFFF00>but you weren't here.</font>

788
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:16,999
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

789
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,299
<font color=#FFFF00>what does she mean...</font>

790
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,559
<font color=#FFFF00>that you swapped the kids?</font>

791
00:44:22,799 --> 00:44:24,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor.</font>

792
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Doctor, what on earth are you planning?</font>

793
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:33,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Huh?</font>

794
00:44:40,829 --> 00:44:41,829
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

795
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:48,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Are you serious?</font>

796
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:51,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

797
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:54,799
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

798
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:56,999
<font color=#FFFF00>How can such thing happen?</font>

799
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:58,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so sorry.</font>

800
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:01,959
<font color=#FFFF00>But at the time,</font>

801
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:05,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon was in a very critical condition.</font>

802
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, what are you doing?</font>

803
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:09,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

804
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:10,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Come down!</font>

805
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:12,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon!</font>

806
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:16,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle.</font>

807
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:19,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to live.</font>

808
00:45:19,959 --> 00:45:22,199
<font color=#FFFF00>I will...</font>

809
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,859
<font color=#FFFF00>stop your mom.</font>

810
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:26,959
<font color=#FFFF00>So please come down.</font>

811
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,029
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all useless.</font>

812
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom's going to kill me.</font>

813
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,399
<font color=#FFFF00>It's better to kill myself than to get caught by Mom...</font>

814
00:45:32,959 --> 00:45:34,929
<font color=#FFFF00>and die while studying.</font>

815
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:39,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why...</font>

816
00:45:41,299 --> 00:45:44,459
<font color=#FFFF00>you told Ji Hoon that you will swap the moms?</font>

817
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:45,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

818
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:49,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no other choice.</font>

819
00:45:49,729 --> 00:45:51,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to save Ji Hoon.</font>

820
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:56,729
<font color=#FFFF00>But you can't do this.</font>

821
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,899
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't do this.</font>

822
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down.</font>

823
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,959
<font color=#FFFF00>And please let me finish.</font>

824
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,929
<font color=#FFFF00>How am I supposed to stay calm?</font>

825
00:46:12,229 --> 00:46:15,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you plan such a thing?</font>

826
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:18,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

827
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

828
00:46:26,029 --> 00:46:27,729
<font color=#FFFF00>how painful it was...</font>

829
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:31,629
<font color=#FFFF00>to endure that time?</font>

830
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,959
<font color=#FFFF00>It was the same for me.</font>

831
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:37,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I was sorry to Chang Soo,</font>

832
00:46:37,399 --> 00:46:39,559
<font color=#FFFF00>and I was sorry to Chang Soo's parents.</font>

833
00:46:40,629 --> 00:46:41,629
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

834
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:45,199
<font color=#FFFF00>think about why I had to take this extreme measure.</font>

835
00:46:45,659 --> 00:46:46,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You know.</font>

836
00:46:46,859 --> 00:46:48,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You know my sister Hee Sook.</font>

837
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:52,099
<font color=#FFFF00>If Ji Hoon didn't get to escape her,</font>

838
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:55,129
<font color=#FFFF00>something bad would've happened.</font>

839
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:56,899
<font color=#FFFF00>So please, Hye Joo...</font>

840
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:00,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to hear it.</font>

841
00:47:02,759 --> 00:47:05,259
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

842
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:08,999
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you play with a family relationship?</font>

843
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:12,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it okay for a doctor to do that?</font>

844
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:15,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I will accept any punishment.</font>

845
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,229
<font color=#FFFF00>As his uncle...</font>

846
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:22,759
<font color=#FFFF00>As someone who's been watching him for years,</font>

847
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:24,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought...</font>

848
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,029
<font color=#FFFF00>it would be better for me to go to jail...</font>

849
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,159
<font color=#FFFF00>than to see something bad happening to him.</font>

850
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:33,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted...</font>

851
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,359
<font color=#FFFF00>to protect Ji Hoon...</font>

852
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,429
<font color=#FFFF00>no matter what.</font>

853
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,499
<font color=#FFFF00>How about Chang Soo then?</font>

854
00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:44,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it okay to disregard Chang Soo then?</font>

855
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:47,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Chang Soo someone...</font>

856
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:51,929
<font color=#FFFF00>who can be raised by any family?</font>

857
00:47:57,099 --> 00:47:58,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

858
00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:00,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

859
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo...</font>

860
00:48:06,629 --> 00:48:10,159
<font color=#FFFF00>is a pitiful and sensitive boy too. Do you know that?</font>

861
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, that's... That is...</font>

862
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:18,629
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable.</font>

863
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sincerely sorry.</font>

864
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:24,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no excuses.</font>

865
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:30,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I will...</font>

866
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:34,429
<font color=#FFFF00>report you to the police.</font>

867
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,599
<font color=#FFFF00>Just know that.</font>

868
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm about to lose my mind.</font>

869
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:14,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

870
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:17,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. That little...</font>

871
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt. Aunt.</font>

872
00:49:30,229 --> 00:49:31,329
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk.</font>

873
00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:33,899
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

874
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,199
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you deceive us completely?</font>

875
00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:40,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You are smart.</font>

876
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:42,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you studied? To deceive us?</font>

877
00:49:43,699 --> 00:49:44,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

878
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:47,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care if you are sorry or not.</font>

879
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,799
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you and your uncle plot something like this?</font>

880
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:54,029
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't do anything wrong.</font>

881
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,029
<font color=#FFFF00>It happened because I asked him to.</font>

882
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

883
00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:04,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How can a boy like you come up with a monstrous plan like this?</font>

884
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,399
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you play with fate?</font>

885
00:50:08,099 --> 00:50:09,099
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you?</font>

886
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:12,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know the calamity you will cause for our family with this?</font>

887
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:16,199
<font color=#FFFF00>The same applies for your uncle.</font>

888
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,729
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he go with the plan just because you asked?</font>

889
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:20,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going...</font>

890
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:24,859
<font color=#FFFF00>to report your uncle to the police first. Do you know that?</font>

891
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I did it because Mom made me suffer so much.</font>

892
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to get out of her clutches.</font>

893
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you wanted that badly,</font>

894
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:39,999
<font color=#FFFF00>this wasn't the right way.</font>

895
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,529
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be.</font>

896
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:44,799
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

897
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,399
<font color=#FFFF00>You tricked grown ups...</font>

898
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,199
<font color=#FFFF00>and your parents.</font>

899
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:02,029
<font color=#FFFF00>How? When your mom finds out,</font>

900
00:51:03,459 --> 00:51:05,499
<font color=#FFFF00>this will ruin her completely.</font>

901
00:51:06,499 --> 00:51:08,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you guess how great of a shock it will be for her?</font>

902
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:14,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, your mother...</font>

903
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:16,859
<font color=#FFFF00>did raise you thus far.</font>

904
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:21,399
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever happens, your mother...</font>

905
00:51:22,859 --> 00:51:25,599
<font color=#FFFF00>put a lot of efforts to raised you.</font>

906
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:27,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

907
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:30,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how competent your mother was at work?</font>

908
00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:34,559
<font color=#FFFF00>If she worked instead of raising you,</font>

909
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:38,459
<font color=#FFFF00>she would have been more successful than I am now.</font>

910
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:40,599
<font color=#FFFF00>However,</font>

911
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,229
<font color=#FFFF00>she gave up her career...</font>

912
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:44,929
<font color=#FFFF00>to raise you.</font>

913
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:47,259
<font color=#FFFF00>But how could a son of her...</font>

914
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:50,159
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you lie like this?</font>

915
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:54,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I still hate my mom.</font>

916
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:56,359
<font color=#FFFF00>When I am with her,</font>

917
00:51:57,029 --> 00:51:59,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't breathe.</font>

918
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:02,329
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't accept her still.</font>

919
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

920
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:07,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you turn a blind eye to this just this once?</font>

921
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:09,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

922
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:12,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me this once. Please?</font>

923
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:16,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't kid yourself.</font>

924
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,299
<font color=#FFFF00>We can no longer live like this.</font>

925
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,929
<font color=#FFFF00>This is absurd.</font>

926
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:24,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to go and tell the family...</font>

927
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:26,659
<font color=#FFFF00>and your mother the truth.</font>

928
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:28,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking and follow me.</font>

929
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:29,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

930
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:31,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you coming?</font>

931
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:34,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

932
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:37,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

933
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:39,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going...</font>

934
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:41,459
<font color=#FFFF00>to learn this song next?</font>

935
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom.</font>

936
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:47,599
<font color=#FFFF00>- Aunt. - Let go of me.</font>

937
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,329
<font color=#FFFF00>This is such a nice song.</font>

938
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:53,229
<font color=#FFFF00>It's from "La Traviata" by Verdi.</font>

939
00:52:53,529 --> 00:52:56,029
<font color=#FFFF00>The heroine, Violetta.</font>

940
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,959
<font color=#FFFF00>An innocent farm boy, Alfredo.</font>

941
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:05,829
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the song they exchanged when they first met.</font>

942
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:07,929
<font color=#FFFF00>In this song, a spark of love...</font>

943
00:53:08,499 --> 00:53:09,829
<font color=#FFFF00>starts to flicker.</font>

944
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:15,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you will be singing...</font>

945
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:17,329
<font color=#FFFF00>this world renowned song of tenors.</font>

946
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:19,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I am very happy.</font>

947
00:53:20,299 --> 00:53:22,559
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all thanks to you, Mom.</font>

948
00:53:27,229 --> 00:53:28,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you move aside?</font>

949
00:53:28,929 --> 00:53:30,399
<font color=#FFFF00>You are in our way. We're dancing.</font>

950
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,159
<font color=#FFFF00>What? We are in your way?</font>

951
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:36,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Can you move aside too?</font>

952
00:53:36,759 --> 00:53:38,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm dancing with my Chang Soo.</font>

953
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:40,099
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

954
00:53:40,829 --> 00:53:42,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

955
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:44,699
<font color=#FFFF00>You are a great son.</font>

956
00:53:45,229 --> 00:53:46,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

957
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:49,029
<font color=#FFFF00>very happy that you are my son.</font>

958
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:53,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I am happy and honored that I have you as my mom too.</font>

959
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:56,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I will remain as your son forever.</font>

960
00:54:00,399 --> 00:54:01,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

961
00:54:02,529 --> 00:54:04,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't let our family problems dishearten you.</font>

962
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:07,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's focus on your singing.</font>

963
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:11,099
<font color=#FFFF00>By all means, your mother...</font>

964
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:13,629
<font color=#FFFF00>will raise you as the world renowned opera singer.</font>

965
00:54:14,899 --> 00:54:16,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom. Don't you worry about that.</font>

966
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:24,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't, Aunt.</font>

967
00:54:42,499 --> 00:54:44,729
<font color=#FFFF00>They seem very happy.</font>

968
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:47,029
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

969
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,799
<font color=#FFFF00>can't we be happy too?</font>

970
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:53,029
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

971
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:09,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

972
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:11,359
<font color=#FFFF00>("In Love at Twilight")</font>

973
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

974
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:15,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

975
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my.</font>

976
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:22,099
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is this?</font>

977
00:55:22,429 --> 00:55:24,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. Long time no see.</font>

978
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:27,359
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

979
00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:29,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I have been well of course.</font>

980
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:32,659
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, it's so hard to see you nowadays.</font>

981
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,229
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been dodging my phone calls too.</font>

982
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,959
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that we waited for a long time.</font>

983
00:55:43,029 --> 00:55:46,529
<font color=#FFFF00>We will give you a handsome amount of transfer fee.</font>

984
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:49,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you stay at a ridiculous company like FGC?</font>

985
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,629
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't even support producing dramas.</font>

986
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:55,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to talk about that.</font>

987
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:56,829
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

988
00:55:57,499 --> 00:55:59,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. You're hard to please.</font>

989
00:56:00,459 --> 00:56:02,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I would like to finish...</font>

990
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:04,359
<font color=#FFFF00>this drama perfectly and resign.</font>

991
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

992
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:09,359
<font color=#FFFF00>It will help us too if you do.</font>

993
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:11,659
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

994
00:56:13,429 --> 00:56:16,029
<font color=#FFFF00>how many scriptwriters can you bring with you?</font>

995
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,899
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon? - We have...</font>

996
00:56:17,899 --> 00:56:20,029
<font color=#FFFF00>some decent actors.</font>

997
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:24,229
<font color=#FFFF00>We need scriptwriters for us to produce dramas.</font>

998
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:28,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have some talented writers?</font>

999
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Or are they still under contract with other agencies?</font>

1000
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

1001
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I just work hard by myself.</font>

1002
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:39,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I am close to a lot of scriptwriters,</font>

1003
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,899
<font color=#FFFF00>but I don't have anyone to bring with me.</font>

1004
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,559
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. I got it.</font>

1005
00:56:47,859 --> 00:56:49,929
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how it all starts.</font>

1006
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:52,859
<font color=#FFFF00>It starts from friendship. Anyway, I understand.</font>

1007
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:56,929
<font color=#FFFF00>First, let's sign the contract first.</font>

1008
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

1009
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:03,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring me the contract for Director Han.</font>

1010
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:09,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

1011
00:57:14,229 --> 00:57:17,229
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll provide the best treatment and competitive salary in this industry.</font>

1012
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:20,199
<font color=#FFFF00>We will send you the signing bonus within a week.</font>

1013
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,429
<font color=#FFFF00>(Han Seong Joon)</font>

1014
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:33,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

1015
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really not going to leave with Hyun Woo?</font>

1016
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,529
<font color=#FFFF00>- No. - That's not right, Seong Joon.</font>

1017
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:43,729
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Eun. - I know.</font>

1018
00:57:43,959 --> 00:57:47,099
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how much you care about your family,</font>

1019
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:49,659
<font color=#FFFF00>but Hyun Woo is your brother too.</font>

1020
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:52,229
<font color=#FFFF00>He's your biological brother who has been looking for you for years.</font>

1021
00:57:52,229 --> 00:57:54,029
<font color=#FFFF00>If you abandon him like this...</font>

1022
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:55,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't abandon him.</font>

1023
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:58,729
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason why I can't understand my brother...</font>

1024
00:57:58,759 --> 00:58:00,499
<font color=#FFFF00>is because I don't know if he had to go this far.</font>

1025
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You know in what condition our family is because of what he did.</font>

1026
00:58:07,299 --> 00:58:11,359
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because all he had in his life were wounds.</font>

1027
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,629
<font color=#FFFF00>You received a lot of love without getting hurt too much.</font>

1028
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,999
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you should take care of him.</font>

1029
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:21,699
<font color=#FFFF00>If you abandon him, he'll be all alone.</font>

1030
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:24,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Then everything will be irreversible.</font>

1031
00:58:24,659 --> 00:58:26,329
<font color=#FFFF00>He had enough chances.</font>

1032
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:29,129
<font color=#FFFF00>He could've stopped so many times.</font>

1033
00:58:30,759 --> 00:58:32,699
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's him who ignored all the chances.</font>

1034
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:35,329
<font color=#FFFF00>That might've been his best.</font>

1035
00:58:35,399 --> 00:58:37,829
<font color=#FFFF00>No. He chose a wrong way.</font>

1036
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:40,799
<font color=#FFFF00>It may have been...</font>

1037
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:44,999
<font color=#FFFF00>better if we hadn't met in the first place.</font>

1038
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,799
<font color=#FFFF00>For me,</font>

1039
00:58:48,599 --> 00:58:50,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like he ruined everything in my life.</font>

1040
00:58:50,759 --> 00:58:51,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon,</font>

1041
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:53,729
<font color=#FFFF00>don't say that.</font>

1042
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:56,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give Hyun Woo another chance.</font>

1043
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:01,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I'm leaving.</font>

1044
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:05,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

1045
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:14,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

1046
00:59:14,459 --> 00:59:16,799
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's not far from here. - Okay.</font>

1047
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:18,229
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the address, right?</font>

1048
00:59:18,259 --> 00:59:19,529
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, I do. - Okay.</font>

1049
00:59:29,759 --> 00:59:31,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is waiting in the house?</font>

1050
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:33,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon is.</font>

1051
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Will we get there on foot?</font>

1052
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:36,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Grandmother.</font>

1053
00:59:37,229 --> 00:59:39,499
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't take our car there.</font>

1054
00:59:39,529 --> 00:59:41,659
<font color=#FFFF00>The alley there is too narrow to park the car.</font>

1055
00:59:41,899 --> 00:59:43,199
<font color=#FFFF00>We will have to park...</font>

1056
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:45,559
<font color=#FFFF00>our car in the public parking lots.</font>

1057
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,259
<font color=#FFFF00>That will be so inconvenient!</font>

1058
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:50,799
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. Shoot.</font>

1059
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:53,759
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't even want to pass by his house,</font>

1060
00:59:53,759 --> 00:59:56,359
<font color=#FFFF00>- but I'll have to. - This is awful.</font>

1061
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:58,499
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Ye Bin.</font>

1062
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get going, Mom.</font>

1063
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Chang Soo and Ji Hoon?</font>

1064
01:00:03,259 --> 01:00:05,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, we're here. Hurry up.</font>

1065
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:07,499
<font color=#FFFF00>What are those you're holding?</font>

1066
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:11,029
<font color=#FFFF00>These are the music scores for Chang Soo.</font>

1067
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:13,229
<font color=#FFFF00>We'll carry these ourselves.</font>

1068
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:16,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want them to be lost or ripped while moving.</font>

1069
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so late?</font>

1070
01:00:21,999 --> 01:00:24,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. We forgot something.</font>

1071
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:27,299
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no time to waste. Hurry.</font>

1072
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:32,499
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ji Hoon. - Yes?</font>

1073
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:34,199
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

1074
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,259
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a magic box.</font>

1075
01:00:37,399 --> 01:00:39,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to bring it with you?</font>

1076
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:43,129
<font color=#FFFF00>- Darn it. - Ji Hoon!</font>

1077
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:44,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with him? - Hee Sook.</font>

1078
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:45,959
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom. - Yes?</font>

1079
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:48,899
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes? - That cauldron embarrasses me.</font>

1080
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:51,899
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Please keep a distance from us.</font>

1081
01:00:51,929 --> 01:00:54,459
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say? - Guys, let's just hurry up!</font>

1082
01:00:54,899 --> 01:00:56,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Let's get going.</font>

1083
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,699
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - Grandmother.</font>

1084
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:00,559
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. - Let's go.</font>

1085
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:02,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get moving.</font>

1086
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:05,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, be careful!</font>

1087
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:07,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Hurry up.</font>

1088
01:01:07,659 --> 01:01:10,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik, why are you not carrying anything?</font>

1089
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:12,899
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I have a heavy heart.</font>

1090
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:20,299
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir. - Bulldoze that house.</font>

1091
01:01:21,399 --> 01:01:22,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

1092
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Demolish it as soon as possible.</font>

1093
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

1094
01:01:46,429 --> 01:01:47,599
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

1095
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:49,629
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been, Ms. Oh?</font>

1096
01:01:49,899 --> 01:01:51,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been doing well.</font>

1097
01:01:52,659 --> 01:01:55,699
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to call you over all of a sudden.</font>

1098
01:01:56,029 --> 01:01:57,829
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right. Don't mention it.</font>

1099
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:11,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh,</font>

1100
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,799
<font color=#FFFF00>what happened between me and Dong Hui is all my fault.</font>

1101
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:19,099
<font color=#FFFF00>It was me who recklessly started liking her first.</font>

1102
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,399
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize.</font>

1103
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:27,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I'd like to ask you...</font>

1104
01:02:28,399 --> 01:02:30,529
<font color=#FFFF00>a favor regarding Dong Hui.</font>

1105
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:36,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is locked up...</font>

1106
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:39,329
<font color=#FFFF00>in Chairman Bang's house now.</font>

1107
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:41,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

1108
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:02,959
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1109
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Who in the world doesn't love her children?</font>

1110
01:03:05,899 --> 01:03:07,859
<font color=#FFFF00>If you really love me,</font>

1111
01:03:07,959 --> 01:03:10,499
<font color=#FFFF00>don't you have to try to understand what I really want?</font>

1112
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving. Cherish the memories here by yourself.</font>

1113
01:03:13,199 --> 01:03:14,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Mister.</font>

1114
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:17,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, what brings you here?</font>

1115
01:03:18,229 --> 01:03:19,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Can't I come here?</font>

1116
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:22,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Who am I?</font>

1117
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:25,199
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, please wait a little longer.</font>

1118
01:03:25,429 --> 01:03:26,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>
