92

<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

94

95

<font color="yellow">and the other an attorney office.</font>

96

97

98

99
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:39,456

100
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:43,826
<font color="yellow">Is she still ill-tempered?</font>

101
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:45,696
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

102
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:47,856
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

103
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:52,126
<font color="yellow">I am so sorry, Mother.</font>

104

108
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:02,056
<font color="yellow">You lose your mind...</font>

109

<font color="yellow">whenever the kids are in trouble.</font>

110

111
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:09,156

112
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,696

116
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,326
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

117
00:08:33,296 --> 00:08:35,256
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

118
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,856
<font color="yellow">these are beans for Chang Soo.</font>

119
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:41,096
<font color="yellow">This is for Ji Hoon.</font>

120
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:44,296
<font color="yellow">This is an organic milk for the children.</font>

121
00:08:44,296 --> 00:08:46,626
<font color="yellow">And I'll make salad with these for them.</font>

122
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:49,796
<font color="yellow">Why do you buy only organic ingredients?</font>

123
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:51,696
<font color="yellow">They're too expensive.</font>

124
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:53,526
<font color="yellow">Just buy cheap ones.</font>

125
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,466
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

126
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,996
<font color="yellow">Organic foods aren't so expensive these days.</font>

127
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:04,796
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Mother.</font>

128
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,026
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

129
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:08,296
<font color="yellow">It's 110 dollars.</font>

130
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:12,226
<font color="yellow">Although I don't buy much, it easily exceeds 100 dollars.</font>

131
00:09:13,326 --> 00:09:15,026
<font color="yellow">Pay for yours.</font>

132
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,356
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

133
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:25,626
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

134
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,126
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

135
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,466
<font color="yellow">- This can't be right. - What's wrong?</font>

136
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:31,756
<font color="yellow">Mother, I forgot...</font>

137
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,396
<font color="yellow">to bring my wallet.</font>

138
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:36,126
<font color="yellow">This is bad.</font>

139
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,556
<font color="yellow">Mother, I am sorry,</font>

140
00:09:42,356 --> 00:09:45,596
<font color="yellow">but can you pay for mine, please?</font>

141
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:49,596
<font color="yellow">I pay for yours?</font>

142
00:09:49,596 --> 00:09:50,596
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

143
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,726
<font color="yellow">I will pay you back at home.</font>

144
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:57,056
<font color="yellow">When will you pay for these?</font>

145
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,826
<font color="yellow">- Please, Mother. - I'm sorry.</font>

146

00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:03,466
<font color="yellow">I will pay.</font>

148
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:06,056
<font color="yellow">I'll pay with this card.</font>

149
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,496
<font color="yellow">Where should I put the toilet papers?</font>

150
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,656
<font color="yellow">Just leave them there. I'll put them in the bathroom.</font>

151
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:20,026
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

152
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:21,396
<font color="yellow">Should I put these...</font>

153
00:10:21,726 --> 00:10:23,596
<font color="yellow">- in the kitchen? - Yes.</font>

154
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:26,056
<font color="yellow">Mother, let me take that, too.</font>

155
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,356
<font color="yellow">Are you organizing the fridge?</font>

156
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:44,926
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother. It's done.</font>

157
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:47,326
<font color="yellow">Thank you. You can leave, then.</font>

158
00:10:47,466 --> 00:10:49,726
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Good night. - Goodbye.</font>

00:10:57,796 --> 00:10:58,896
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother?</font>

161
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:00,796
<font color="yellow">I'll go with you.</font>

162
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,526
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I just want to help you.</font>

163
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,726
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Mother. I can carry these by myself.</font>

164
00:11:06,726 --> 00:11:09,396
<font color="yellow">It's too heavy. Let me help you.</font>

165
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:10,956
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

166
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,696
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

167
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,126
<font color="yellow">Mother, you didn't have to do this for me.</font>

168
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:20,796
<font color="yellow">You are almost...</font>

169
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:23,696
<font color="yellow">taking care of both Ji Hoon and Chang Soo.</font>

170
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,296
<font color="yellow">Of course, I should lend you a helping hand.</font>

171
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:27,656
<font color="yellow">Goodness, your fridge is...</font>

172
00:11:27,656 --> 00:11:29,626
<font color="yellow">very neatly organized.</font>

173
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,896
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo needs to learn from you.</font>

174
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,856
<font color="yellow">You know she's busy.</font>

175
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,256
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

176
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:43,056
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much, Mother.</font>

177
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:44,726
<font color="yellow">You're welcome.</font>

178
00:11:44,726 --> 00:11:47,426
<font color="yellow">I'll go back now.</font>

179
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:49,126
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mother.</font>

180
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,296
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

181
00:11:59,826 --> 00:12:00,956
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

182
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,456
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

183
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,456
<font color="yellow">See you, Mother.</font>

184
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:21,356
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she pay back the money?</font>

185
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,356
<font color="yellow">I even went to her house.</font>

186
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:25,726
<font color="yellow">Wait. How much was it?</font>

187
00:12:26,056 --> 00:12:27,196
<font color="yellow">She bought a lot of stuff.</font>

188
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,756
<font color="yellow">It was 79 dollars.</font>

189
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,426
<font color="yellow">Why on earth doesn't she...</font>

190
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:36,326
<font color="yellow">give me the 79 dollars I paid for her?</font>

191
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:42,556
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

192
00:12:55,696 --> 00:12:58,356
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I didn't know cabbage was so delicious.</font>

193
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,596
<font color="yellow">It's so good.</font>

194
00:13:22,356 --> 00:13:23,396
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri!</font>

195
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:39,956
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri! Ae Ri!</font>

196
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,056
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri!</font>

197
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,596
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri!</font>

198
00:13:52,956 --> 00:13:54,626
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right, Professor? - I am fine.</font>

199
00:14:03,896 --> 00:14:05,356
<font color="yellow">What just happened?</font>

200
00:14:05,956 --> 00:14:07,456
<font color="yellow">Why is he in Korea?</font>

201
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,596
<font color="yellow">Why is he at my school?</font>

202
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:12,096
<font color="yellow">What's happening?</font>

203
00:14:22,626 --> 00:14:25,296
<font color="yellow">I am going back to New York.</font>

204
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:27,756
<font color="yellow">I've found Sang Woo.</font>

205
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:32,956
<font color="yellow">I took care of businesses in Seoul, too.</font>

206
00:14:33,756 --> 00:14:34,926
<font color="yellow">This can't be.</font>

207
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,596
<font color="yellow">You should live with your brother.</font>

208
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:39,026
<font color="yellow">My brother...</font>

209
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:44,096
<font color="yellow">should live as he's been living so far.</font>

210
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:47,426
<font color="yellow">I think it's better for him that way.</font>

211
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,756
<font color="yellow">So I should...</font>

212
00:14:50,396 --> 00:14:52,056
<font color="yellow">return to my place.</font>

213
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:09,396
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

214
00:15:18,726 --> 00:15:22,056
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo went back to New York today.</font>

215
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,926
<font color="yellow">Were you already aware of this, Jeong Eun?</font>

216
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:28,926
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

217
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,056
<font color="yellow">He left today.</font>

218
00:15:32,996 --> 00:15:35,356
<font color="yellow">Did you break up with him?</font>

219
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,356
<font color="yellow">Well. I think that's what happened.</font>

220
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:42,326
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Eun. - But...</font>

221
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:44,896
<font color="yellow">how did you find out?</font>

222
00:15:46,996 --> 00:15:49,826
<font color="yellow">I saw him at a hotel this morning.</font>

223
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:53,396
<font color="yellow">- Why? - He invested...</font>

224
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,756
<font color="yellow">a lot of money in the business I am in charge of.</font>

225
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,296
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

226
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:01,496
<font color="yellow">You knew that he didn't go bankrupt and that he was still...</font>

227
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,056
<font color="yellow">the president of Golden Street, right?</font>

228
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,096
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Jeong Eun.</font>

229
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:10,026
<font color="yellow">He had his reasons. He didn't mean any harm by it.</font>

230
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:15,426
<font color="yellow">He did it in order to find his brother.</font>

231
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,926
<font color="yellow">So did he find his brother?</font>

232
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,656
<font color="yellow">His brother's name was Sang Woo, right?</font>

233
00:16:25,596 --> 00:16:28,226
<font color="yellow">- How would you know that? - So what happened?</font>

234
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,456
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Please tell me.</font>

235
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:35,826
<font color="yellow">As I told you before,</font>

236
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,496
<font color="yellow">he said he found his brother.</font>

237
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:44,756
<font color="yellow">He looked for...</font>

238
00:16:46,126 --> 00:16:48,126
<font color="yellow">his brother for such a long time.</font>

239
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:51,896
<font color="yellow">He had a painful experience...</font>

240
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:53,926
<font color="yellow">and spent a difficult time doing so.</font>

241
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:57,256
<font color="yellow">Even if he did find his brother,</font>

242
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:01,156
<font color="yellow">he said he planned to leave without letting him know.</font>

243
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,256
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

244
00:17:06,256 --> 00:17:09,166
<font color="yellow">He said the family that adopted his brother, looked more...</font>

245
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,456
<font color="yellow">like a real family than himself.</font>

246
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:13,326
<font color="yellow">He said...</font>

247
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:17,096
<font color="yellow">it might be better for him...</font>

248
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:20,226
<font color="yellow">to live as he's been living so far.</font>

249
00:17:22,926 --> 00:17:24,726
<font color="yellow">That's why he left.</font>

250
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,396
<font color="yellow">But why do you ask?</font>

251
00:17:33,756 --> 00:17:35,256
<font color="yellow">It's just that...</font>

252
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:40,256
<font color="yellow">I thought that he knew me from a long time ago.</font>

253
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:42,456
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

254
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,996
<font color="yellow">He knew you from a long time ago?</font>

255
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,356
<font color="yellow">It's just a thought.</font>

256
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:49,256
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

257
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,096
<font color="yellow">Strangely,</font>

258
00:17:51,856 --> 00:17:53,826
<font color="yellow">I keep thinking about him.</font>

259
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,826
<font color="yellow">I remember how he was overly nice to me and my family...</font>

260
00:17:57,856 --> 00:17:59,896
<font color="yellow">and the way he stared at me.</font>

261
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,296
<font color="yellow">Out of the blue, he invested in my business.</font>

262
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,926
<font color="yellow">I can't understand it. I can't connect the dots.</font>

263
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,396
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

264
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:12,926
<font color="yellow">I can't seem to be at ease.</font>

265
00:18:14,796 --> 00:18:16,166
<font color="yellow">Just like I said before,</font>

266
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,896
<font color="yellow">I feel like I knew him from a long time ago.</font>

267
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:21,526
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

268
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:25,896
<font color="yellow">I feel like he knows me better than I know myself.</font>

269
00:18:28,526 --> 00:18:29,856
<font color="yellow">I can't understand this.</font>

270
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:33,926
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

271
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,326
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

272
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:52,356
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

273
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:54,666
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

274
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,856
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to pick up some cash from the street?</font>

275
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:04,126
<font color="yellow">- What? - It looked like you were.</font>

276
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,596
<font color="yellow">You are funny, Seong Hoon. I wasn't trying that.</font>

277
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:10,256
<font color="yellow">I should be the one who's trying to pick up some cash from the street.</font>

278
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:13,356
<font color="yellow">- Are you doing the delivery? - Yes.</font>

279
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:16,896
<font color="yellow">As you can see, I am. Go home and stop trying.</font>

280
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,326
<font color="yellow">Okay. Seong Hoon.</font>

281
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,896
<font color="yellow">Come on. Don't be like that. Please help me.</font>

282
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:24,166
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. I can't help you anymore.</font>

283
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,626
<font color="yellow">Go. Leave now.</font>

284
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:27,596
<font color="yellow">Is this how you are going to play it?</font>

285
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:30,056
<font color="yellow">My neighbors are walking by.</font>

286
00:19:30,456 --> 00:19:31,496
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Father?</font>

287
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:36,256
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - Please help me one more time.</font>

288
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,126
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - My goodness.</font>

289
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:40,556
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

290
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:42,996
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

291
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:44,956
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

292
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:55,626
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You are Seong Joon.</font>

293
00:19:57,556 --> 00:19:59,296
<font color="yellow">I can't recognize you.</font>

294
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,456
<font color="yellow">You grew into a handsome man.</font>

295
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:03,796
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

296
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,896
<font color="yellow">Me? Who am I?</font>

297
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:10,796
<font color="yellow">Don't you know who I am?</font>

298
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,256
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

299
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:17,026
<font color="yellow">- What are you going to tell him? - What's up with you?</font>

300
00:20:17,056 --> 00:20:18,596
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - Goodness.</font>

301
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:20,296
<font color="yellow">- Father. - What's wrong with you?</font>

302
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,926
<font color="yellow">- Go home. - Seong Joon. Seong Joon!</font>

303
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:36,396
<font color="yellow">Please sleep on it and make the right choice for yourself.</font>

304
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:40,296
<font color="yellow">You can submit your resignation letter whenever you want to,</font>

305
00:20:41,356 --> 00:20:42,796
<font color="yellow">but such opportunity would be rare.</font>

306
00:20:43,596 --> 00:20:45,126
<font color="yellow">You'll choose to face the reality...</font>

307
00:20:45,196 --> 00:20:47,826
<font color="yellow">or run away only to keep your pride.</font>

308
00:20:49,126 --> 00:20:51,666
<font color="yellow">It's all up to you.</font>

309
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,796
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

310
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,826
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - Why do you ask?</font>

311
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:06,256
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon can come in, but I can't?</font>

312
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,926
<font color="yellow">So you should've picked up my calls.</font>

313
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:15,096
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You are certainly acting like a writer now.</font>

314
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,856
<font color="yellow">What is your reason of visiting me?</font>

315
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:19,996
<font color="yellow">Please tell me and leave.</font>

316
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,166
<font color="yellow">What is this now?</font>

317
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:29,026
<font color="yellow">Sell your synopsis.</font>

318
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:32,226
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - I will buy your synopsis.</font>

319
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,926
<font color="yellow">Just sell your synopsis and steer clear of my business.</font>

320
00:21:36,196 --> 00:21:39,196
<font color="yellow">- Director Bang. - You got lucky. A director who...</font>

321
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:41,396
<font color="yellow">likes to revise terrible synopses like this, has turned up.</font>

322
00:21:42,226 --> 00:21:44,756
<font color="yellow">The director wants to film "Romance Learned through Books".</font>

323
00:21:45,426 --> 00:21:47,826
<font color="yellow">- Really? - But you are not confident, right?</font>

324
00:21:48,496 --> 00:21:51,056
<font color="yellow">- About what? - You are not confident that...</font>

325
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:54,826
<font color="yellow">you can turn this synopsis into a 16-episode drama. Aren't I right?</font>

326
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,456
<font color="yellow">Just because you were a runner-up at a competition,</font>

327
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:00,656
<font color="yellow">doesn't make you a writer all of a sudden.</font>

328
00:22:02,156 --> 00:22:05,596
<font color="yellow">So what is your point?</font>

329
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,826
<font color="yellow">How many times do I need to tell you?</font>

330
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:11,396
<font color="yellow">Just sell your synopsis and stay out of this. You'll only cause trouble.</font>

331
00:22:11,626 --> 00:22:13,326
<font color="yellow">What if I say I won't?</font>

332
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:17,226
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a better opportunity for you if you sell...</font>

333
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,926
<font color="yellow">your synopsis and witness how your synopsis turns into a drama?</font>

334
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:23,926
<font color="yellow">Who do you think will consider scripts that...</font>

335
00:22:24,156 --> 00:22:26,026
<font color="yellow">are written by a nameless writer?</font>

336
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:29,596
<font color="yellow">Even if that's the case, I won't sell it.</font>

337
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:32,056
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh Dong Hui. Do you not take me seriously?</font>

338
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,996
<font color="yellow">Do you think I came here to play with you?</font>

339
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:37,956
<font color="yellow">Then, Director. Do you plan on playing with my writing?</font>

340
00:22:38,026 --> 00:22:41,196
<font color="yellow">- This is an insult. - My wish to buy it isn't an insult.</font>

341
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:42,556
<font color="yellow">What is it then, if it's not an insult?</font>

342
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:44,996
<font color="yellow">I mean to say I will purchase it fairly by paying you money for it.</font>

343
00:22:45,026 --> 00:22:47,956
<font color="yellow">But I won't sell it. No matter what happens, I won't sell it.</font>

344
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:50,326
<font color="yellow">So please leave.</font>

345
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:02,756
<font color="yellow">All right. I will go.</font>

346
00:23:03,226 --> 00:23:04,826
<font color="yellow">But think carefully.</font>

347
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:08,556
<font color="yellow">Is it better to let your script come into the light?</font>

348
00:23:08,796 --> 00:23:11,396
<font color="yellow">Or is it better to let the result of your hard work...</font>

349
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:14,826
<font color="yellow">rot away to never see the light of day?</font>

350
00:24:02,326 --> 00:24:03,896
<font color="yellow">Why are you drinking when you should be writing?</font>

351
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,426
<font color="yellow">Let me join you.</font>

352
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:21,996
<font color="yellow">Is something not going well?</font>

353
00:24:23,556 --> 00:24:26,726
<font color="yellow">Do I get to slack off only when things are not going well?</font>

354
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:29,126
<font color="yellow">So you were slacking off.</font>

355
00:24:29,596 --> 00:24:30,696
<font color="yellow">I didn't know.</font>

356
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:33,126
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

357
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:36,826
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

358
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:39,726
<font color="yellow">our drama got funded.</font>

359
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:40,996
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

360
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:43,496
<font color="yellow">That's good news. The board was so unhappy...</font>

361
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,456
<font color="yellow">with the Contents Team.</font>

362
00:24:46,756 --> 00:24:49,896
<font color="yellow">But why do you look so depressed?</font>

363
00:24:50,226 --> 00:24:51,696
<font color="yellow">Didn't everything turn out well?</font>

364
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:53,156
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

365
00:24:54,156 --> 00:24:57,396
<font color="yellow">Everything is all muddled up.</font>

366
00:24:58,056 --> 00:24:59,696
<font color="yellow">We got the funding,</font>

367
00:25:00,296 --> 00:25:03,256
<font color="yellow">but the investor worries me.</font>

368
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:06,826
<font color="yellow">What do you mean the investor worries you?</font>

369
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:10,026
<font color="yellow">It's complicated.</font>

370
00:25:11,026 --> 00:25:12,026
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

371
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,456
<font color="yellow">we got the funding,</font>

372
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:16,826
<font color="yellow">but we have neither a screenwriter nor a script.</font>

373
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:18,556
<font color="yellow">Nothing has been decided yet.</font>

374
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:21,526
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

375
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,826
<font color="yellow">what's wrong with you again?</font>

376
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,926
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

377
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,156
<font color="yellow">I have a lot to think about, too.</font>

378
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:34,196
<font color="yellow">So stop worrying and work with me.</font>

379
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:35,556
<font color="yellow">Director Han.</font>

380
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:38,156
<font color="yellow">Don't be afraid. I'm here for you.</font>

381
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,956
<font color="yellow">Still, I don't have the courage.</font>

382
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:44,456
<font color="yellow">I'm a rookie who just wrote one short drama.</font>

383
00:25:44,456 --> 00:25:46,856
<font color="yellow">It's not like I got an excellence award for it.</font>

384
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:48,656
<font color="yellow">It was an honorable mention.</font>

385
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:50,296
<font color="yellow">Do you know what that means?</font>

386
00:25:50,626 --> 00:25:52,826
<font color="yellow">I looked it up in the dictionary.</font>

387
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:54,826
<font color="yellow">It means it's not as good as the winning work,</font>

388
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:57,126
<font color="yellow">but it's a little good. It means it's a little good.</font>

389
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,596
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

390
00:26:00,496 --> 00:26:01,926
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

391
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:04,696
<font color="yellow">Being a little good is enough.</font>

392
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:06,596
<font color="yellow">It could've been really bad.</font>

393
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,996
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I don't have the confidence.</font>

394
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:12,296
<font color="yellow">Let's do it. I'll help you.</font>

395
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:15,096
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not doing it. I don't have the confidence.</font>

396
00:26:15,396 --> 00:26:18,196
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be humiliated...</font>

397
00:26:18,226 --> 00:26:19,456
<font color="yellow">and looked down by the entire nation.</font>

398
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:22,626
<font color="yellow">I might be on the wanted list for not writing well.</font>

399
00:26:24,726 --> 00:26:27,826
<font color="yellow">Everyone will point fingers at me.</font>

400
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,156
<font color="yellow">They won't.</font>

401
00:26:29,456 --> 00:26:31,026
<font color="yellow">You can do well, Dong Hui.</font>

402
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:34,196
<font color="yellow">No. No. I will do bad.</font>

403
00:26:35,896 --> 00:26:37,626
<font color="yellow">You have to do it one day.</font>

404
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,126
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to be a writer?</font>

405
00:26:39,856 --> 00:26:41,726
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

406
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,296
<font color="yellow">I need to do it after about 10 years.</font>

407
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:45,626
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

408
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:48,526
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I won't do it. I won't.</font>

409
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:51,826
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not going to do it. Why do you guys keep pestering me?</font>

410
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:45,096
<font color="yellow">Dad, it's me, Seong Joon.</font>

411
00:27:45,556 --> 00:27:47,726
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

412
00:27:56,496 --> 00:27:57,556
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

413
00:27:58,056 --> 00:28:00,756
<font color="yellow">Dad, is something wrong?</font>

414
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:02,826
<font color="yellow">No. Why do you ask?</font>

415
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,026
<font color="yellow">It's just...</font>

416
00:28:06,656 --> 00:28:08,496
<font color="yellow">Who's the woman...</font>

417
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:12,626
<font color="yellow">you were with a while ago?</font>

418
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,426
<font color="yellow">She knew me, so I was wondering who she was.</font>

419
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:25,826
<font color="yellow">She's...</font>

420
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:30,656
<font color="yellow">She's a former colleague. I knew her from my work.</font>

421
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:33,356
<font color="yellow">So of course she knows you.</font>

422
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:34,696
<font color="yellow">When you were young,</font>

423
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,156
<font color="yellow">I took you with me to work,</font>

424
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:40,996
<font color="yellow">and she saw you there.</font>

425
00:28:50,026 --> 00:28:51,126
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon,</font>

426
00:28:51,926 --> 00:28:53,896
<font color="yellow">why are you looking at me like that?</font>

427
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,896
<font color="yellow">I'm telling the truth.</font>

428
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:59,096
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

429
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:01,696
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

430
00:29:35,496 --> 00:29:37,456
<font color="yellow">Come again.</font>

431
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:41,096
<font color="yellow">Come again.</font>

432
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:44,256
<font color="yellow">When did you come?</font>

433
00:29:44,756 --> 00:29:45,926
<font color="yellow">Just now.</font>

434
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:48,626
<font color="yellow">Why did you come? I can handle it alone.</font>

435
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,126
<font color="yellow">You can go home and rest. You can watch the kids.</font>

436
00:29:53,496 --> 00:29:55,296
<font color="yellow">I don't have any kids to watch.</font>

437
00:29:55,696 --> 00:29:56,696
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

438
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:59,156
<font color="yellow">I lost all my kids.</font>

439
00:29:59,426 --> 00:30:00,626
<font color="yellow">To whom?</font>

440
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:02,256
<font color="yellow">Who do you think?</font>

441
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:05,926
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you for the last time.</font>

442
00:30:06,496 --> 00:30:10,496
<font color="yellow">I decided not to care about our biological relation.</font>

443
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:13,196
<font color="yellow">Once a son, always a son.</font>

444
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:14,596
<font color="yellow">Got it?</font>

445
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,256
<font color="yellow">Remember that.</font>

446
00:30:16,426 --> 00:30:18,456
<font color="yellow">Now, stop talking about that magic nonsense...</font>

447
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,296
<font color="yellow">and start studying hard again.</font>

448
00:30:21,426 --> 00:30:22,496
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

449
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:24,656
<font color="yellow">What if I don't want to?</font>

450
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,826
<font color="yellow">You still have to do it.</font>

451
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:28,126
<font color="yellow">You will study hard again like you used to.</font>

452
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,056
<font color="yellow">I will make sure that happens.</font>

453
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:36,056
<font color="yellow">I'm going to rip all my books!</font>

454
00:30:40,126 --> 00:30:41,126
<font color="yellow">Okay. Rip them all you like.</font>

455
00:30:41,896 --> 00:30:43,896
<font color="yellow">Rip them if that will help you relieve stress.</font>

456
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:47,226
<font color="yellow">As long as you will study hard again like you used to,</font>

457
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,056
<font color="yellow">I will gladly buy more than 1,000 books.</font>

458
00:30:50,596 --> 00:30:53,256
<font color="yellow">Why don't you keep ripping them?</font>

459
00:30:53,756 --> 00:30:54,926
<font color="yellow">Keep ripping.</font>

460
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:57,356
<font color="yellow">I will come back in exactly 10 minutes.</font>

461
00:31:09,626 --> 00:31:11,196
<font color="yellow">Ah In, are you done, Darling?</font>

462
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:15,496
<font color="yellow">Yes. Here.</font>

463
00:31:18,356 --> 00:31:20,626
<font color="yellow">You did very well.</font>

464
00:31:20,826 --> 00:31:23,826
<font color="yellow">Ah In, you are much better than the boys.</font>

465
00:31:24,096 --> 00:31:25,226
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

466
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,326
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

467
00:31:27,626 --> 00:31:30,426
<font color="yellow">Ah In, you studied 50 words.</font>

468
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,396
<font color="yellow">Should we study 50 more words?</font>

469
00:31:32,596 --> 00:31:34,926
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - You can do it, right?</font>

470
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:39,396
<font color="yellow">You have to write 50 words 10 times, so that's 500 words.</font>

471
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:45,696
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

472
00:31:46,326 --> 00:31:48,256
<font color="yellow">You're home, Son.</font>

473
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,296
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

474
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:50,426
<font color="yellow">Was it not too cold outside?</font>

475
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:51,456
<font color="yellow">It was a little cold.</font>

476
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:53,256
<font color="yellow">Right. Ah In needs to study.</font>

477
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,726
<font color="yellow">Shall we go to your room and talk?</font>

478
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:56,956
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

479
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,556
<font color="yellow">Ah In, keep going.</font>

480
00:31:59,696 --> 00:32:00,956
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

481
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:01,996
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

482
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,596
<font color="yellow">I am sorry I had to take care of Ji Hoon and Ah In...</font>

483
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,026
<font color="yellow">and I couldn't go with you.</font>

484
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,156
<font color="yellow">Did you give your teacher the lesson fee?</font>

485
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:20,326
<font color="yellow">Yes. My teacher said...</font>

486
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:22,696
<font color="yellow">only little kids come with their parents,</font>

487
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,656
<font color="yellow">so I should come alone from now on.</font>

488
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:27,156
<font color="yellow">No, I need to go...</font>

489
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:30,756
<font color="yellow">to check how much you've progressed.</font>

490
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:32,656
<font color="yellow">We will go together next time, okay?</font>

491
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:35,456
<font color="yellow">RIght. How was today's lesson?</font>

492
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,526
<font color="yellow">I practiced vocalization all day again.</font>

493
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:40,156
<font color="yellow">Mom, honestly, it's too tiring and boring.</font>

494
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,426
<font color="yellow">No, Chang Soo.</font>

495
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:44,026
<font color="yellow">The strongest person is he who endures boredom.</font>

496
00:32:44,526 --> 00:32:46,926
<font color="yellow">You have to endure repeating the same things...</font>

497
00:32:47,156 --> 00:32:49,056
<font color="yellow">and practice everyday.</font>

498
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:51,256
<font color="yellow">Only then, you can be a great vocalist.</font>

499
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:54,226
<font color="yellow">- Okay? - Okay, Mom.</font>

500
00:32:55,196 --> 00:32:57,796
<font color="yellow">I am so proud of you, my son.</font>

501
00:32:58,356 --> 00:32:59,356
<font color="yellow">Go take a shower.</font>

502
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:03,426
<font color="yellow">You need to get good grades to enter the art school.</font>

503
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:05,396
<font color="yellow">Why don't you study with me?</font>

504
00:33:05,656 --> 00:33:07,156
<font color="yellow">Sure. Mom,</font>

505
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:10,326
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm destined to sing and study.</font>

506
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:13,526
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

507
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:16,256
<font color="yellow">You're such a good boy.</font>

508
00:33:16,556 --> 00:33:18,996
<font color="yellow">That's my boy.</font>

509
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:20,996
<font color="yellow">How lovely you are.</font>

510
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,956
<font color="yellow">Do you think that's what I wanted?</font>

511
00:33:23,056 --> 00:33:25,556
<font color="yellow">I tried to stop her, saying this is nonsense.</font>

512
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:26,656
<font color="yellow">Then, what?</font>

513
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,396
<font color="yellow">But Hee Sook...</font>

514
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:31,696
<font color="yellow">lost her mind and fiercely yelled at me.</font>

515
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:34,896
<font color="yellow">I couldn't fight with her in front of the kids, so I just left.</font>

516
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:39,326
<font color="yellow">Gosh. She completely beat you.</font>

517
00:33:39,556 --> 00:33:41,796
<font color="yellow">She told me not to come home before midnight.</font>

518
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:44,156
<font color="yellow">Really? You did a great job.</font>

519
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,256
<font color="yellow">- And... - What is it?</font>

520
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,826
<font color="yellow">she asked if you can sleep in the restaurant and not come home.</font>

521
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:52,026
<font color="yellow">- What? - She said the kids can't...</font>

522
00:33:52,026 --> 00:33:54,956
<font color="yellow">sleep tight because of your snoring. And they can't study well next day.</font>

523
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:56,396
<font color="yellow">So she wants you to live here.</font>

524
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,356
<font color="yellow">- What? - This is unbelievable.</font>

525
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:04,626
<font color="yellow">Honey, what should we do with her?</font>

526
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,626
<font color="yellow">We can never defeat her at all.</font>

527
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:08,996
<font color="yellow">What do we do now?</font>

528
00:34:12,256 --> 00:34:13,356
<font color="yellow">I have a headache.</font>

529
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:18,496
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, are you studying?</font>

530
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:19,956
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mom.</font>

531
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,356
<font color="yellow">- I love you. - Me, too.</font>

532
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:38,196
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, did you tear the book apart?</font>

533
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:41,226
<font color="yellow">I bought three more copies for you.</font>

534
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:56,456
<font color="yellow">What happened to Ryu Myung Jin?</font>

535
00:34:56,526 --> 00:34:59,926
<font color="yellow">It's him who sang songs in your room, right?</font>

536
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:02,196
<font color="yellow">Gosh. How did you know that?</font>

537
00:35:02,596 --> 00:35:05,596
<font color="yellow">I ran into him at the faculty cafeteria. What's going on?</font>

538
00:35:06,026 --> 00:35:07,926
<font color="yellow">Why is he in Korea now?</font>

539
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:11,426
<font color="yellow">That's enough. He's Jeong Eun's dad.</font>

540
00:35:11,596 --> 00:35:14,596
<font color="yellow">He's not my daughter's dad. I don't know him.</font>

541
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:18,426
<font color="yellow">He'd disappeared for 30 years. How can he be Jeong Eun's dad?</font>

542
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:21,596
<font color="yellow">Tell me why he's here.</font>

543
00:35:50,026 --> 00:35:51,726
<font color="yellow">I will wait just three months,</font>

544
00:35:53,356 --> 00:35:54,996
<font color="yellow">and if I can't still get over him,</font>

545
00:35:56,026 --> 00:35:57,526
<font color="yellow">I'll move to New York, too.</font>

546
00:36:09,956 --> 00:36:11,156
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

547
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:16,456
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

548
00:36:20,626 --> 00:36:22,156
<font color="yellow">How have you been, my daughter?</font>

549
00:36:22,926 --> 00:36:25,526
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

550
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:30,826
<font color="yellow">- When did you come back? - It's been a couple of days.</font>

551
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:32,496
<font color="yellow">Let me see...</font>

552
00:36:32,496 --> 00:36:35,156
<font color="yellow">if you've become more beautiful during the last six months.</font>

553
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:38,326
<font color="yellow">You've become more handsome.</font>

554
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:39,426
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

555
00:36:40,296 --> 00:36:42,126
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

556
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,456
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

557
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:50,726
<font color="yellow">This is espresso, your favorite.</font>

558
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:53,596
<font color="yellow">Please try it. It is as good as the ones you had in Italy.</font>

559
00:37:03,426 --> 00:37:04,426
<font color="yellow">It's great.</font>

560
00:37:09,156 --> 00:37:12,226
<font color="yellow">Anyway, why did you return to Korea?</font>

561
00:37:12,626 --> 00:37:15,226
<font color="yellow">You didn't tell me you'd come back.</font>

562
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:18,026
<font color="yellow">You appeared...</font>

563
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,396
<font color="yellow">in my life one day out of the blue.</font>

564
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:26,226
<font color="yellow">Is it because I visited you when I was traveling?</font>

565
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,726
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

566
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,996
<font color="yellow">I needed some time to cancel the operas...</font>

567
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:35,296
<font color="yellow">scheduled to be held in Italy and France. That's why I came late.</font>

568
00:37:37,066 --> 00:37:38,426
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

569
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,956
<font color="yellow">Have you...</font>

570
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:46,096
<font color="yellow">met with Mom?</font>

571
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:47,726
<font color="yellow">I have.</font>

572
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:51,196
<font color="yellow">What did she say?</font>

573
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:53,596
<font color="yellow">Didn't she hurt you or something?</font>

574
00:37:53,826 --> 00:37:55,726
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she didn't just let you go.</font>

575
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:58,526
<font color="yellow">She dashed away.</font>

576
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:03,326
<font color="yellow">You should've talked to me first before you went to see her.</font>

577
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:06,926
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have met her alone that recklessly.</font>

578
00:38:06,926 --> 00:38:09,066
<font color="yellow">Dad, you are in danger.</font>

579
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:11,826
<font color="yellow">You really are in danger.</font>

580
00:38:12,856 --> 00:38:15,426
<font color="yellow">I know. It's been about 30 years.</font>

581
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:20,326

586
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:44,496
<font color="yellow">You must bring your mom, too.</font>

587
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,856
<font color="yellow">Dad,</font>

588
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,826
<font color="yellow">she might set off a bomb...</font>

602
00:39:37,156 --> 00:39:39,826
<font color="yellow">No, Mother. I can't tell her to pay back...</font>

603
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:41,756
<font color="yellow">since I'm her mother-in-law.</font>

604
00:39:41,856 --> 00:39:42,896
<font color="yellow">How much is it?</font>

605
00:39:43,496 --> 00:39:45,296
<font color="yellow">It's 79 dollars.</font>

606
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:50,126
<font color="yellow">That's too little. Just think you paid for her this time.</font>

<font color="yellow">Do you think she has no plan to pay back?</font>

614
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,726
<font color="yellow">Yes. I went to her place for that money,</font>

615
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:17,066

<font color="yellow">I'm really on a tight budget.</font>

620
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,726
<font color="yellow">It's not embarrassing for children...</font>

621
00:40:33,726 --> 00:40:36,296
<font color="yellow">to ask their parents for help, while parents cannot even ask...</font>

622
00:40:36,296 --> 00:40:38,796
<font color="yellow">their kids to pay back the borrowed money.</font>

623
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:41,426
<font color="yellow">It is so unfair.</font>

624
00:40:42,696 --> 00:40:44,326
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

625
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,496
<font color="yellow">What should we do to make her pay it back?</font>

626
00:41:00,696 --> 00:41:02,566
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

627
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,956
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me. I'm counting money.</font>

628
00:41:06,496 --> 00:41:07,596
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

629
00:41:12,356 --> 00:41:15,296
<font color="yellow">I have something to tell you.</font>

630
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:17,096
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

631
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:23,226
<font color="yellow">What? What did you say?</font>

632
00:41:23,496 --> 00:41:24,626
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

633
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:27,756
<font color="yellow">are you yelling at me?</font>

634
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:29,426
<font color="yellow">You just made me yell at you.</font>

635
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,856
<font color="yellow">We don't have that large amount of money.</font>

636
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,126
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

637
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:35,456
<font color="yellow">We got the deposit back from our house in Daechi-dong.</font>

638
00:41:35,566 --> 00:41:37,426
<font color="yellow">We already spent one-third of it.</font>

639
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,596
<font color="yellow">What? Where did you spend that much money on?</font>

640
00:41:40,596 --> 00:41:43,656
<font color="yellow">You haven't made money for a while, have you?</font>

641
00:41:43,826 --> 00:41:47,656
<font color="yellow">You were fired from the television show and took money for your office.</font>

642
00:41:48,026 --> 00:41:50,696
<font color="yellow">I still took take care of Ji Hoon.</font>

643
00:41:51,226 --> 00:41:53,226
<font color="yellow">Now we have Chang Soo.</font>

644
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:56,156
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much his tutoring costs?</font>

645
00:41:56,296 --> 00:41:58,896
<font color="yellow">And Ji Hoon needs to resume the private lesson.</font>

646
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:02,896
<font color="yellow">Why do we pay for his private lesson?</font>

647
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:06,526
<font color="yellow">If we don't, Hye Joo won't let him take it. Is that okay with you?</font>

648
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,196
<font color="yellow">And I will buy a piano for Chang Soo this week.</font>

649
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,066
<font color="yellow">What? Why does he need a piano?</font>

650
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:16,856
<font color="yellow">Those who study vocal music all know how to play the piano.</font>

651
00:42:16,926 --> 00:42:19,226
<font color="yellow">He has to pass the piano exam to enter Seoul National University.</font>

652
00:42:19,226 --> 00:42:20,256
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

653
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,426
<font color="yellow">He needs to take a piano lesson...</font>

654
00:42:23,426 --> 00:42:25,426
<font color="yellow">and a sight-singing and ear-training session.</font>

655
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:27,256
<font color="yellow">It costs a bomb.</font>

656
00:42:30,026 --> 00:42:31,126
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

657
00:42:31,996 --> 00:42:35,126
<font color="yellow">Things have become terrible since they were switched.</font>

658
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:38,496
<font color="yellow">Don't say that ever. I will make Chang Soo...</font>

659
00:42:38,796 --> 00:42:41,756
<font color="yellow">a world-class singer by any means.</font>

660
00:42:59,956 --> 00:43:01,026
<font color="yellow">What about me?</font>

661
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:04,156
<font color="yellow">I join Minjeong Party today. I have to make a donation,</font>

662
00:43:04,156 --> 00:43:07,196
<font color="yellow">and I have to pay 20,000 dollars for the by-election.</font>

663
00:43:07,196 --> 00:43:08,656
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do?</font>

664
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,896
<font color="yellow">Stop with the politic nonsense.</font>

665
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:11,996
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

666
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:14,656
<font color="yellow">Just work hard as a lawyer,</font>

667
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:16,256
<font color="yellow">and make money. Okay?</font>

668
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:18,826
<font color="yellow">What... What did you say?</font>

669
00:43:19,326 --> 00:43:22,296
<font color="yellow">Give me money, too. Give me money!</font>

670
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:24,956
<font color="yellow">- Let it go. - You tore it. Give it to me.</font>

671
00:43:24,956 --> 00:43:27,496
<font color="yellow">- You're tearing them. - Let it go!</font>

672
00:43:27,596 --> 00:43:29,196
<font color="yellow">Ouch. My goodness.</font>

673
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:33,126
<font color="yellow">- Oh, dear. My back hurts. - Gosh, my money.</font>

674
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:34,356
<font color="yellow">My back hurts.</font>

675
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:37,256
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, I'm here. Where are you?</font>

676
00:43:37,256 --> 00:43:39,426
<font color="yellow">We're in here. Come inside.</font>

677
00:43:41,726 --> 00:43:42,956
<font color="yellow">Grandmother. Did you want to see me?</font>

678
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:44,956
<font color="yellow">- Come on in. - You're here, too, Mother.</font>

679
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:48,556
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What are you doing?</font>

680
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:51,096
<font color="yellow">Let's play cards.</font>

681
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:53,026
<font color="yellow">- Cards? - Yes.</font>

682
00:43:54,656 --> 00:43:56,996
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae and I wanted to play,</font>

683
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,626
<font color="yellow">but we were short one person. So I called you.</font>

684
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:04,356
<font color="yellow">Oh... I see.</font>

685
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:08,526
<font color="yellow">You brought some money with you, right?</font>

686
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:10,496
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

687
00:44:14,826 --> 00:44:17,056
<font color="yellow">Let's just start playing,</font>

688
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:20,726
<font color="yellow">and if you lose,</font>

689
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:23,456
<font color="yellow">go downstairs and get money. Okay?</font>

690
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:27,396
<font color="yellow">If I lose, of course I will do that.</font>

691
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:31,426
<font color="yellow">By the way, how much is the stake money?</font>

692
00:44:34,226 --> 00:44:35,356
<font color="yellow">Let me do it.</font>

693
00:44:38,696 --> 00:44:40,256
<font color="yellow">Here. Grab some.</font>

694
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:49,656
<font color="yellow">I'll take one of the Bright cards.</font>

695
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:52,556
<font color="yellow">There we go. I'm so lucky.</font>

696
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:54,726
<font color="yellow">- I have nothing to take. - Discard one, then.</font>

697
00:44:54,956 --> 00:44:56,426
<font color="yellow">Oh, I have this.</font>

698
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:03,796
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, you're unlucky with your second cards.</font>

699
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:06,496
<font color="yellow">I've got three Red Ribbon cards.</font>

700
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:09,326
<font color="yellow">Now, this will get me...</font>

701
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:13,596
<font color="yellow">3 Red Ribbon cards and 3 Blue Ribbon cards.</font>

702
00:45:13,656 --> 00:45:16,596
<font color="yellow">Shall we continue? I call the second go.</font>

703
00:45:17,426 --> 00:45:18,656
<font color="yellow">- Oh, dear. - Goodness.</font>

704
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:21,856
<font color="yellow">I have nothing to take. Where did they all go?</font>

705
00:45:23,196 --> 00:45:24,926
<font color="yellow">- There. - Oh, gosh.</font>

706
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:26,796
<font color="yellow">I call the third go.</font>

707
00:45:26,796 --> 00:45:29,796
<font color="yellow">Why can't you take any cards, Mother? Look at this.</font>

708
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:33,056
<font color="yellow">Now, Grandmother owes me nine dollars,</font>

709
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:34,656
<font color="yellow">and Mother owes me five dollars.</font>

710
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:36,556
<font color="yellow">My gosh. If you keep this up,</font>

711
00:45:36,556 --> 00:45:38,396
<font color="yellow">I'll have to sell my land. Here.</font>

712
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:39,656
<font color="yellow">I don't have five dollars.</font>

713
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:41,626
<font color="yellow">This is all I've got left.</font>

714
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:42,756
<font color="yellow">How much is that?</font>

715
00:45:43,196 --> 00:45:44,956
<font color="yellow">It's 4 dollars and 30 cents.</font>

716
00:45:44,956 --> 00:45:46,026
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

717
00:45:46,096 --> 00:45:47,656
<font color="yellow">- Look at her. - Now,</font>

718
00:45:47,756 --> 00:45:49,996
<font color="yellow">this is our final game.</font>

719
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,056
<font color="yellow">Here we go.</font>

720
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:56,356
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I didn't know she was so good at this.</font>

721
00:45:57,526 --> 00:45:59,626
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. Why are you crying?</font>

722
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:01,156
<font color="yellow">I don't believe you.</font>

723
00:46:01,156 --> 00:46:04,596
<font color="yellow">You said you will help me win 79 dollars from Hee Sook.</font>

724
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,896
<font color="yellow">I've lost 15 dollars, let alone winning any money.</font>

725
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:10,856
<font color="yellow">I didn't know she was so good at playing cards.</font>

726
00:46:11,756 --> 00:46:14,696
<font color="yellow">She won all our money. How can she leave...</font>

727
00:46:14,696 --> 00:46:16,626
<font color="yellow">without giving us some winner's tip?</font>

728
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,696
<font color="yellow">What do I do now, Mother?</font>

729
00:46:19,856 --> 00:46:23,396
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook didn't pay me for the groceries, and I lost money to her.</font>

730
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:25,096
<font color="yellow">You should pay me that money yourself.</font>

731
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:27,956
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll pay you.</font>

732
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:30,256
<font color="yellow">Stop crying!</font>

733
00:46:33,096 --> 00:46:35,826
<font color="yellow">Is Dong Hui absent again today?</font>

734
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,096
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

735
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:39,426
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't believe her.</font>

736
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:41,256
<font color="yellow">If she doesn't want to become a writer,</font>

737
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,496
<font color="yellow">she should keep working hard as an office assistant.</font>

738
00:46:43,556 --> 00:46:45,726
<font color="yellow">Look at our office now with her gone.</font>

739
00:46:45,726 --> 00:46:48,426
<font color="yellow">Our office is a big mess.</font>

740
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:50,756
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim. What are you going to do?</font>

741
00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:53,526
<font color="yellow">Leave her be. Let her quit.</font>

742
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:56,656
<font color="yellow">- What? - She's so ungrateful.</font>

743
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:59,826
<font color="yellow">So many people want to become a writer,</font>

744
00:46:59,826 --> 00:47:02,456
<font color="yellow">but she refuses to become one when the director loves her script...</font>

745
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:03,526
<font color="yellow">and our company is backing her up.</font>

746
00:47:04,156 --> 00:47:07,256
<font color="yellow">Leave her be. Let her work as an office assistant forever.</font>

747
00:47:07,256 --> 00:47:09,026
<font color="yellow">Aren't you being too harsh?</font>

748
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,456
<font color="yellow">Maybe Dong Hui is just afraid.</font>

749
00:47:11,656 --> 00:47:14,626
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to be afraid of. She's just acting to be weak.</font>

750
00:47:17,326 --> 00:47:19,856
<font color="yellow">Is Dong Hui absent today as well?</font>

751
00:47:19,896 --> 00:47:21,096
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

752
00:47:21,426 --> 00:47:25,156
<font color="yellow">She must be very sick. She says she can't move at all.</font>

753
00:47:25,256 --> 00:47:28,726
<font color="yellow">You don't have to cover for her. I saw her and she was fine.</font>

754
00:47:28,956 --> 00:47:29,956
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

755
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,426
<font color="yellow">I guess Dong Hui didn't say anything to you.</font>

756
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:42,256
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

757
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:44,756
<font color="yellow">I thought you would rush into my office...</font>

758
00:47:44,756 --> 00:47:46,796
<font color="yellow">and lash out at me again.</font>

759
00:47:47,256 --> 00:47:49,956
<font color="yellow">I went to see Dong Hui yesterday and asked her to sell her synopsis.</font>

760
00:47:50,026 --> 00:47:51,026
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

761
00:47:51,026 --> 00:47:52,096
<font color="yellow">What else could I do?</font>

762
00:47:52,196 --> 00:47:55,156
<font color="yellow">We already got investments, and the TV station wants her synopsis.</font>

763
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,996
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui is a rookie. I didn't have any other choices.</font>

764
00:47:58,196 --> 00:48:00,356
<font color="yellow">Did you really do that?</font>

765
00:48:00,356 --> 00:48:02,256
<font color="yellow">That's why I offered her a handsome amount.</font>

766
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:05,726
<font color="yellow">I haven't even offered that kind of money to any experienced writers.</font>

767
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:07,356
<font color="yellow">That's not what I was asking.</font>

768
00:48:07,356 --> 00:48:08,896
<font color="yellow">Does it have to be Dong Hui?</font>

769
00:48:09,096 --> 00:48:11,096
<font color="yellow">Can't you just give her up?</font>

770
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:14,196
<font color="yellow">This is work. I'm not doing this to take her side.</font>

771
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:16,156
<font color="yellow">Our team's existence depends on this.</font>

772
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:18,756
<font color="yellow">That's why you should convince her to sell her synopsis.</font>

773
00:48:19,556 --> 00:48:22,096
<font color="yellow">Tell her to decide whether she will make a waste,</font>

774
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:24,696
<font color="yellow">or make use of it and gain a foothold.</font>

775
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:26,656
<font color="yellow">It's not a bad offer for her.</font>

776
00:48:26,826 --> 00:48:27,996
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo.</font>

777
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:30,696
<font color="yellow">It's been a while since you called me by my name.</font>

778
00:48:31,726 --> 00:48:33,056
<font color="yellow">We don't have much time.</font>

779
00:48:33,256 --> 00:48:35,826
<font color="yellow">The broadcasting station is rushing us to set up a meeting.</font>

780
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:38,956
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. Please convince her.</font>

781
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:08,096
<font color="yellow">How can you draw red lines on my script, and leave comments like...</font>

782
00:49:08,096 --> 00:49:11,756
<font color="yellow">"It's childish", "It's cliche", "Fix it", and "I don't get this"?</font>

783
00:49:11,896 --> 00:49:13,626
<font color="yellow">How can you be so mean?</font>

784
00:49:13,626 --> 00:49:15,196
<font color="yellow">I was trying to support you.</font>

785
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:17,496
<font color="yellow">Romantic comedy is the most sophisticated genre.</font>

786
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,896
<font color="yellow">The new trend is that the drama either has a fantasy...</font>

787
00:49:20,896 --> 00:49:23,956
<font color="yellow">or fully reflects the reality.</font>

788
00:49:23,956 --> 00:49:25,096
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

789
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:26,126
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

790
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:29,626
<font color="yellow">This is what I'm talking about. When a man and a woman meet,</font>

791
00:49:29,626 --> 00:49:31,156
<font color="yellow">they should confront each other...</font>

792
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:33,696
<font color="yellow">without caring about reasons or courtesy.</font>

793
00:49:34,326 --> 00:49:35,856
<font color="yellow">You said you want to become a writer.</font>

794
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:40,296
<font color="yellow">You should free yourself and be ahead of the viewers.</font>

795
00:49:41,196 --> 00:49:44,026
<font color="yellow">At this rate, the viewers won't wait for you.</font>

796
00:50:58,626 --> 00:50:59,626
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

797
00:51:00,356 --> 00:51:01,396
<font color="yellow">It's me.</font>

798
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,826
<font color="yellow">Yes. Go ahead.</font>

799
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:07,426
<font color="yellow">There are people who have been following me since that day.</font>

800
00:51:07,756 --> 00:51:09,726
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do.</font>

801
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:13,856
<font color="yellow">I can't move out, but I can't stay here, either.</font>

802
00:51:15,026 --> 00:51:18,356
<font color="yellow">Also, the company that Dong Hui works for...</font>

803
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:20,496
<font color="yellow">is Hwashin Group.</font>

804
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:23,426
<font color="yellow">Its name has changed, so I didn't know.</font>

805
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:25,926
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

806
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:28,556
<font color="yellow">If something goes wrong...</font>

807
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:31,826
<font color="yellow">I don't know what I should do.</font>

808
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:33,296
<font color="yellow">That's bad news.</font>

809
00:51:33,926 --> 00:51:38,096
<font color="yellow">Please find Chairwoman Park as soon as possible.</font>

810
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:41,996
<font color="yellow">Where has she been for the past 20 years?</font>

811
00:51:42,496 --> 00:51:44,196
<font color="yellow">Not once...</font>

812
00:51:44,696 --> 00:51:47,726
<font color="yellow">has she ever contacted me. How can she do that?</font>

813
00:51:48,556 --> 00:51:52,456
<font color="yellow">Is it even true that she's still alive?</font>

814
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:55,126
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

815
00:51:55,396 --> 00:51:56,396
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

816
00:51:56,526 --> 00:51:59,556
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh Gui Boon's everyday life haven't changed much since then.</font>

817
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:01,556
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

818
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:03,426
<font color="yellow">She didn't show...</font>

819
00:52:04,196 --> 00:52:06,726
<font color="yellow">any signs of moving out or disappearing.</font>

820
00:52:07,626 --> 00:52:09,826
<font color="yellow">She didn't meet anyone particular, either.</font>

821
00:52:10,596 --> 00:52:12,096
<font color="yellow">What kind of work...</font>

822
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:15,026
<font color="yellow">is Dong Hui doing at my company now?</font>

823
00:52:15,296 --> 00:52:17,226
<font color="yellow">She was hired as an office assistant,</font>

824
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:20,426
<font color="yellow">but her synopsis recently got...</font>

825
00:52:20,426 --> 00:52:22,896
<font color="yellow">an honorable mention at Channel T's contest.</font>

826
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:26,296
<font color="yellow">She may be the writer of the new show of contents marketing team.</font>

827
00:52:28,956 --> 00:52:30,196
<font color="yellow">Writer?</font>

828
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:31,996
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

829
00:52:37,996 --> 00:52:39,356
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, President Bang?</font>

830
00:52:41,096 --> 00:52:42,556
<font color="yellow">Nothing. I'm okay.</font>

831
00:52:43,656 --> 00:52:44,796
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

832
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:48,896
<font color="yellow">miss my sister-in-law who passed away.</font>

833
00:52:50,826 --> 00:52:51,926
<font color="yellow">Your sister-in-law?</font>

834
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:55,256
<font color="yellow">My sister-in-law...</font>

835
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:57,296
<font color="yellow">wanted to be a writer...</font>

836
00:52:58,626 --> 00:53:01,456
<font color="yellow">before she married my brother.</font>

837
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:06,096
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

838
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,056
<font color="yellow">miss her very much today.</font>

839
00:53:57,356 --> 00:53:58,656
<font color="yellow">Yes. What is it?</font>

840
00:53:59,496 --> 00:54:02,596
<font color="yellow">- Can I see you? - I'm busy, too. What is it?</font>

841
00:54:03,096 --> 00:54:04,256
<font color="yellow">I'll wait for you.</font>

842
00:54:25,726 --> 00:54:26,756
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

843
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:31,126
<font color="yellow">What do you want? I'm a busy person, too.</font>

844
00:54:31,126 --> 00:54:32,596
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, fire it away.</font>

845
00:54:33,556 --> 00:54:37,296
<font color="yellow">You didn't come to work today, and you just stayed home.</font>

846
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:40,326
<font color="yellow">How can you tell your boss to come to you?</font>

847
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:42,256
<font color="yellow">Do you think of me...</font>

848
00:54:42,456 --> 00:54:45,656
<font color="yellow">- as some kind of a pushover? - I will do it.</font>

849
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:49,556
<font color="yellow">- What? - I will give it a try.</font>

850
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:53,126
<font color="yellow">I'll write the screenplay version of "Romance Learned through Books".</font>

851
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,656
<font color="yellow">I won't sell my story to anyone.</font>

852
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:58,626
<font color="yellow">I won't let someone else write my story.</font>

853
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:01,956
<font color="yellow">I won't shove it in a dark corner of my room.</font>

854
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:03,556
<font color="yellow">I will give it a try and write it.</font>

855
00:55:04,296 --> 00:55:06,296
<font color="yellow">It's my child, so I will write...</font>

856
00:55:06,326 --> 00:55:08,556
<font color="yellow">and make it see the light.</font>

857
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:12,426
<font color="yellow">- Dong Hui. - Are you happy now?</font>

858
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:19,096
<font color="yellow">So don't talk to me so bluntly like,</font>

859
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:21,096
<font color="yellow">"What is it? I'm busy, too."</font>

860
00:55:23,896 --> 00:55:27,556
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came around. Thank you, Dong Hui.</font>

861
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:30,026
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

862
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:32,056
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

863
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,396
<font color="yellow">Let me hug the writer who will soon become the greatest writer of Korea.</font>

864
00:55:39,126 --> 00:55:40,126
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

865
00:55:40,956 --> 00:55:43,096
<font color="yellow">honestly I am not confident about it.</font>

866
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:50,256
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I'm here for you.</font>

867
00:55:52,526 --> 00:55:53,526
<font color="yellow">You trust me, don't you?</font>

868
00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:56,596
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

869
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:59,826
<font color="yellow">We just have to keep doing what we have been doing.</font>

870
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:02,026
<font color="yellow">We can do well.</font>

871
00:56:02,756 --> 00:56:06,326
<font color="yellow">Trust me and trust yourself.</font>

872
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:10,256
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

873
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,496
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

874
00:56:16,496 --> 00:56:17,626
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dong Hui.</font>

875
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:28,396
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

876
00:56:29,226 --> 00:56:32,526
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling?</font>

877
00:56:33,096 --> 00:56:35,756
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can I not be upset?</font>

878
00:56:35,856 --> 00:56:38,196
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? Repeat what you just said.</font>

879
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:41,826
<font color="yellow">I did my calculation in the office.</font>

880
00:56:42,196 --> 00:56:43,696
<font color="yellow">And I realized that we've spent...</font>

881
00:56:43,696 --> 00:56:46,196
<font color="yellow">a substantial amount of money...</font>

882
00:56:46,196 --> 00:56:47,826
<font color="yellow">while raising Ji Hoon for 15 years.</font>

883
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:50,796
<font color="yellow">The money spent on his food and clothes is okay.</font>

884
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:51,926
<font color="yellow">But the problem is...</font>

885
00:56:52,526 --> 00:56:54,526
<font color="yellow">the money we spent on his education.</font>

886
00:56:54,526 --> 00:56:56,656
<font color="yellow">It adds up to a substantial amount, you see.</font>

887
00:56:56,656 --> 00:56:57,696
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

888
00:56:59,256 --> 00:57:00,756
<font color="yellow">So I was thinking...</font>

889
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:05,326
<font color="yellow">I just entered politics,</font>

890
00:57:06,496 --> 00:57:08,496
<font color="yellow">and I'm a little short on money. Can't you return...</font>

891
00:57:08,856 --> 00:57:12,156
<font color="yellow">a small portion of the money...</font>

892
00:57:12,626 --> 00:57:14,626
<font color="yellow">we have spent on Ji Hoon's education?</font>

893
00:57:14,956 --> 00:57:15,956
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

894
00:57:16,796 --> 00:57:18,756
<font color="yellow">Please?</font>

895
00:57:23,396 --> 00:57:24,796
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

896
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:27,896
<font color="yellow">- Take that and get out of here. - Hey!</font>

897
00:57:28,726 --> 00:57:31,396
<font color="yellow">No matter how desperate you are,</font>

898
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:34,056
<font color="yellow">how can you ask to return the money you spent on your child?</font>

899
00:57:34,296 --> 00:57:36,896
<font color="yellow">We are really struggling these days!</font>

900
00:57:36,896 --> 00:57:39,896
<font color="yellow">Then you should pay for Chang Soo's vocal lessons.</font>

901
00:57:40,626 --> 00:57:42,556
<font color="yellow">Fine. We will pay for Chang Soo's education.</font>

902
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,296
<font color="yellow">So send him back to us.</font>

903
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:48,856
<font color="yellow">You said it. You're really going to pay for...</font>

904
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:51,426
<font color="yellow">- Chang Soo's education, right? - I just said that!</font>

905
00:57:52,026 --> 00:57:54,896
<font color="yellow">- Come here. I will kill you. - Why are you...</font>

906
00:57:54,896 --> 00:57:56,956
<font color="yellow">- threatening me with a chicken? - Come here!</font>

907
00:57:57,326 --> 00:57:58,796
<font color="yellow">Come here!</font>

908
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,396
<font color="yellow">- Gosh! I will get back at you! - Hey! Come here.</font>

909
00:58:02,426 --> 00:58:05,196
<font color="yellow">I am going to tell mom that you hit me.</font>

910
00:58:05,196 --> 00:58:06,826
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and tell her, you idiot!</font>

911
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:09,426
<font color="yellow">I avoided it! How's that?</font>

912
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,096
<font color="yellow">Gosh, he's unbelievable.</font>

913
00:58:16,996 --> 00:58:19,456
<font color="yellow">Goodness, I am sorry about this.</font>

914
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:23,756
<font color="yellow">- Can I still get fried chicken? - Of course you can. Come in.</font>

915
00:58:35,356 --> 00:58:37,196
<font color="yellow">Which one would you like to order?</font>

916
00:58:38,856 --> 00:58:39,856
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

917
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:43,056
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the chicken.</font>

918
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:49,096
<font color="yellow">You are Hyung Seop's eldest son, Seong Hoon, aren't you?</font>

919
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:50,996
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

920
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:57,156
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - You're Seong Joon, aren't you?</font>
