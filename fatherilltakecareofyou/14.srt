<font color="yellow">It's a blessing that...</font>

5
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,749

<font color="yellow">I'm an aspiring writer,</font>

7

<font color="yellow">so I know how it feels...</font>

8

<font color="yellow">just either in novel or in reality.</font>

20
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:41,949
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to give up?</font>

21
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,279
<font color="yellow">You can just love in reality...</font>

22
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,349
<font color="yellow">like you do in novels.</font>

23
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,579
<font color="yellow">You also know well...</font>

24
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:51,949
<font color="yellow">that the reality...</font>

25
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,449
<font color="yellow">is far different from novels.</font>

26
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,649

28

<font color="yellow">to spare for anything else.</font>

33
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:19,919
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

34
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,349
<font color="yellow">To like someone...</font>

35
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,449
<font color="yellow">is something very exciting,</font>

36
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,019
<font color="yellow">isn't it?</font>

37
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,919
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

38

00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:16,449
<font color="yellow">We must get everything done by this week.</font>

43
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:18,719
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir! - Okay!</font>

44
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,619
<font color="yellow">Sir, you're here.</font>

45
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,179
<font color="yellow">I heard that you're having a year-end party here tonight.</font>

46
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,319
<font color="yellow">We are. Thank you.</font>

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,519
<font color="yellow">Please make sure you drink them after work.</font>

48
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,919
<font color="yellow">Of course, we will drink them when we're done.</font>

49
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,319
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

50
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:22,379
<font color="yellow">It must be tough for you.</font>

51
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,549
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I'm not supposed to drink while on duty.</font>

52
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,979
<font color="yellow">Well, it's a rough job, so many workers do that.</font>

53
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,979
<font color="yellow">But you shouldn't drink too much.</font>

54
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:38,379
<font color="yellow">I won't. I apologize.</font>

55
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:40,449
<font color="yellow">Let me pour you a shot.</font>

56
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:43,219
<font color="yellow">Please give me.</font>

57
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,949
<font color="yellow">But... Sir...</font>

58
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,319
<font color="yellow">- This will be the last shot, okay? - Okay.</font>

59
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,179
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll drink my last shot.</font>

60
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,179
<font color="yellow">Gosh, get out.</font>

61
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:26,819
<font color="yellow">I said step aside.</font>

62
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,649
<font color="yellow">- What's going on? - What happened?</font>

63
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,879
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, he fell off. - Come quickly.</font>

64
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,979
<font color="yellow">- Stay still. - My goodness.</font>

65
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,149
<font color="yellow">- What happened to him? - This is really bad.</font>

66
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,249
<font color="yellow">- Call 911 now! - Hang in there.</font>

67
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,849
<font color="yellow">- Is he all right? - Call 911!</font>

68
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:14,249
<font color="yellow">- Will he be all right? - Call an ambulance right now.</font>

69
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,549
<font color="yellow">- Wake up! - Hello?</font>

70
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,279
<font color="yellow">- A worker fell from a building. - Goodness.</font>

71
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,679
<font color="yellow">This is really terrible.</font>

72
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:27,049
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that you consider getting divorced in your 60s.</font>

73
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,179
<font color="yellow">You've lived together for a long time.</font>

74
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,319
<font color="yellow">It's time to think about how to spend the rest of your life well.</font>

75
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,949
<font color="yellow">If you get divorced at your age,</font>

76
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,349
<font color="yellow">who do you think will take care of you?</font>

77
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,579
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

78
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,949
<font color="yellow">I can live on my own.</font>

79
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,819
<font color="yellow">He can live with our children...</font>

80
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:47,479
<font color="yellow">and take care of them for the rest of his life.</font>

81
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,079
<font color="yellow">That's where he finds happiness.</font>

82
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,049
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean by that? - Hey! Be quiet!</font>

83
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:57,019
<font color="yellow">Aren't you ashamed of yourselves in front of your grown-up children?</font>

84
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,449
<font color="yellow">There are neither children nor grandchildren...</font>

85
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,819
<font color="yellow">who would respect their parents or grandparents...</font>

86
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:06,719
<font color="yellow">who got divorced in their later years.</font>

87
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,319
<font color="yellow">Mother, it's no longer a matter...</font>

88
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,649
<font color="yellow">of winning respect, but a matter of survival.</font>

89
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,079
<font color="yellow">If you give them everything we have, we'll end up with nothing...</font>

90
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,849
<font color="yellow">when we grow even older.</font>

91
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:18,979
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

92
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,349
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that's too much?</font>

93
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:26,079
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Did you just yell at me?</font>

94
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,449
<font color="yellow">Do you think opening a shop for Seong Hoon is a good idea?</font>

95
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,179
<font color="yellow">Maintain your dignity as their mother.</font>

96
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,819
<font color="yellow">Stop such nonsense.</font>

97
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,519
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can maintain your dignity when you become penniless?</font>

98
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,119
<font color="yellow">You can have it only when you have money.</font>

99
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:42,149
<font color="yellow">Then, let's just get divorced!</font>

100
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,949
<font color="yellow">- That's exactly what I want. - Stop!</font>

101
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,179
<font color="yellow">Stop nagging at your children.</font>

102
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,279
<font color="yellow">You should be the ones who should move out of my place.</font>

103
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,149
<font color="yellow">You two are shortening my life right now.</font>

154
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,179

00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,379
<font color="yellow">so they stopped me from coming.</font>

157
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,919
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they calling by the way? They have to tell me...</font>

158
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,019
<font color="yellow">how he is to feel relieved.</font>

159
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,919
<font color="yellow">Goodness. My heart and hands are trembling.</font>

160
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:08,449
<font color="yellow">I can't do anything.</font>

161
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:10,349
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

162
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:13,579
<font color="yellow">We just found out about Chang Soo and Ji Hoon.</font>

163
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,819
<font color="yellow">And this happened to our eldest grandson.</font>

164
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,379
<font color="yellow">Doctor, what happened to our son?</font>

165
00:11:25,849 --> 00:11:26,849
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

166
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,419
<font color="yellow">When someone falls from a high place,</font>

167
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:31,079
<font color="yellow">shoulder or collarbone fracture usually happens.</font>

168
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,419
<font color="yellow">Fortunately, his shoulders and collarbones are fine.</font>

169
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,749
<font color="yellow">His forehead is slightly lacerated,</font>

170
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,719
<font color="yellow">and he's complaining of pain in right arm and left leg,</font>

171
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,449
<font color="yellow">so I'm suspecting minor fracture.</font>

172
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,149
<font color="yellow">But what worries me more is...</font>

173
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,779
<font color="yellow">that he keeps vomiting.</font>

174
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:51,879
<font color="yellow">We have to check for cerebral hemorrhage and spine fracture.</font>

175
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:53,449
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

176
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,179
<font color="yellow">Cerebral hemorrhage and spine fracture?</font>

177
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,919
<font color="yellow">What will happen, then?</font>

178
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,949
<font color="yellow">We have to check him,</font>

179
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,319
<font color="yellow">but if any of them happens,</font>

180
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,819
<font color="yellow">he may be paralyzed below the waist.</font>

181
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,419
<font color="yellow">Mother. Mother.</font>

182
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,149
<font color="yellow">Mother. Mother.</font>

183
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:23,379
<font color="yellow">How can this happen to him?</font>

184
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,519
<font color="yellow">Let's get an MRI scan first.</font>

185
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:27,249
<font color="yellow">Mother. Mother.</font>

186
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,949
<font color="yellow">Mother. Wake up, Mother.</font>

187
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,779
<font color="yellow">Do not transport materials until we reinforce the handrail.</font>

188
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,579
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

189
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:51,249
<font color="yellow">What did you do to my son, you moron?</font>

190
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,179
<font color="yellow">What did you do to make him like that?</font>

191
00:12:54,219 --> 00:12:55,879
<font color="yellow">Bring my son back!</font>

192
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,379
<font color="yellow">Sir, please calm down.</font>

193
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,349
<font color="yellow">How can I calm down?</font>

194
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:03,179
<font color="yellow">He has two children, and he's about to die.</font>

195
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,649
<font color="yellow">- Save my son! - Sir.</font>

196
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:07,849
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

197
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,379
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Let go of me!</font>

198
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:13,319
<font color="yellow">Save my son, moron!</font>

199
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,679
<font color="yellow">Save my son!</font>

200
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:17,379
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

201
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:19,579
<font color="yellow">- Stop. - Let go!</font>

202
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,949
<font color="yellow">Let go of me!</font>

203
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,679
<font color="yellow">I'm going to sue all of you.</font>

204
00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:26,879
<font color="yellow">Sir, why are you putting the blame on him?</font>

205
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,949
<font color="yellow">He didn't do anything wrong.</font>

206
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:31,619
<font color="yellow">Come this way. Talk to me.</font>

207
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:33,679
<font color="yellow">Come this way.</font>

208
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,119
<font color="yellow">Look at this. This is the soju Seong Hoon's been drinking.</font>

209
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:04,179
<font color="yellow">Who on earth would work after drinking?</font>

210
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,049
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

211
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,249
<font color="yellow">What do you mean my son was drunk?</font>

212
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:12,319
<font color="yellow">He hid over there and drank about one bottle.</font>

213
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,449
<font color="yellow">If you lie, I am going to put you in jail, too.</font>

214
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:19,019
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense at all. My son would never drink.</font>

215
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,519
<font color="yellow">So let's go to the hospital.</font>

216
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,649
<font color="yellow">When we took him to the hospital,</font>

217
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,679
<font color="yellow">they took his sobriety test.</font>

218
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:28,279
<font color="yellow">Let's go and ask the doctor.</font>

219
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:40,279
<font color="yellow">Bring my son back!</font>

220
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,649
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

221
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,119
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, what brings you here?</font>

222
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,879
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you're here.</font>

223
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,749
<font color="yellow">Can you help me with this? This bulb is burned out.</font>

224
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,679
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

225
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:34,619
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

226
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,279
<font color="yellow">You are MacGyver of Bangbae-dong.</font>

227
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,449
<font color="yellow">It's not for free. I'm going to charge you for the service.</font>

228
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,779
<font color="yellow">I don't have money.</font>

229
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,419
<font color="yellow">I haven't sold any coffee yet.</font>

230
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,219
<font color="yellow">Are you proud of that?</font>

231
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,579
<font color="yellow">How can you pay back the loan?</font>

232
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:55,219
<font color="yellow">Don't you know me? I was the goddess barista of New York,</font>

233
00:15:55,649 --> 00:15:56,819
<font color="yellow">Gold Cat.</font>

234
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:59,949
<font color="yellow">Goddess barista? Right.</font>

235
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,149
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

236
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,819
<font color="yellow">Wake up. Here is your pay.</font>

237
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:37,019
<font color="yellow">Eat. It's for changing the bulb.</font>

238
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:39,879
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to eat it?</font>

239
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:46,679
<font color="yellow">I will eat it. Apparently, it's my pay.</font>

240
00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:59,119
<font color="yellow">By the way, I've been curious about this for three years.</font>

241
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,319
<font color="yellow">Do you have a story about cucumber sandwich?</font>

242
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,519
<font color="yellow">All right. All right.</font>

243
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:13,249
<font color="yellow">Your eyes tell me that I shouldn't have mentioned it.</font>

244
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:17,079
<font color="yellow">I don't know what it is, but I won't get curious.</font>

245
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,319
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

246
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:24,049
<font color="yellow">blow on it and drink all of it.</font>

247
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,549
<font color="yellow">Chamomile tea is good for calming your mind.</font>

248
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,619
<font color="yellow">You look unusually tired today.</font>

249
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:32,649
<font color="yellow">You're okay, right?</font>

250
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:39,889
<font color="yellow">All right. All right. I won't ask anything.</font>

251
00:17:40,819 --> 00:17:44,249
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep giving me the angry eyes? Are you an actor?</font>

252
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,079
<font color="yellow">You are Mr. Mystery.</font>

253
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,979
<font color="yellow">I did...</font>

254
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:57,119
<font color="yellow">something bad today.</font>

255
00:18:01,449 --> 00:18:03,949
<font color="yellow">Something bad? What is that bad thing?</font>

256
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:08,449
<font color="yellow">Did you push a pooping child and drive a stake into a pumpkin?</font>

257
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,949
<font color="yellow">Or did you...</font>

258
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:12,719
<font color="yellow">cruelly step on an ant?</font>

259
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:15,519
<font color="yellow">Or did you honestly tell an elder that she's fat and ugly?</font>

260
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,779
<font color="yellow">Or did you tell someone wearing a wig that...</font>

261
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,019
<font color="yellow">you can see that he's wearing a wig?</font>

262
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:25,849
<font color="yellow">You are very bad.</font>

263
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,019
<font color="yellow">You are just like David Lee of Golden Street I know.</font>

264
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,819
<font color="yellow">You didn't hurt somebody, did you?</font>

265
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,119
<font color="yellow">As long as it's not that, you're fine.</font>

266
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,449
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

267
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:47,849
<font color="yellow">you have to pay for your sin if you want to get rid of bad luck.</font>

268
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,179
<font color="yellow">I forgive your sins.</font>

269
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:55,449
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

270
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,849
<font color="yellow">Hello. Welcome.</font>

271
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:00,679
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

272
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:03,579
<font color="yellow">- Can I have a cup of black coffee? - Okay.</font>

273
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,779
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

274
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:06,719
<font color="yellow">I will have the espresso.</font>

275
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:10,149
<font color="yellow">So you ordered black coffee and espresso.</font>

276
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,719
<font color="yellow">Hello, I am from the headquarter.</font>

277
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:17,249
<font color="yellow">I am Oh Dong Hui from Contents and Marketing Team.</font>

278
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,819
<font color="yellow">- Have this. - Thank you.</font>

279
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:32,219
<font color="yellow">I finished going over the documents. Thank you for your help.</font>

280
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,049
<font color="yellow">Please drink some.</font>

281
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:36,449
<font color="yellow">It's freezing outside.</font>

282
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:39,119
<font color="yellow">Your cheeks are all reddened.</font>

283
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,349
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

284
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,849
<font color="yellow">You visited all of these branches?</font>

285
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:49,619
<font color="yellow">Other employees only visit the half of the list.</font>

286
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,519
<font color="yellow">You are very productive.</font>

287
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:54,219
<font color="yellow">It's my job.</font>

288
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,389
<font color="yellow">This is the concept book.</font>

289
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,649
<font color="yellow">This book will help the customers to dress nicely on a daily basis.</font>

290
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:02,719
<font color="yellow">Fashion manners and practical tips can be found there.</font>

291
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,179
<font color="yellow">I thought it would be helpful for the customers.</font>

292
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:09,279
<font color="yellow">My gosh, you are good at your job.</font>

293
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,449
<font color="yellow">A couple, wearing the jacket lies down side by side in the city.</font>

294
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,079
<font color="yellow">Soon, the scene changes into the one from "Love Story".</font>

295
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:24,389
<font color="yellow">Oh Dong Hui came up with...</font>

296
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,579
<font color="yellow">the initial idea and the storyboard.</font>

297
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,889
<font color="yellow">Oh Dong Hui did this?</font>

298
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,749
<font color="yellow">Who knew she could pull it off? Because she is new,</font>

299
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:33,619
<font color="yellow">her thinking is quite refreshing.</font>

300
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:36,849
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Ms. Na?</font>

301
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:39,919
<font color="yellow">I think this can be useful for viral marketing with social media.</font>

302
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,849
<font color="yellow">The commercial will appeal to people in their 20s and 30s.</font>

303
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:45,049
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

304
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,419
<font color="yellow">We already signed the male model.</font>

305
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:49,219
<font color="yellow">We decided to select the female model from our employees.</font>

306
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,049
<font color="yellow">Regarding the nominees for the commercial,</font>

307
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,149
<font color="yellow">we are taking votes through social media.</font>

308
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,549

<font color="yellow">It's not that.</font>

322
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,749
<font color="yellow">Do you have to be so cold-hearted towards me?</font>

323
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,679
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will make it brief.</font>

<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

397
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,779
<font color="yellow">I made a fuss because...</font>

402
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:18,619
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

<font color="yellow">Isn't he my son, too?</font>

407
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,149
<font color="yellow">But still.</font>

408
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,449

416
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:15,679
<font color="yellow">to raise his children.</font>

417
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,419

<font color="yellow">Look at you. What's all this?</font>

430
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,379
<font color="yellow">I really have no idea what's with you.</font>

431
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,079
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

432
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,079
<font color="yellow">We have to wait for the examination results,</font>

433
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,879
<font color="yellow">but the doctor said his spine and brain seem to be okay.</font>

434
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:18,679
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

435
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:19,779
<font color="yellow">Thank goodness.</font>

436
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,249
<font color="yellow">I'm relieved to hear that.</font>

437
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:30,819
<font color="yellow">You're back.</font>

438
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:34,419
<font color="yellow">What happened to him? Why didn't you call me?</font>

439
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:36,149
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

440
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,819
<font color="yellow">I had no time to make a phone call.</font>

441
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,119
<font color="yellow">So is Seong Hoon okay?</font>

442
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,149
<font color="yellow">He is.</font>

443
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,119

<font color="yellow">Come here, my Ah In.</font>

463
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:16,349
<font color="yellow">You're such a good girl. He's all right.</font>

464
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:19,279
<font color="yellow">Stop crying. Don't worry.</font>

465
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,249
<font color="yellow">I need you to make kids dinner.</font>

466
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:30,979
<font color="yellow">- Why do I have to? - Let's talk about...</font>

467
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:33,879
<font color="yellow">our old grudges and our switched kids later.</font>

468
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:40,749
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon had an accident,</font>

469
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,549
<font color="yellow">so I have to stay at the hospital.</font>

470
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:45,249
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what happened to him?</font>

471
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,679
<font color="yellow">I'll explain later.</font>

472
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,579
<font color="yellow">Make dinner for Chang Soo, Ah In, and Ji Hoon, okay?</font>

473
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,579
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo!</font>

474
00:31:58,619 --> 00:31:59,619
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

475
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:02,919
<font color="yellow">I mean, Aunt.</font>

476
00:32:03,619 --> 00:32:06,379
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you are so peaceful right now.</font>

477
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:09,679
<font color="yellow">Your ex-father is in the hospital.</font>

478
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:11,519
<font color="yellow">How could you possibly enjoy that hot dog?</font>

479
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,079
<font color="yellow">Is he in a hospital now?</font>

480
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,449
<font color="yellow">I need you to take good care of Ji Hoon and Ah In, okay?</font>

481
00:32:19,249 --> 00:32:21,149
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

482
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:30,179
<font color="yellow">- Where's Ji Hoon? - He said he doesn't want to eat.</font>

483
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:32,879
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

484
00:32:33,049 --> 00:32:34,619
<font color="yellow">("This time, I'm a magician")</font>

485
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:37,779
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

486
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:43,279
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Why are you not having dinner?</font>

487
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:45,719
<font color="yellow">I'm not hungry.</font>

488
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,419
<font color="yellow">Isn't it because you don't want to see me?</font>

489
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,019
<font color="yellow">What book were you reading just now?</font>

490
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:03,049
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing. - Give it to me.</font>

491
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:07,119
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to. - Do you know what time it is?</font>

492
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:10,319
<font color="yellow">You must be receiving your private lesson at this hour.</font>

493
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:12,079
<font color="yellow">Why are you reading a useless book like that?</font>

494
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,549
<font color="yellow">- Give it to me already. - I don't want to.</font>

495
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,749
<font color="yellow">Is that why you wanted to live here?</font>

496
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:20,649
<font color="yellow">You decided to live here so that you can waste as much time as you want?</font>

497
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,379
<font color="yellow">Did you abandon your mom...</font>

498
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,849
<font color="yellow">who raised you for 15 years for this?</font>

499
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:27,519
<font color="yellow">Give the book to me!</font>

500
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:31,019
<font color="yellow">I said no! You're not even my mom.</font>

501
00:33:31,449 --> 00:33:33,349
<font color="yellow">Why do you care about me?</font>

502
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:40,249
<font color="yellow">What? Ji Hoon!</font>

503
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:46,649
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, stop right there! Ji Hoon!</font>

504
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:51,649
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

505
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:54,349
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

506
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,619
<font color="yellow">I put all my time and efforts for you.</font>

507
00:33:56,979 --> 00:33:58,719
<font color="yellow">I devoted all my life to you!</font>

508
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,789
<font color="yellow">How can you change your attitude toward me this quickly?</font>

509
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:04,879
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

510
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,579
<font color="yellow">Ah In, stop crying.</font>

511
00:34:09,749 --> 00:34:11,049
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

512
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:14,819
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Stop crying.</font>

513
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:19,579
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

514
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,819
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're here.</font>

515
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:25,419
<font color="yellow">Here is my Ah In.</font>

516
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:27,319
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

517
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:30,289
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you. My little girl.</font>

518
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,349
<font color="yellow">Ah In kept crying because Mom and Dad are away.</font>

519
00:34:34,979 --> 00:34:36,449
<font color="yellow">- Grandma. - It's okay.</font>

520
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,019
<font color="yellow">This is my cute Ah In.</font>

521
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,579
<font color="yellow">My poor kids.</font>

522
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,319
<font color="yellow">Dad, please go home.</font>

523
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:53,379
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo will be here soon.</font>

524
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:55,749
<font color="yellow">Please go home.</font>

525
00:34:59,919 --> 00:35:01,319
<font color="yellow">Did you drink?</font>

526
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,789
<font color="yellow">Is that really true?</font>

527
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:10,679
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Why did you do that?</font>

528
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,149
<font color="yellow">Well, I just had a little...</font>

529
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:21,379
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me earlier if things were that tough?</font>

530
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,179
<font color="yellow">I cannot ask for your help any more. It's too shameless.</font>

531
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:30,079
<font color="yellow">Still, I'm your father.</font>

532
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:32,249
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

533
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,749
<font color="yellow">There's no need to feel shameless to your parents.</font>

534
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,519
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to trouble you so often.</font>

535
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:40,949
<font color="yellow">I can't say anything, but I'm sorry.</font>

536
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,549
<font color="yellow">You know what?</font>

537
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,579
<font color="yellow">I think you're the worst one.</font>

538
00:35:58,349 --> 00:35:59,549
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

539
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:11,679
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

540
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:13,519
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

541
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,179
<font color="yellow">- Grandma. - You're back.</font>

542
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:20,289
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon had an accident, so the kids came up here.</font>

543
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,579
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

544
00:36:22,419 --> 00:36:25,419
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

545
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:28,119
<font color="yellow">My little Ah In is a good girl.</font>

546
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:29,879
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

547
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:32,179
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

548
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,149
<font color="yellow">I want you to go downstairs and take care of Seong Hoon's kids.</font>

549
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:39,419
<font color="yellow">They must be in a daze now.</font>

550
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:42,649
<font color="yellow">I will. Don't worry.</font>

551
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:45,579
<font color="yellow">I'll stay over at the hospital, then.</font>

552
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:50,649
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo and your dad are staying there.</font>

553
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,249
<font color="yellow">There's no room for you.</font>

554
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:55,379
<font color="yellow">Please just take care of the kids.</font>

555
00:36:56,849 --> 00:36:57,979
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

556
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,749
<font color="yellow">Aunt, I can hold her.</font>

557
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,179
<font color="yellow">It's all right. She wants to stay on my back.</font>

558
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:11,449
<font color="yellow">Uncle, you're here.</font>

559
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:18,019
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Chang Soo?</font>

560
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:20,679
<font color="yellow">I have no idea why things are going crazy.</font>

561
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:23,519
<font color="yellow">We have one problem after another.</font>

562
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:26,219
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you talk like a grownup.</font>

563
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:28,179
<font color="yellow">- By the way, - Yes?</font>

564
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:29,849
<font color="yellow">I need to go to bathroom.</font>

565
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:41,449
<font color="yellow">Please let me hold Ah In. I will put her to sleep.</font>

566
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:45,019
<font color="yellow">It's okay. She wants to be with me.</font>

567
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:49,319
<font color="yellow">Ah In, let me hold you.</font>

568
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:52,789
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

569
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:53,849
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

570
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,749
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

571
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,289
<font color="yellow">Stay with me.</font>

572
00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:05,379
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

573
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,079
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

574
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,289
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

575
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,019
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

576
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:50,979
<font color="yellow">I just wondered...</font>

577
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,349
<font color="yellow">if you've been doing well.</font>

578
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:56,379
<font color="yellow">I'm good thanks to you.</font>

579
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,219
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

580
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:05,819
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Ah In.</font>

581
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:08,049
<font color="yellow">I will go down often.</font>

582
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,049
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

583
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:13,949
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

584
00:40:01,379 --> 00:40:03,449
<font color="yellow">("Theoretical Love")</font>

585
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,319
<font color="yellow">Children are children.</font>

586
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:42,449
<font color="yellow">Children don't think about their parents.</font>

587
00:40:44,379 --> 00:40:45,619
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

588
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,649
<font color="yellow">Go to your room.</font>

589
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:51,819
<font color="yellow">How can I go to my room when you are crying like this?</font>

590
00:40:53,249 --> 00:40:54,249
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

591
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,289
<font color="yellow">I told you not to call me mom...</font>

592
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,219
<font color="yellow">because I'm not used to the fact that you are my son.</font>

593
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:05,049
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I will call you Aunt.</font>

594
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,019
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter to me.</font>

595
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,719
<font color="yellow">Hold on. There's an eyelash.</font>

596
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,979
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

597
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:14,649
<font color="yellow">Get that hand off me.</font>

598
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,079
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go...</font>

599
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:28,449
<font color="yellow">and find my Ji Hoon?</font>

600
00:41:28,789 --> 00:41:30,219
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon isn't home, right?</font>

601
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:32,649
<font color="yellow">Go and look for Ji Hoon.</font>

602
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,849
<font color="yellow">What a horrible child.</font>

603
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,349
<font color="yellow">How can he torture you like this?</font>

604
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:47,919
<font color="yellow">Should I hit him?</font>

605
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,149
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

606
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,449
<font color="yellow">Get me some more tissue.</font>

607
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:55,949
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

608
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:11,379
<font color="yellow">How is he?</font>

609
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:15,249
<font color="yellow">He's with Hye Joo.</font>

610
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:19,179
<font color="yellow">Is he in serious pain?</font>

611
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:22,049
<font color="yellow">The nurse gave him painkiller.</font>

612
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:25,419
<font color="yellow">How can he not feel pain? He fell off from the third floor.</font>

613
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,449
<font color="yellow">President.</font>

614
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:11,789
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

615
00:43:23,579 --> 00:43:24,719
<font color="yellow">Cancel it.</font>

616
00:43:27,049 --> 00:43:28,519
<font color="yellow">Just like you told me,</font>

617
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,579
<font color="yellow">cancel the pension and give it to Seong Hoon.</font>

618
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:33,979
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

619
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:36,349
<font color="yellow">My son is about to die.</font>

620
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,279
<font color="yellow">What difference does money make?</font>

621
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:42,919
<font color="yellow">Cancel it and give this to him.</font>

622
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,449
<font color="yellow">I was worried that he would live longer than me.</font>

623
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,779
<font color="yellow">That's why I was holding on to that money.</font>

624
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:54,949
<font color="yellow">It wasn't just for me.</font>

625
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,119
<font color="yellow">My son is about to die before me.</font>

626
00:43:59,719 --> 00:44:01,079
<font color="yellow">What different does it make?</font>

627
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,649
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

628
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:05,649
<font color="yellow">Cancel it tomorrow and give it to him.</font>

629
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:11,549
<font color="yellow">We lived more than they did.</font>

630
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,949
<font color="yellow">If we live longer than now...</font>

631
00:44:18,419 --> 00:44:20,779
<font color="yellow">or even if we go somewhere and die,</font>

632
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:23,919
<font color="yellow">we wouldn't have any regrets.</font>

633
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:26,179
<font color="yellow">Honey. My gosh.</font>

634
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:49,419
<font color="yellow">People say it is "The Pain of Intestine".</font>

635
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,819
<font color="yellow">The intestine of parents...</font>

636
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,049
<font color="yellow">whose children die before them will break.</font>

637
00:44:55,449 --> 00:44:57,649
<font color="yellow">They will go blind because they cry a lot.</font>

638
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:59,579
<font color="yellow">Even if it's not the intestine,</font>

639
00:45:00,919 --> 00:45:03,149
<font color="yellow">no pain will top the pain they feel...</font>

640
00:45:03,819 --> 00:45:05,619
<font color="yellow">when they see their children in pain.</font>

641
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:12,449
<font color="yellow">Now their children are in a predicament.</font>

642
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,579
<font color="yellow">Let us see what they will do...</font>

643
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,719
<font color="yellow">to help their children.</font>

644
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,349
<font color="yellow">How is it? Isn't it nice? Doesn't it energize you?</font>

645
00:45:41,419 --> 00:45:44,319
<font color="yellow">Do you know how good pickled ginseng is?</font>

646
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:47,119
<font color="yellow">I want another cup of this.</font>

647
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,519
<font color="yellow">Do you want more?</font>

648
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,949
<font color="yellow">I need to bring warm water. Hold on.</font>

649
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:10,679
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

650
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,049
<font color="yellow">I am okay. How else would I be?</font>

651
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,319
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

652
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,249
<font color="yellow">He's going to be discharged today.</font>

653
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:20,449
<font color="yellow">You don't need to worry any more.</font>

654
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:21,979
<font color="yellow">I know, Mother.</font>

655
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:24,679
<font color="yellow">Raising children makes you worry.</font>

656
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,949
<font color="yellow">I told you it will continue until the moment you die.</font>

657
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:28,449
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

658
00:46:28,979 --> 00:46:30,979
<font color="yellow">You are right, Mother.</font>

659
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:39,519
<font color="yellow">But why are you crying again?</font>

660
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,819
<font color="yellow">You cried a lot already.</font>

661
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:42,979
<font color="yellow">Just because...</font>

662
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,249
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

663
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:48,579
<font color="yellow">I just feel...</font>

664
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:51,119
<font color="yellow">so pathetic of myself.</font>

665
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:55,449
<font color="yellow">Who knew I would be in this kind of situation?</font>

666
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,119
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

667
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:01,719
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing? Your sister-in-law wants another cup.</font>

668
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,149
<font color="yellow">I'm boiling the water now.</font>

669
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:07,419
<font color="yellow">It's been a while. Why are you still boiling the water?</font>

670
00:47:07,419 --> 00:47:10,819
<font color="yellow">Because you look down on your sister-in-law,</font>

671
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:13,119
<font color="yellow">she is still sad.</font>

672
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:16,519
<font color="yellow">Do you know how tired she is nowadays?</font>

673
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:20,279
<font color="yellow">My goodness. She acts too much.</font>

674
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:23,519
<font color="yellow">You should be helpful if you are sister-in-law.</font>

675
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,719
<font color="yellow">Hey, if you aren't going to be helpful, don't even come.</font>

676
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,319
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, don't just lean on me.</font>

677
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,019
<font color="yellow">Lean on Seong Joon. He's stronger.</font>

678
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:41,179
<font color="yellow">If I can move my body as I wish, why would you be here?</font>

679
00:47:41,649 --> 00:47:44,079
<font color="yellow">- Lean on me. - Okay.</font>

680
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,149
<font color="yellow">Here. Try to maintain your balance.</font>

681
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:51,549
<font color="yellow">Okay, let's go there.</font>

682
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:53,919
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

683
00:47:54,149 --> 00:47:55,219
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

684
00:47:58,119 --> 00:47:59,179
<font color="yellow">It's Hye Joo.</font>

685
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:01,249
<font color="yellow">Tell her that I am home.</font>

686
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,419
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Seong Hoon</font>

687
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,579
<font color="yellow">Try please.</font>

688
00:48:05,379 --> 00:48:06,449
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hye Joo?</font>

689
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:09,749
<font color="yellow">Hi, Seong Joon. I was wondering how my husband is.</font>

690
00:48:09,919 --> 00:48:11,919
<font color="yellow">I should have been there, but I am at work.</font>

691
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,319
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Hye Joo.</font>

692
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,979
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik and I were there when he was discharged.</font>

693
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:17,749
<font color="yellow">We brought Seong Hoon home.</font>

694
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:19,119
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

695
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:20,619
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

696
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,649
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, I will call you later.</font>

697
00:48:23,749 --> 00:48:24,819
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

698
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,319
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

699
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,149
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

700
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:29,649
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Okay.</font>

701
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:32,019
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Seong Sik. - Hey.</font>

702
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:34,019
<font color="yellow">- Help him from that side. - Be careful.</font>

703
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:36,019
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

704
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:37,349
<font color="yellow">Walk slowly.</font>

705
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,319
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

706
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:43,649
<font color="yellow">Stop exaggerating.</font>

707
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:45,849
<font color="yellow">This really hurts.</font>

708
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:47,819
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

709
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,149
<font color="yellow">How can you work in a construction site?</font>

710
00:48:50,179 --> 00:48:51,849
<font color="yellow">Do you think anyone can work there?</font>

711
00:48:52,149 --> 00:48:53,819
<font color="yellow">It's a specialized field.</font>

712
00:48:53,919 --> 00:48:57,079
<font color="yellow">It's only for those who worked there for 30 or 40 years.</font>

713
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,849
<font color="yellow">How could you possible work there?</font>

714
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:02,679
<font color="yellow">- Stop talking and let's move. - My goodness.</font>

715
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,119
<font color="yellow">- We can't do this. - What?</font>

716
00:49:08,249 --> 00:49:09,279
<font color="yellow">How will you...</font>

717
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:12,549
<font color="yellow">go down the stairs?</font>

718
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:15,279
<font color="yellow">How will you walk up and down?</font>

719
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,719
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, we have no choice.</font>

720
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:21,849
<font color="yellow">Let's move him back.</font>

721
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:25,549
<font color="yellow">- To where? - I don't know. Let's just move him.</font>

722
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,379
<font color="yellow">- Let's move back. - Please be careful.</font>

723
00:49:27,379 --> 00:49:28,949
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Be careful.</font>

724
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,179
<font color="yellow">- Wait. - Watch out. Move slowly.</font>

725
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:34,449
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

726
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:37,379
<font color="yellow">Aunt, Seong Hoon was discharged from the hospital,</font>

727
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:39,979
<font color="yellow">but he can't go downstairs.</font>

728
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,379
<font color="yellow">Please try to stand more firmly?</font>

729
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,449
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, hold his arm tighter.</font>

730
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:50,279
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Hold on a second.</font>

731
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,649
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Aunt.</font>

732
00:49:53,019 --> 00:49:55,649
<font color="yellow">- Aunt. Move slowly. - Lean on me.</font>

733
00:49:56,379 --> 00:49:57,749
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Be careful.</font>

734
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:00,449
<font color="yellow">Wait, Jeong Ae.</font>

735
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:02,519
<font color="yellow">- Aunt. - Watch your step.</font>

736
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:04,749
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Walk slowly.</font>

737
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,419
<font color="yellow">Good. Slowly.</font>

738
00:50:08,149 --> 00:50:10,779
<font color="yellow">Goodness, what on earth is going on?</font>

739
00:50:10,779 --> 00:50:12,179
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

740
00:50:15,419 --> 00:50:17,519
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Jeong Ae, what's wrong?</font>

741
00:50:17,549 --> 00:50:19,279
<font color="yellow">You're such a useless brat.</font>

742
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:21,679
<font color="yellow">- Stop. - Jeong Ae.</font>

743
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,449
<font color="yellow">- You know he's ill now. - You really drive me crazy.</font>

744
00:50:25,449 --> 00:50:28,519
<font color="yellow">- I can't put up with you any more. - Please calm down.</font>

745
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:31,419
<font color="yellow">- Relax, Jeong Ae. He's ill. - You're a worthless jerk.</font>

746
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:33,979
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

747
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,779
<font color="yellow">- You're a disaster. - Stop.</font>

748
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:52,279
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

749
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:53,979
<font color="yellow">Can we talk?</font>

750
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,449
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

751
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:59,649
<font color="yellow">Can I ask what you're doing?</font>

752
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:03,219
<font color="yellow">I'm studying math. I haven't studied for a while.</font>

753
00:51:04,449 --> 00:51:07,219
<font color="yellow">Really? You really are a good boy.</font>

754
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:11,879
<font color="yellow">I don't even have to nag at you to study. You do it by yourself.</font>

755
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,919
<font color="yellow">You're my boy.</font>

756
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:17,079
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

757
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:19,979
<font color="yellow">by the way,</font>

758
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:21,679
<font color="yellow">as you...</font>

759
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,419
<font color="yellow">are well aware,</font>

760
00:51:27,219 --> 00:51:30,349
<font color="yellow">your dad is injured and staying on the second floor.</font>

761
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:32,049
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

762
00:51:32,779 --> 00:51:34,119
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

763
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:37,049
<font color="yellow">he'll be able to work for a while.</font>

764
00:51:38,249 --> 00:51:39,379
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

765
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,079
<font color="yellow">Sadly, we cannot afford you...</font>

766
00:51:48,149 --> 00:51:51,679
<font color="yellow">any private lessons like how your mom did.</font>

767
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,719
<font color="yellow">I don't think we can afford you. I'm so sorry.</font>

768
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:04,779
<font color="yellow">Do you and Dad want me to stay as the top student...</font>

769
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,549
<font color="yellow">as I have done until now?</font>

770
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:10,349
<font color="yellow">No way. We don't expect...</font>

771
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,579
<font color="yellow">such a big thing from you.</font>

772
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:16,819
<font color="yellow">- Then, what do you expect? - Well...</font>

773
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:21,979
<font color="yellow">We've never expected or wanted anything from our children.</font>

774
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:25,619
<font color="yellow">We just need you to stay healthy...</font>

775
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:27,679
<font color="yellow">and happy.</font>

776
00:52:30,349 --> 00:52:33,379
<font color="yellow">Then, I don't need any private lessons.</font>

777
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:37,079
<font color="yellow">- What? - I can study on my own.</font>

778
00:52:38,519 --> 00:52:41,249
<font color="yellow">If you don't want me to be the top student,</font>

779
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:43,179
<font color="yellow">I can study by myself...</font>

780
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:46,279
<font color="yellow">and become top 10 students.</font>

781
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,349
<font color="yellow">Will it be all right with you?</font>

782
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,779
<font color="yellow">Of course, I am.</font>

783
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:57,319
<font color="yellow">We'll be more than thankful.</font>

784
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:00,749
<font color="yellow">Being top 10 students is such an incredible thing!</font>

785
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,449
<font color="yellow">Then, you don't have to worry about me.</font>

786
00:53:04,579 --> 00:53:05,679
<font color="yellow">I'm totally fine.</font>

787
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,279
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

788
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,519
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

789
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:11,879
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Ji Hoon.</font>

790
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:15,979
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

791
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,349
<font color="yellow">come into my arms.</font>

792
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:22,079
<font color="yellow">Let me hug you.</font>

793
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:25,279
<font color="yellow">But I...</font>

794
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,019
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

795
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:30,819
<font color="yellow">Parents and their children hug often.</font>

796
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:38,879
<font color="yellow">My Ji Hoon.</font>

797
00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:43,119
<font color="yellow">Good boy.</font>

798
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:53,379
<font color="yellow">I went down to the basement, and Ji Hoon was studying math.</font>

799
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,649
<font color="yellow">So you don't have to worry about him.</font>

800
00:53:58,619 --> 00:54:00,279
<font color="yellow">Which part was he studying?</font>

801
00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:02,449
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'd know that?</font>

802
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:11,449
<font color="yellow">So I also figured something out.</font>

803
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:14,349
<font color="yellow">Obviously, I'm not a son...</font>

804
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:18,879
<font color="yellow">who has met your expectations so far, Aunt. I mean, Mom.</font>

805
00:54:19,819 --> 00:54:22,419
<font color="yellow">So, I made a big decision.</font>

806
00:54:22,879 --> 00:54:26,449
<font color="yellow">For the first time, I'll study hard during this winter break.</font>

807
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:29,979
<font color="yellow">Although I ranked 359th last semester,</font>

808
00:54:30,879 --> 00:54:32,579
<font color="yellow">I'll beat three students...</font>

809
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,679
<font color="yellow">and rank 356th...</font>

810
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,049
<font color="yellow">in the next year's first semester.</font>

811
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:40,649
<font color="yellow">So, please don't be depressed...</font>

812
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,579
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Yes?</font>

813
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:46,249
<font color="yellow">Are you joking me?</font>

814
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,119
<font color="yellow">I know every student of your school. One of them...</font>

815
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:55,179
<font color="yellow">flew to the States for golf match on the second day of the exam.</font>

816
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:58,419
<font color="yellow">The other one got caught while cheating.</font>

817
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:01,779
<font color="yellow">And the last one had to leave in the middle of the exam...</font>

818
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:04,549
<font color="yellow">because his grandfather passed away.</font>

819
00:55:05,149 --> 00:55:07,549
<font color="yellow">Even with such advantages, you ranked the bottom.</font>

820
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:12,079
<font color="yellow">You attended every class and took the exams, but ranked the last.</font>

821
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:17,619
<font color="yellow">So how are you going to beat them?</font>

822
00:55:18,419 --> 00:55:20,219
<font color="yellow">Is that even possible?</font>

823
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:24,149
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

824
00:55:28,649 --> 00:55:31,679
<font color="yellow">And why do you eat uncooked food?</font>

825
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:35,749
<font color="yellow">You should cook it first.</font>

826
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:38,549
<font color="yellow">I was going to cook this for breakfast.</font>

827
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,449
<font color="yellow">You're eating it at this late hour, and that's why you've become obese.</font>

828
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:46,779
<font color="yellow">Who gave birth to you?</font>

829
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:50,719
<font color="yellow">You know who did.</font>

830
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:09,449
<font color="yellow">Dad, I really can go on my own.</font>

831
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:12,249
<font color="yellow">You're still not well.</font>

832
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:14,249
<font color="yellow">What if anything happens on your way?</font>

833
00:56:15,149 --> 00:56:16,779
<font color="yellow">Nothing will happen.</font>

834
00:56:16,819 --> 00:56:19,379
<font color="yellow">I'll just accompany you. It's cold.</font>

835
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:26,779
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

836
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:30,279
<font color="yellow">- I'm okay, Dad. - Just stay still.</font>

837
00:56:48,249 --> 00:56:50,419
<font color="yellow">Dad, stop it and have a seat.</font>

838
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:53,619
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

839
00:56:53,979 --> 00:56:56,019
<font color="yellow">They have some tea. Do you want it?</font>

840
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:57,849
<font color="yellow">No thanks. This is enough for me.</font>

841
00:56:58,149 --> 00:56:59,249
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

842
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,749
<font color="yellow">I believe all of you are...</font>

843
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:04,779
<font color="yellow">looking for a reliable business partner...</font>

844
00:57:04,979 --> 00:57:08,249
<font color="yellow">with a profound knowledge and competitive edges.</font>

845
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:09,579
<font color="yellow">(Mustard Chicken)</font>

846
00:57:09,579 --> 00:57:11,519
<font color="yellow">(Sweet Chicken)</font>

847
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:12,579
<font color="yellow">(Boneless Chicken)</font>

848
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:18,749
<font color="yellow">Have a bite.</font>

849
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:25,419
<font color="yellow">Have you run a business before?</font>

850
00:57:25,919 --> 00:57:27,219
<font color="yellow">Penguin...</font>

851
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,579
<font color="yellow">I had a large business once.</font>

852
00:57:34,949 --> 00:57:37,379
<font color="yellow">This will be his second avian business.</font>

853
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:42,779
<font color="yellow">(I love you Dad. Please get well soon.)</font>

854
00:57:49,249 --> 00:57:52,619
<font color="yellow">- Are you having fun, Ah In? - Yes, I'm having fun.</font>

855
00:57:56,879 --> 00:57:59,149
<font color="yellow">Please get well soon, Dad.</font>

856
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,649
<font color="yellow">This is my little girl.</font>

857
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:04,719
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

858
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,279
<font color="yellow">Is there anything else?</font>

859
00:58:12,049 --> 00:58:13,119
<font color="yellow">No, that's all.</font>

860
00:58:14,149 --> 00:58:16,779
<font color="yellow">I heard that beef bone soup is good for fractures.</font>

861
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,019
<font color="yellow">I already ordered bones from the butcher's shop.</font>

862
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:22,579
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

863
00:58:26,179 --> 00:58:27,279
<font color="yellow">I'll open the door.</font>

864
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:31,279
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

865
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,719
<font color="yellow">It's going to take forever.</font>

866
00:58:42,279 --> 00:58:44,449
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy. Dong Hui.</font>

867
00:58:44,919 --> 00:58:48,019
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Can you revise these for me?</font>

868
00:58:53,749 --> 00:58:54,779
<font color="yellow">Can I?</font>

869
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:56,849
<font color="yellow">The writer got fed up with revising, so she just left it to us.</font>

870
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:59,119
<font color="yellow">She's gone off the grid now.</font>

871
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,449
<font color="yellow">We have to fix it and come up with a complete script.</font>

872
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:06,179
<font color="yellow">I think you can manage this.</font>

873
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:08,549
<font color="yellow">But can I...</font>

874
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,749
<font color="yellow">Can you do it or not?</font>

875
00:59:11,049 --> 00:59:13,019
<font color="yellow">I will give it a try, then.</font>

876
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,249
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please do a good job.</font>

877
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:17,649
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

878
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:24,019
<font color="yellow">You're working late.</font>

879
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,619
<font color="yellow">Yes, we're not done with the work yet.</font>

880
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:30,379
<font color="yellow">Where did Director Han go? His phone is turned off.</font>

881
00:59:30,579 --> 00:59:33,449
<font color="yellow">He left for a meeting with a TV station director.</font>

882
00:59:33,819 --> 00:59:35,579
<font color="yellow">That's why he might be out of reach.</font>

883
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,149
<font color="yellow">I see. Then please tell him to come to my office when he returns.</font>

884
00:59:39,149 --> 00:59:40,379
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will do that.</font>

885
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:45,779
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, can I see you?</font>

886
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:48,579
<font color="yellow">Sure.</font>

887
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:50,679
<font color="yellow">So what did you decide?</font>

888
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:53,779
<font color="yellow">Decide what?</font>

889
00:59:53,919 --> 00:59:56,219
<font color="yellow">Last time you came here and we agreed that you will...</font>

890
00:59:56,219 --> 00:59:59,179
<font color="yellow">think about what you should do for Director Han.</font>

891
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:01,549
<font color="yellow">So what did you decide to do?</font>

892
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:08,049
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park was praising that you work very well.</font>

893
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,379
<font color="yellow">I think you decided to stay here...</font>

894
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,079
<font color="yellow">and work hard.</font>

895
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,779
<font color="yellow">You should talk to me. What's wrong with you?</font>

896
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:22,419
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

897
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:23,949
<font color="yellow">Yes, Dong Hui.</font>

898
01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:25,519
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

899
01:00:26,979 --> 01:00:29,349
<font color="yellow">I want to keep working for this company.</font>

900
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:30,719
<font color="yellow">I will try my best.</font>

901
01:00:30,979 --> 01:00:32,819
<font color="yellow">You don't think about Director Han, do you?</font>

902
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:36,449
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for you?</font>

903
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:38,549
<font color="yellow">Since I already started working here,</font>

904
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:42,149
<font color="yellow">I want to work hard so that I can pay for my brother's debt...</font>

905
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:44,819
<font color="yellow">and stop being nuisance to Director Han.</font>

906
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:47,579
<font color="yellow">I am a little smart.</font>

907
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:51,019
<font color="yellow">That sounds like you've chosen to ignore Director Han...</font>

908
01:00:51,019 --> 01:00:52,719
<font color="yellow">and to benefit yourself.</font>

909
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,519
<font color="yellow">Can I consider it like that?</font>

910
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,649
<font color="yellow">Can I understand it like that?</font>

911
01:01:00,819 --> 01:01:03,879
<font color="yellow">Yes. I want to work.</font>

912
01:01:04,349 --> 01:01:05,649
<font color="yellow">Okay, then.</font>

913
01:01:06,149 --> 01:01:09,179
<font color="yellow">A high school graduate like yourself...</font>

914
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:11,649
<font color="yellow">working for our firm is as impossible as...</font>

915
01:01:11,649 --> 01:01:13,219
<font color="yellow">a camel passing through the eye of a needle.</font>

916
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:15,179
<font color="yellow">You can't abandon that chance...</font>

917
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,779
<font color="yellow">for royalty or sense of honor to your in-law.</font>

918
01:01:19,819 --> 01:01:22,619
<font color="yellow">It's not like you've known each other for a long time...</font>

919
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:24,649
<font color="yellow">that you would be willing to take sacrifices for him.</font>

920
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,119
<font color="yellow">After you got off at the apartment in Cheonho-dong,</font>

921
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:30,119
<font color="yellow">I had an argument with Director Han.</font>

922
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:33,979
<font color="yellow">I said your place looked haunted,</font>

923
01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:35,619
<font color="yellow">and he got so upset at me.</font>

924
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:40,279
<font color="yellow">At the time, I didn't get why he was so upset.</font>

925
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:43,119
<font color="yellow">After I found out that you were his in-law,</font>

926
01:01:43,179 --> 01:01:45,219
<font color="yellow">I understood him clearly.</font>

927
01:01:46,949 --> 01:01:49,949
<font color="yellow">Because you are his in-law, I feel bad for you.</font>

928
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,719
<font color="yellow">I am sorry about what I said to you that day.</font>

929
01:01:54,379 --> 01:01:55,519
<font color="yellow">You don't have to be.</font>

930
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:57,349
<font color="yellow">So I prepared something for you.</font>

931
01:02:04,649 --> 01:02:06,179
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

932
01:02:06,449 --> 01:02:07,779
<font color="yellow">It's not a big amount,</font>

933
01:02:08,379 --> 01:02:10,779
<font color="yellow">but it will be enough for you...</font>

934
01:02:10,919 --> 01:02:12,919
<font color="yellow">to move out and get a place to live.</font>

935
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:17,049
<font color="yellow">Do you understand what I am saying?</font>

936
01:02:18,249 --> 01:02:21,449
<font color="yellow">I want you to leave Director Han's house.</font>

937
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:44,349
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

938
01:02:44,349 --> 01:02:45,649
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

939
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:47,249
<font color="yellow">Do you like me?</font>

940
01:02:47,749 --> 01:02:50,149
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, wake up.</font>

941
01:02:50,379 --> 01:02:52,319
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're being too impudent?</font>

942
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,319
<font color="yellow">Why would I go to the basement? It's too small anyway.</font>

943
01:02:55,579 --> 01:02:57,819
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's not see each other, then.</font>

944
01:02:58,019 --> 01:02:59,579
<font color="yellow">I won't see you ever again.</font>

945
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:01,079
<font color="yellow">Are you laughing right now?</font>

946
01:03:01,419 --> 01:03:02,619
<font color="yellow">Should I cry, then?</font>

947
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,719
<font color="yellow">Why are you so upset?</font>

948
01:03:04,979 --> 01:03:06,179
<font color="yellow">Cheer up.</font>

949
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:08,819
<font color="yellow">Merry Christmas.</font>
