<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

159
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:56,598
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

160
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,068
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Ji Hoon. - Hello.</font>

161
00:08:58,068 --> 00:08:59,298
<font color="yellow">Hello, Ah In.</font>

162
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:02,898
<font color="yellow">I will go say hi to Seong Sik and then come back to help you.</font>

163
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:04,398
<font color="yellow">Yes. You should visit Seong Sik's office.</font>

164
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:07,168
<font color="yellow">He was so upset that nobody came to his opening party.</font>

165
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,068
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will be back, then.</font>

166
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:16,968
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

167
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,798
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

168
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,868
<font color="yellow">I guess you are on the way to visit your brother's office.</font>

169
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:24,068
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

170
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,268
<font color="yellow">Well, then.</font>

171
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:35,868
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik.</font>

172
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,168
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik, my little brother.</font>

173
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,338
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late? It hurts.</font>

174
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,298
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I am late. Congratulations.</font>

175
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,538
<font color="yellow">- I hope you thrive. - Thank you.</font>

176
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:49,768
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to bring this.</font>

177
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,898
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have a seat?</font>

178
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,638
<font color="yellow">You're the only one in my family...</font>

179
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,868
<font color="yellow">who truly cares about me.</font>

180
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:06,138
<font color="yellow">So many people sent me flower pots as you can see.</font>

181
00:10:06,668 --> 00:10:09,568
<font color="yellow">And even Director Han of FGC came all the way here...</font>

182
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:10,968
<font color="yellow">to celebrate.</font>

183
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:17,638
<font color="yellow">Did Senior Secretary send you the pot?</font>

184
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:19,638
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik, do you know him well?</font>

185
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,538
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do.</font>

186
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:24,638
<font color="yellow">He counts on me recently.</font>

187
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,738
<font color="yellow">Look, even Seonghan Group sent me a flower pot.</font>

188
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:31,238
<font color="yellow">President Lee really likes me.</font>

189
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:34,238
<font color="yellow">By the way, how did you get close to them?</font>

190
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,708
<font color="yellow">Why? Is there a problem?</font>

191
00:10:37,168 --> 00:10:39,168
<font color="yellow">The collusive links between Minjeong Party...</font>

192
00:10:39,298 --> 00:10:42,338
<font color="yellow">and Seonghan have become an issue these days.</font>

193
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:44,598
<font color="yellow">How timid you are.</font>

194
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:47,138
<font color="yellow">Hey. Great politicians and businessmen...</font>

195
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,568
<font color="yellow">all have little flaws like that.</font>

196
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,598
<font color="yellow">Still, you should be cautious.</font>

197
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:56,838
<font color="yellow">Hey, if you meet them in person, you'd know how nice they are.</font>

198
00:10:57,068 --> 00:10:59,898
<font color="yellow">And if they were that dangerous people,</font>

199
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:01,268
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee wouldn't have introduced them to me.</font>

200
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:04,998
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Lee did? - Yes, the guy next door did.</font>

201
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:08,438
<font color="yellow">Isn't he just running a construction company?</font>

202
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:10,038
<font color="yellow">He does, but that's not all he does.</font>

203
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:13,738
<font color="yellow">I guess it's because of his uncle.</font>

204
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:16,438
<font color="yellow">He has got a lot of connections in various areas.</font>

205
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:19,998
<font color="yellow">He even lend me this office almost for free.</font>

206
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,598
<font color="yellow">I've already got many cases...</font>

207
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,138
<font color="yellow">since he introduced me to everyone he knows.</font>

208
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:27,438
<font color="yellow">I'll be extremely busy right from the beginning.</font>

209
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:33,238
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik, you should be careful.</font>

210
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:35,168
<font color="yellow">There's no such thing as a free lunch.</font>

211
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:39,038
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk and think like a old geezer?</font>

212
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,338
<font color="yellow">You're still very young.</font>

213
00:11:51,268 --> 00:11:52,368
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

214
00:11:53,868 --> 00:11:54,938
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

215
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,738
<font color="yellow">- Are you on your way home? - Yes.</font>

216
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:01,198
<font color="yellow">I had to help my brothers, so I'm a little late today.</font>

217
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,768
<font color="yellow">- There are things to celebrate. - That's right.</font>

218
00:12:06,468 --> 00:12:09,398
<font color="yellow">My brothers told me about you.</font>

219
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:11,438
<font color="yellow">You're helping them a lot.</font>

220
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:15,998
<font color="yellow">Neighbors should help each other out.</font>

221
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:20,238
<font color="yellow">I'll treat you to a nice meal later for my brothers.</font>

222
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,838
<font color="yellow">See you around.</font>

223
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,138
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

224
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:37,938
<font color="yellow">Why don't we...</font>

225
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,938
<font color="yellow">go for drinks now?</font>

226
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:07,798
<font color="yellow">- Do you like drinking? - Although I can't drink a lot,</font>

227
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:10,098
<font color="yellow">I like as much as others do.</font>

228
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,498
<font color="yellow">Let's just talk casually.</font>

229
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:23,738
<font color="yellow">I think we're about the same age.</font>

230
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:25,898
<font color="yellow">You might find me boring.</font>

231
00:13:28,898 --> 00:13:30,898
<font color="yellow">Even my friends call me a nerd...</font>

232
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:34,568
<font color="yellow">and don't want to have drinks with me.</font>

233
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,198
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

234
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:39,798
<font color="yellow">I like you because you're polite and upright.</font>

235
00:13:41,598 --> 00:13:44,338
<font color="yellow">- I'll take it as a compliment. - I really mean it.</font>

236
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:45,798
<font color="yellow">You really look like a good guy.</font>

237
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,268
<font color="yellow">It's all thanks to my parents.</font>

238
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:57,498
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

239
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,938
<font color="yellow">I have a younger brother about your age.</font>

240
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:04,568
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

241
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:10,098
<font color="yellow">I don't think I've seen him.</font>

242
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,868
<font color="yellow">That's right. He's not here.</font>

243
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:23,338
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

244
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,168
<font color="yellow">What do you do on your days off?</font>

245
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,238
<font color="yellow">I usually read books I wanted to read...</font>

246
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,768
<font color="yellow">or monitor the dramas of other channels.</font>

247
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:48,138
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take time off from your busy life?</font>

248
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,898
<font color="yellow">You can go clubbing and meet some girls...</font>

249
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,468
<font color="yellow">before you get old.</font>

250
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,368
<font color="yellow">That's what young people do, right?</font>

251
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:57,798
<font color="yellow">I like it better.</font>

252
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,168
<font color="yellow">I'm enjoying my life to the full.</font>

253
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:03,638
<font color="yellow">Is it because you don't live alone?</font>

254
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:07,898
<font color="yellow">Isn't it uncomfortable to live with your parents?</font>

255
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,938
<font color="yellow">There's no reason to feel that way.</font>

256
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:14,138
<font color="yellow">They've raised me so far.</font>

257
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:21,438
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee,</font>

258
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:25,568
<font color="yellow">thank you so much for helping...</font>

259
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,498
<font color="yellow">my brothers.</font>

260
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,038
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

261
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,238
<font color="yellow">I no longer want my family...</font>

262
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,638
<font color="yellow">to owe you anything.</font>

263
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:46,298
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a big deal at all.</font>

264
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:50,468
<font color="yellow">I just helped them as a neighbor.</font>

265
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,038
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean to offend you.</font>

266
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:57,798
<font color="yellow">Still, I think...</font>

267
00:15:58,338 --> 00:16:01,468
<font color="yellow">my family members can take care of each other...</font>

268
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,238
<font color="yellow">without other's help.</font>

269
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:08,538
<font color="yellow">I guess you really love your family.</font>

270
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:13,668
<font color="yellow">I received a lot of things from them.</font>

271
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:17,438
<font color="yellow">I will never be able to pay them back...</font>

272
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,838
<font color="yellow">for what they've given me.</font>

273
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:23,868
<font color="yellow">You're such a nice son...</font>

274
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,338
<font color="yellow">and a nice brother.</font>

275
00:16:27,398 --> 00:16:29,838
<font color="yellow">You might find me peculiar,</font>

276
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:34,398
<font color="yellow">but my family is all I got.</font>

277
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:36,898
<font color="yellow">They're what I care the most.</font>

278
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:47,138
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

279
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:04,168
<font color="yellow">I already paid for it.</font>

280
00:17:06,338 --> 00:17:08,998
<font color="yellow">I wanted to treat you this time.</font>

281
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:10,798
<font color="yellow">You helped my brothers.</font>

282
00:17:20,368 --> 00:17:23,268
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon! Hyun Woo!</font>

283
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,098
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you should be careful.</font>

284
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:29,668
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

285
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:33,238
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

286
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,738
<font color="yellow">Wait, is it already over?</font>

287
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,768
<font color="yellow">It is. Let's go home.</font>

288
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:41,968
<font color="yellow">No way. They serve great stir-fried chicken feet.</font>

289
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:44,338
<font color="yellow">Let's just have one more dish.</font>

290
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:47,698
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, let's have just one more drink.</font>

291
00:17:48,738 --> 00:17:49,738
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

292
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,338
<font color="yellow">Let's just go home.</font>

293
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,868
<font color="yellow">How can a lady drink every day? Let's get going.</font>

294
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,568
<font color="yellow">I want to drink, too.</font>

295
00:17:57,998 --> 00:18:00,338
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, tell him to listen to me.</font>

296
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,838
<font color="yellow">You can leave. It was nice to see you.</font>

297
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,668
<font color="yellow">I'll take her home.</font>

298
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,538
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you later.</font>

299
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,738
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Jeong Eun. - See you, Seong Joon.</font>

300
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:17,668
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, let's drink later!</font>

301
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,168
<font color="yellow">Gosh, let's go.</font>

302
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:27,298
<font color="yellow">- Let's go for another round. - That's enough.</font>

303
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,268
<font color="yellow">Go inside. Don't despair just because you didn't drink tonight.</font>

304
00:18:33,368 --> 00:18:34,768
<font color="yellow">Have a cup of milk and sleep tight.</font>

305
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,338
<font color="yellow">Why do you smile like that?</font>

306
00:18:41,868 --> 00:18:45,838
<font color="yellow">I walked you home, then you should go in.</font>

307
00:18:47,198 --> 00:18:49,738
<font color="yellow">What do you want from me with that smile?</font>

308
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,698
<font color="yellow">I want you to figure it out. You are not a child.</font>

309
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:03,298
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

310
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:05,538
<font color="yellow">You read that book again.</font>

311
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,738
<font color="yellow">I told you to dump that book right away.</font>

312
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,738
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever feel embarrassed?</font>

313
00:19:12,868 --> 00:19:15,668
<font color="yellow">Life is too short to feel embarrassing.</font>

314
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,038
<font color="yellow">Fine. See you.</font>

315
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,138
<font color="yellow">Go inside. Come on.</font>

316
00:19:23,598 --> 00:19:24,838
<font color="yellow">Go in.</font>

317
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,438
<font color="yellow">It's my mom. She'll kill me if she sees me.</font>

318
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,698
<font color="yellow">A young couple in love...</font>

319
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:54,268
<font color="yellow">Professor Song.</font>

320
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:56,968
<font color="yellow">I got home safely.</font>

321
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,998
<font color="yellow">You put me in a cab.</font>

322
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,368
<font color="yellow">I'm in front of my house.</font>

323
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,568
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

324
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,468
<font color="yellow">The baritone singer tonight.</font>

325
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,468
<font color="yellow">His voice was just charming.</font>

326
00:20:11,438 --> 00:20:14,568
<font color="yellow">As soon as he sang the first verse,</font>

327
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:17,668
<font color="yellow">he caught my ears.</font>

328
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,538
<font color="yellow">His tone was clear.</font>

329
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:22,738
<font color="yellow">What a great singing ability.</font>

330
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:27,968
<font color="yellow">His voice was so rich and he had perfect acting skills.</font>

331
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:31,368
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

332
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:33,068
<font color="yellow">is he married?</font>

333
00:20:33,798 --> 00:20:36,338
<font color="yellow">Then? Is he seeing anyone?</font>

334
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:41,038
<font color="yellow">- She's embarrassing. - He was so attractive.</font>

335
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,038
<font color="yellow">That song.</font>

336
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,838
<font color="yellow">I was completed won over by it.</font>

337
00:20:49,198 --> 00:20:50,438
<font color="yellow">"I Don't Love You Anymore."</font>

338
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:53,768
<font color="yellow">I won't love you anymore.</font>

339
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:45,638
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

340
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,338
<font color="yellow">you take after your mother.</font>

341
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,738
<font color="yellow">She's unstoppable.</font>

342
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:54,438
<font color="yellow">I guess she must have met an amazing baritone singer.</font>

343
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,338
<font color="yellow">She still hasn't learned her lesson.</font>

344
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,298
<font color="yellow">By the way...</font>

345
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:10,838
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that? You're making me cringe.</font>

346
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:14,638
<font color="yellow">I mean it's...</font>

347
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:15,868
<font color="yellow">Go in quickly.</font>

348
00:22:16,398 --> 00:22:18,138
<font color="yellow">It looks like your mother drank a lot.</font>

349
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,938
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. Get home safely.</font>

350
00:22:31,638 --> 00:22:32,668
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

351
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:34,398
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

352
00:22:35,098 --> 00:22:36,138
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

353
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:39,498
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

354
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:54,238
<font color="yellow">Get on it.</font>

355
00:22:56,998 --> 00:22:58,468
<font color="yellow">Get on it.</font>

356
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:00,868
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

357
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:10,138
<font color="yellow">What? How? How is this possible?</font>

358
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:12,768
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong? - Isn't...</font>

359
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:14,398
<font color="yellow">this broken?</font>

360
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:16,998
<font color="yellow">You said you bought this from online yesterday.</font>

361
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,768
<font color="yellow">Losing weight might not be possible,</font>

362
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,638
<font color="yellow">but you worked out without eating.</font>

363
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:24,638
<font color="yellow">Then you shouldn't at least have gained weight.</font>

364
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,538
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

365
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:32,168
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

366
00:23:33,238 --> 00:23:35,098
<font color="yellow">eat something without telling me?</font>

367
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:37,898
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't. There's nothing to eat.</font>

368
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:43,268
<font color="yellow">I don't have any money. You took all my money, Mother.</font>

369
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,998
<font color="yellow">Something's fishy.</font>

370
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:53,638
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry, Mother.</font>

371
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:00,068
<font color="yellow">Okay. You're ready.</font>

372
00:24:01,368 --> 00:24:04,498
<font color="yellow">Ah In, Dad is busy with his restaurant.</font>

373
00:24:04,538 --> 00:24:06,938
<font color="yellow">He can't take you to your preschool.</font>

374
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:10,438
<font color="yellow">So let's leave a bit early with me. Is that okay?</font>

375
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:11,638
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

376
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:14,268
<font color="yellow">My cute baby.</font>

377
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:16,638
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

378
00:24:19,368 --> 00:24:20,398
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

379
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:22,868
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I'm leaving for work.</font>

380
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:24,898
<font color="yellow">Okay. See you.</font>

381
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,798
<font color="yellow">What are you doing this morning?</font>

382
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:29,898
<font color="yellow">I'm studying.</font>

383
00:24:31,538 --> 00:24:32,538
<font color="yellow">Studying?</font>

384
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:38,568
<font color="yellow">It's good to study.</font>

385
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:41,598
<font color="yellow">You're on a winter break. You should have some fun.</font>

386
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,468
<font color="yellow">I can't let this slide.</font>

387
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,968
<font color="yellow">You. Here you go.</font>

388
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:56,398
<font color="yellow">Take this money and don't come home until dark.</font>

389
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:58,398
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

390
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,138
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to go out and have fun.</font>

391
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:03,538
<font color="yellow">What is this? You are supposed to go out and enjoy yourself.</font>

392
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,038
<font color="yellow">You're studying during your winter break.</font>

393
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:06,898
<font color="yellow">I don't...</font>

394
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:09,798
<font color="yellow">have anyone to hang out even if I go out.</font>

395
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:13,568
<font color="yellow">But still. You should go out.</font>

396
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:16,338
<font color="yellow">Close your book. Close it.</font>

397
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:17,898
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

398
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:22,168
<font color="yellow">Today, you must go out.</font>

399
00:25:23,168 --> 00:25:24,268
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

400
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,098
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

401
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:56,968
<font color="yellow">"Our rooster was chased again today."</font>

402
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:05,568
<font color="yellow">"It was when I had lunch and came out to chop the wood."</font>

403
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:20,538
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo!</font>

404
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:22,368
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo!</font>

405
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:29,568
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Mother?</font>

406
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,198
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? When is the breakfast?</font>

407
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:37,898
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

408
00:26:53,468 --> 00:26:56,098
<font color="yellow">Since I was young,</font>

409
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:58,468
<font color="yellow">I always had toasts and coffee for breakfast.</font>

410
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:01,398
<font color="yellow">It was because my father was a high ranking official.</font>

411
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:03,998
<font color="yellow">He often had his breakfast...</font>

412
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,568
<font color="yellow">with foreigners.</font>

413
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:08,468
<font color="yellow">That had an effect on breakfast at home.</font>

414
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:12,238
<font color="yellow">After I got married, there was one time I ran out of coffee.</font>

415
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:15,998
<font color="yellow">I couldn't go out to buy coffee because of my mother-in-law.</font>

416
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:20,038
<font color="yellow">At that time, I could only get it at Hwapyeong department store.</font>

417
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,768
<font color="yellow">I remember that I was in a jam.</font>

418
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:31,638
<font color="yellow">Why don't you have toasts, too?</font>

419
00:27:31,938 --> 00:27:35,168
<font color="yellow">Why would I have that for breakfast? It will turn my stomach.</font>

420
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:39,238
<font color="yellow">You can just drink this coffee.</font>

421
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:44,238
<font color="yellow">I will drink this hot rice water. Enjoy your coffee.</font>

422
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:46,168
<font color="yellow">How can we spend...</font>

423
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:49,168
<font color="yellow">our last years together when we are clearly so different?</font>

424
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,998
<font color="yellow">Why can't we?</font>

425
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:54,168
<font color="yellow">All we have to do is respect each other's preferences.</font>

426
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:57,798
<font color="yellow">So please adapt to my preferences.</font>

427
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:01,668
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Hwang. - What?</font>

428
00:28:06,998 --> 00:28:08,698
<font color="yellow">Try this kimchi.</font>

429
00:28:09,998 --> 00:28:12,738
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - What? Ms. Oh!</font>

430
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:25,768
<font color="yellow">Where are you going this morning?</font>

431
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:28,198
<font color="yellow">What do you mean where? I'm going to work.</font>

432
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:30,998
<font color="yellow">Then, with whom will I spend my day today?</font>

433
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:34,238
<font color="yellow">Spend it with her.</font>

434
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,898
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

435
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:40,268
<font color="yellow">When are you coming home?</font>

436
00:28:40,598 --> 00:28:42,998
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh! My goodness.</font>

437
00:29:01,498 --> 00:29:02,998
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. Are you on your way to work?</font>

438
00:29:03,598 --> 00:29:06,098
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Okay. Have a good day at work.</font>

439
00:29:07,198 --> 00:29:08,198
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

440
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:11,138
<font color="yellow">what will Moong Chi's brother do today?</font>

441
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,138
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

442
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:15,668
<font color="yellow">You said you are not a director anymore.</font>

443
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,238
<font color="yellow">So I don't have to call you by.</font>

444
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:21,368
<font color="yellow">I wondered what Moong Chi's brother will do today.</font>

445
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,538
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

446
00:29:23,568 --> 00:29:27,198
<font color="yellow">I will go and get one step closer to becoming a writer.</font>

447
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:29,198
<font color="yellow">Why don't you comb Moong Chi's hair...</font>

448
00:29:29,498 --> 00:29:31,798
<font color="yellow">since you are free?</font>

449
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:33,568
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

450
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:37,338
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. Hey.</font>

451
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:45,598
<font color="yellow">- When's the breakfast? - I'm cooking it now.</font>

452
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:47,668
<font color="yellow">It's fish.</font>

453
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:49,898
<font color="yellow">That looks delicious.</font>

454
00:29:50,738 --> 00:29:52,668
<font color="yellow">Mother, can I have breakfast, too?</font>

455
00:29:53,198 --> 00:29:55,738
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You, men.</font>

456
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:58,938
<font color="yellow">How will you survive without me?</font>

457
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,038
<font color="yellow">Here you go. Dig in.</font>

458
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:03,768
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the food.</font>

459
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,568
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that for cooking us breakfast.</font>

460
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:11,838
<font color="yellow">By the way, until when are you on your leave?</font>

461
00:30:13,168 --> 00:30:14,398
<font color="yellow">It is...</font>

462
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:17,668
<font color="yellow">Why did you take a leave of absence from the start of the year?</font>

463
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:21,368
<font color="yellow">I understand if it was the end of the year. This was so abrupt.</font>

464
00:30:22,068 --> 00:30:23,468
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by abrupt?</font>

465
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:27,038
<font color="yellow">He worked hard for all that time. He can take a leave of absence.</font>

466
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,798
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me when he doesn't go to work.</font>

467
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,338
<font color="yellow">What's so hard for you?</font>

468
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:37,468
<font color="yellow">I have to cook him three meals a day.</font>

469
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,038
<font color="yellow">I can take care of it.</font>

470
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,668
<font color="yellow">You are his mother. Can't you prepare his meals for him?</font>

471
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:45,538
<font color="yellow">It bothers me to prepare yours, too.</font>

472
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:46,798
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

473
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:52,338
<font color="yellow">By the way, Seong Joon. Are you getting married...</font>

474
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:54,568
<font color="yellow">with the lady who visited us before?</font>

475
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:57,098
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - She came to visit us.</font>

476
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,568
<font color="yellow">You should say either you will marry her or not.</font>

477
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:01,838
<font color="yellow">It's not like you are young.</font>

478
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:06,538
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

479
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:11,898
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo is just a friend and a coworker.</font>

480
00:31:12,298 --> 00:31:14,438
<font color="yellow">- We are not getting married. - What?</font>

481
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:17,468
<font color="yellow">Then why did she come to visit us?</font>

482
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,698
<font color="yellow">It was because...</font>

483
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:23,968
<font color="yellow">we didn't communicate well.</font>

484
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:25,338
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

485
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:31,938
<font color="yellow">Don't take what she said too hard.</font>

486
00:31:32,468 --> 00:31:35,468
<font color="yellow">I completely believe in your decision.</font>

487
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:37,738
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Father.</font>

488
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,538
<font color="yellow">Let's go out and have black bean sauce noodles later.</font>

489
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,868
<font color="yellow">Isn't she being too petty about food?</font>

490
00:31:48,098 --> 00:31:49,898
<font color="yellow">- Cheer up. - Okay.</font>

491
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:02,998
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

492
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,268
<font color="yellow">Writer Jo, that's not true.</font>

493
00:32:09,338 --> 00:32:11,768
<font color="yellow">Director Han is on a business trip overseas.</font>

494
00:32:13,368 --> 00:32:15,098
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you will terminate the contract?</font>

495
00:32:15,568 --> 00:32:17,668
<font color="yellow">Writer Jo. Hello?</font>

496
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:21,868
<font color="yellow">What will we do? Will she terminate the contract?</font>

497
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:25,098
<font color="yellow">It's a serious problem.</font>

498
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:28,768
<font color="yellow">She did wait for a long time considering her personality.</font>

499
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,838
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh. Please bring us the contract.</font>

500
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:34,838
<font color="yellow">Where is Ms. Oh?</font>

501
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:37,698
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh. What happened with his proposal?</font>

502
00:32:38,838 --> 00:32:39,968
<font color="yellow">Did she go somewhere?</font>

503
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,168
<font color="yellow">What is everyone looking for her?</font>

504
00:32:43,698 --> 00:32:46,398
<font color="yellow">Is she an important part of this office?</font>

505
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:50,168
<font color="yellow">Okay. Look for Director Han instead of Ms. Oh.</font>

506
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:53,338
<font color="yellow">We are about to be ruined.</font>

507
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:55,838
<font color="yellow">She's coming in late today.</font>

508
00:32:56,238 --> 00:32:57,298

<font color="yellow">Something amazing will happen to her today.</font>

510

<font color="yellow">- What is it? - What is it?</font>

511
00:33:01,738 --> 00:33:03,738
<font color="yellow">- Did she catch Seo Cheol Min? - Is she getting married?</font>

512
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:06,298

572
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:17,368
<font color="yellow">She's temperamental and grumpy.</font>

579

580
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:42,368
<font color="yellow">your resignation letter thinking you tied up loose ends.</font>

581
00:37:42,568 --> 00:37:43,768
<font color="yellow">From our perspective,</font>

582
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:47,138

583
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,568
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, our business will be ruined.</font>

584

<font color="yellow">will lose their job overnight.</font>

586
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:57,768
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

587
00:37:58,698 --> 00:37:59,698
<font color="yellow">are you going...</font>

588
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,668
<font color="yellow">to keep being stubborn?</font>

589
00:38:09,698 --> 00:38:11,038
<font color="yellow">You're so arrogant.</font>

590
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:14,168
<font color="yellow">He resigned from our company?</font>

591
00:38:14,698 --> 00:38:16,138
<font color="yellow">What will you do with him?</font>

592
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:20,938
<font color="yellow">What do you mean what I will do? We will let him work.</font>

593
00:38:21,238 --> 00:38:22,808
<font color="yellow">Later I will find something on him...</font>

594
00:38:23,308 --> 00:38:24,968
<font color="yellow">and send him to jail.</font>

595

<font color="yellow">All sorts of things happen when you produce a drama.</font>

596
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:33,738
<font color="yellow">I'm going to teach him a lesson.</font>

597
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:37,238
<font color="yellow">I'm going to put him to work...</font>

598
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:41,238
<font color="yellow">and later, I will make sure that he ends up in jail.</font>

599
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:44,068
<font color="yellow">That was arrogant of him.</font>

600
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,538
<font color="yellow">How dare he act like that?</font>

601
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:55,968
<font color="yellow">- Let go. - Com here.</font>

602
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:58,138
<font color="yellow">You are pushing it. Get in the car.</font>

603

<font color="yellow">What do you...</font>

612
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,338
<font color="yellow">like about Lee Hyun Woo?</font>

613
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:06,468
<font color="yellow">Why are you bringing this up?</font>

614
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,368
<font color="yellow">I was just curious.</font>

615
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:13,398
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

616
00:40:13,898 --> 00:40:15,598
<font color="yellow">he's such a good person.</font>

617
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:19,638
<font color="yellow">No, he is a good person.</font>

618
00:40:20,468 --> 00:40:22,268
<font color="yellow">You got him wrong.</font>

619
00:40:26,698 --> 00:40:27,808
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

620
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:29,598
<font color="yellow">this is a secret.</font>

621
00:40:30,198 --> 00:40:33,438
<font color="yellow">I met him in New York three years ago.</font>

622
00:40:34,238 --> 00:40:36,438
<font color="yellow">I've been watching him ever since.</font>

623
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,368
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

624
00:40:39,668 --> 00:40:43,498
<font color="yellow">At the time, he was the CEO of an investment bank on Wall Street.</font>

625
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:46,868
<font color="yellow">He's now lost everything.</font>

626
00:40:48,768 --> 00:40:51,068
<font color="yellow">He's one of those people who instantly became rich...</font>

627
00:40:51,068 --> 00:40:53,168
<font color="yellow">with stocks and then lost everything.</font>

628
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:56,068
<font color="yellow">But he's a good person. He's very good-hearted.</font>

629
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,268
<font color="yellow">He treats me well,</font>

630
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:01,498
<font color="yellow">and he rented me this place for a fraction of the cost.</font>

631
00:41:01,898 --> 00:41:03,098
<font color="yellow">Did he do that to you, too?</font>

632
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:05,338
<font color="yellow">Yes. Why?</font>

633
00:41:08,138 --> 00:41:09,168
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

634
00:41:51,638 --> 00:41:53,398
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I am sorry.</font>

635
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:12,968
<font color="yellow">- You're here again. - Yes.</font>

636
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,138
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

637
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,538
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - You're here.</font>

638
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,668
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy. - Thank you.</font>

639
00:42:24,338 --> 00:42:26,868
<font color="yellow">I have to pick up Ah In. I'm late.</font>

640
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:38,868
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

641
00:42:41,538 --> 00:42:42,598
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

642
00:42:46,308 --> 00:42:47,768
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

643
00:42:50,038 --> 00:42:51,038
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

644
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,268
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

645
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:57,898
<font color="yellow">Have you been here all day?</font>

646
00:42:58,308 --> 00:42:59,368
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

647
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:01,998
<font color="yellow">You told me to play outside.</font>

648
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:04,698
<font color="yellow">But I haven't done this before,</font>

649
00:43:05,498 --> 00:43:07,538
<font color="yellow">so I didn't know what to do.</font>

650
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:10,968
<font color="yellow">I didn't know where to go.</font>

651
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:16,038
<font color="yellow">Did you do this whenever I told you to play outside?</font>

652
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:19,068
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

653
00:43:20,368 --> 00:43:21,898
<font color="yellow">Is it that hard to play?</font>

654
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:25,308
<font color="yellow">I really don't know how to play.</font>

655
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,938
<font color="yellow">I feel more at ease when I study.</font>

656
00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:30,868
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

657
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:34,598
<font color="yellow">Please don't tell me to go out and play.</font>

658
00:43:35,338 --> 00:43:36,398
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

659
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:43,398
<font color="yellow">What should I do with you?</font>

660
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:44,968
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

661
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:48,068
<font color="yellow">- Please give me a lot. - Thank you.</font>

662
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:49,468
<font color="yellow">- Eat a lot. - Okay.</font>

663
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:51,598
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

664
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:54,338
<font color="yellow">- Please give me a lot. - Eat a lot.</font>

665
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,798
<font color="yellow">- Are you here to eat, too? - Yes.</font>

666
00:44:07,498 --> 00:44:08,738
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

667
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:14,938
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo!</font>

668
00:44:19,938 --> 00:44:21,938
<font color="yellow">Come on. Come on.</font>

669
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,538
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's that about?</font>

670
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,598
<font color="yellow">He went to get a free meal and got caught.</font>

671
00:44:37,898 --> 00:44:39,098
<font color="yellow">Free meal?</font>

672
00:44:39,868 --> 00:44:40,998
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

673
00:44:41,138 --> 00:44:43,398
<font color="yellow">- Who went there? - Who do you think it is?</font>

674
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,938
<font color="yellow">It's the person who we both know.</font>

675
00:44:47,138 --> 00:44:50,068
<font color="yellow">Are you in your right mind?</font>

676
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:52,238
<font color="yellow">Why would you go there to get food?</font>

677
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:55,338
<font color="yellow">Stop hitting me. It hurts.</font>

678
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,568
<font color="yellow">How can I not hit you right now?</font>

679
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:00,938
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

680
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,338
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard to make you work out.</font>

681
00:45:03,538 --> 00:45:05,998
<font color="yellow">I got you those expensive beans...</font>

682
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,868
<font color="yellow">and made you lose weight.</font>

683
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,638
<font color="yellow">And how could you go to a soup kitchen?</font>

684
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:17,768
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's where you can just go and get food?</font>

685
00:45:17,868 --> 00:45:21,238
<font color="yellow">That place is for people who can't afford to...</font>

686
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:23,938
<font color="yellow">feed themselves. That's where they get free food.</font>

687
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,568
<font color="yellow">It's not where you go because you can't control your appetite.</font>

688
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:30,668
<font color="yellow">Do you understand?</font>

689
00:45:33,168 --> 00:45:35,698
<font color="yellow">Goodness. It's too much.</font>

690
00:45:36,168 --> 00:45:39,268
<font color="yellow">How can Chang Soo go to the soup kitchen?</font>

691
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:42,898
<font color="yellow">Gosh. He's a clever boy, isn't he?</font>

692
00:45:43,798 --> 00:45:47,198
<font color="yellow">It's not the time to worry about Chang Soo.</font>

693
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:49,538
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

694
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:53,398
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is just as in trouble, too.</font>

695
00:45:54,098 --> 00:45:55,298
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

696
00:45:55,668 --> 00:45:58,168
<font color="yellow">I told him to play outside,</font>

697
00:45:58,468 --> 00:46:00,868
<font color="yellow">and he sat in the playground all day...</font>

698
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,568
<font color="yellow">and thought about what to do.</font>

699
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:04,538
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

700
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:05,968
<font color="yellow">If I were him,</font>

701
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:09,198
<font color="yellow">I'd think while riding the swing.</font>

702
00:46:14,568 --> 00:46:15,638
<font color="yellow">Honey,</font>

703
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:19,338
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is in serious trouble.</font>

704
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:22,998
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo got hungry, so he came up with the soup kitchen idea.</font>

705
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:25,268
<font color="yellow">He can think creatively at least.</font>

706
00:46:26,038 --> 00:46:27,498
<font color="yellow">Is that something to be proud about?</font>

707
00:46:28,098 --> 00:46:29,938
<font color="yellow">No, but it's true.</font>

708
00:46:32,368 --> 00:46:36,038
<font color="yellow">Of course, Chang Soo's actions are quite off the wall,</font>

709
00:46:36,468 --> 00:46:38,198
<font color="yellow">but who would think like that?</font>

710
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:40,268
<font color="yellow">Only Chang Soo can think like that.</font>

711
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:44,168
<font color="yellow">But Ji Hoon doesn't even know how to play.</font>

712
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,068
<font color="yellow">Don't you think that's a bigger problem?</font>

713
00:46:47,798 --> 00:46:50,268
<font color="yellow">So? Where did Ji Hoon go now?</font>

714
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:53,738
<font color="yellow">I told him to go up to Seong Joon's room.</font>

715
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:55,098
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

716
00:46:55,138 --> 00:46:57,798
<font color="yellow">I told him to go there and think about what he really wants to do.</font>

717
00:46:57,798 --> 00:46:59,568
<font color="yellow">I told him to write a bucket list.</font>

718
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:00,798
<font color="yellow">What list?</font>

719
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:02,798
<font color="yellow">You know.</font>

720
00:47:03,098 --> 00:47:06,238
<font color="yellow">It's a list of all the things you want to do in life.</font>

721
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:21,038
<font color="yellow">You. Listen carefully.</font>

722
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,798
<font color="yellow">You are grounded from now on.</font>

723
00:47:25,398 --> 00:47:26,538
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

724
00:47:26,738 --> 00:47:28,398
<font color="yellow">You are grounded until the school resumes.</font>

725
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:29,668
<font color="yellow">You can't go anywhere.</font>

726
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,798
<font color="yellow">The only time you can leave...</font>

727
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:34,068
<font color="yellow">is when you are exercising with me.</font>

728
00:47:34,168 --> 00:47:35,398
<font color="yellow">That's the only time. Okay?</font>

729
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:36,898
<font color="yellow">Study now.</font>

730
00:47:37,168 --> 00:47:38,168
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

731
00:47:40,968 --> 00:47:44,038
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever think about escaping like in "The Shawshank Redemption"!</font>

732
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:48,568
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

733
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:14,338
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

734
00:48:19,498 --> 00:48:21,138
<font color="yellow">Did you look for a place?</font>

735
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,838
<font color="yellow">Is this about that child from Home of Angels?</font>

736
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,568
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think I shouldn't ignore it.</font>

737
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:33,098
<font color="yellow">Maybe you can make her the information desk clerk...</font>

738
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:35,138
<font color="yellow">at Golden Street Korea Branch.</font>

739
00:48:35,168 --> 00:48:36,168
<font color="yellow">I will do that.</font>

740
00:48:37,568 --> 00:48:39,738
<font color="yellow">Is there any more information about Han Seong Joon?</font>

741
00:48:40,538 --> 00:48:43,538
<font color="yellow">Within the FGC Group, everyone knows that...</font>

742
00:48:43,768 --> 00:48:46,868
<font color="yellow">he is engaged to the chairman's only daughter.</font>

743
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:50,098
<font color="yellow">But despite the rumor, he recently resigned.</font>

744
00:48:52,298 --> 00:48:53,938
<font color="yellow">He's got some nerve.</font>

745
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:55,898
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

00:48:57,098 --> 00:48:59,268

<font color="yellow">How did you get in?</font>

764
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,098
<font color="yellow">The front door was open.</font>

775
00:50:39,038 --> 00:50:42,938
<font color="yellow">He helped me a lot since I was in New York.</font>

776
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:46,168
<font color="yellow">He formed a habit of calling me that.</font>

777
00:50:46,498 --> 00:50:48,968
<font color="yellow">He still calls me that from time to time.</font>

778
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:53,998
<font color="yellow">Are you saying he was your subordinate back then?</font>

779
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,068
<font color="yellow">Well, kind of.</font>

780
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:02,368
<font color="yellow">You were so rich and successful.</font>

781
00:51:03,098 --> 00:51:04,538
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry things turned out this way.</font>

782
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:07,968
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

783
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:11,598
<font color="yellow">Are you sorry that I'm not rich anymore?</font>

784
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:13,698
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean that.</font>

785
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:17,238
<font color="yellow">I just don't want people to say that you are...</font>

786
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:19,238
<font color="yellow">living off your uncle at least.</font>

787
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,198
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry. Let's eat.</font>

788
00:51:25,638 --> 00:51:28,998
<font color="yellow">Let's eat kimchi stew today. The old-fashioned kimchi stew.</font>

789
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:32,998
<font color="yellow">Do you know how to make it?</font>

790
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:37,538
<font color="yellow">Of course not. I bought it from a great restaurant nearby.</font>

791
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:39,838
<font color="yellow">I'll fix the meal today. All I have to do is boil it.</font>

792
00:51:53,598 --> 00:51:54,598
<font color="yellow">Oh, goodness.</font>

793
00:51:55,268 --> 00:51:57,398
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Oh, my.</font>

794
00:52:02,298 --> 00:52:03,338
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so scared.</font>

795
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:11,568
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness!</font>

796
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:24,568
<font color="yellow">Are you really scared?</font>

797
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:29,798
<font color="yellow">Or did the book say you should pretend to be scared?</font>

798
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:33,368
<font color="yellow">We picked a wrong movie today.</font>

799
00:52:33,368 --> 00:52:35,498
<font color="yellow">I easily get frightened.</font>

800
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:40,168
<font color="yellow">You said the movie had a twist. You didn't say it was a horror movie.</font>

801
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:44,438
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

802
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:54,868
<font color="yellow">If you get frightened so easily,</font>

803
00:52:55,398 --> 00:52:58,598
<font color="yellow">how did you go around the world and sleep out in the open?</font>

804
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:00,598
<font color="yellow">That's different.</font>

805
00:53:01,768 --> 00:53:04,398
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What should I do?</font>

806
00:53:05,238 --> 00:53:06,538
<font color="yellow">I'll get it.</font>

807
00:53:07,338 --> 00:53:10,938
<font color="yellow">What should I do? Why don't you just take it off?</font>

808
00:53:10,998 --> 00:53:12,738
<font color="yellow">- You should... - No, it's fine.</font>

809
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:21,598
<font color="yellow">What? Are you going to say I'm being silly?</font>

810
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,038
<font color="yellow">- No. - What, then?</font>

811
00:53:26,198 --> 00:53:27,868
<font color="yellow">Am I clumsy?</font>

812
00:53:31,968 --> 00:53:32,998
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

813
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:36,738
<font color="yellow">Are you always...</font>

814
00:53:37,738 --> 00:53:39,598
<font color="yellow">this careless?</font>

815
00:53:40,098 --> 00:53:41,098
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

816
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:44,998
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You're offending me.</font>

817
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:49,068
<font color="yellow">It looks like you believe...</font>

818
00:53:49,998 --> 00:53:53,098
<font color="yellow">everything people tell you like a little child.</font>

819
00:53:53,468 --> 00:53:55,938
<font color="yellow">Of course I believe what people tell me.</font>

820
00:53:55,938 --> 00:53:57,738
<font color="yellow">Should I doubt them first?</font>

821
00:53:57,938 --> 00:54:00,638
<font color="yellow">Once I decide to trust someone,</font>

822
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:03,968
<font color="yellow">I believe whatever the person says, even if it's obviously a lie.</font>

823
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:05,898
<font color="yellow">You have to be loyal.</font>

824
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:15,998
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at me like that? We're alone.</font>

825
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:19,268
<font color="yellow">You're not getting any wrong ideas, are you?</font>

826
00:54:22,698 --> 00:54:25,168
<font color="yellow">Oh, goodness. I should run away!</font>

827
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,298
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

828
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:35,638
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

829
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,868
<font color="yellow">The starts are beautiful.</font>

830
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,998
<font color="yellow">I really like this place although it's not as good as...</font>

831
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:53,038
<font color="yellow">the rooftop of my grandma's house.</font>

832
00:54:55,098 --> 00:54:56,898
<font color="yellow">You said you were scared. Are you okay?</font>

833
00:54:57,838 --> 00:54:59,468
<font color="yellow">I have you, Hyun Woo.</font>

834
00:55:00,938 --> 00:55:04,368
<font color="yellow">My goodness. My mom is so cute.</font>

835
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:07,868
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even look at me now that she's living with Ms. Oh.</font>

836
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,938
<font color="yellow">It'd be good for me if I don't have to come here anymore.</font>

837
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,498
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Is she out of her mind?</font>

838
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:28,368
<font color="yellow">Aren't you cold?</font>

839
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:31,298
<font color="yellow">- I'm cold. - Do you need a blanket?</font>

840
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:33,368
<font color="yellow">I brought one.</font>

841
00:55:34,468 --> 00:55:35,938
<font color="yellow">That'd be great.</font>

842
00:55:45,398 --> 00:55:46,398
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

843
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:50,568
<font color="yellow">Get down here.</font>

844
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:55,968
<font color="yellow">I saw everything. You'd better get down here now.</font>

845
00:55:57,438 --> 00:56:00,338
<font color="yellow">Sit down. We have to hide. Hurry.</font>

846
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:07,898
<font color="yellow">- It's too late. - You should come down, too.</font>

847
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,968
<font color="yellow">Me... Me?</font>

848
00:56:13,238 --> 00:56:15,098
<font color="yellow">Get down here, both of you!</font>

849
00:56:20,138 --> 00:56:22,398
<font color="yellow">- You little... What are you doing? - Mom.</font>

850
00:56:22,468 --> 00:56:23,638
<font color="yellow">- What do you think you're doing? - Mom.</font>

851
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:25,968
<font color="yellow">Why didn't that guy come down with you?</font>

852
00:56:26,298 --> 00:56:29,098
<font color="yellow">Mom. Let's talk when we get at home, okay?</font>

853
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,068
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font>

854
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:33,538
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Just get in. Come on.</font>

855
00:56:33,538 --> 00:56:35,938
<font color="yellow">- Let go of me. - All right. Let's get in.</font>

856
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:38,938
<font color="yellow">Let's talk at home.</font>

857
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,198
<font color="yellow">Writer Jo.</font>

858
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:00,668
<font color="yellow">Hello, Producer Kim.</font>

859
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:03,068
<font color="yellow">How have you been, Writer Jo?</font>

860
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:06,338
<font color="yellow">Good, of course. I've always been great.</font>

861
00:57:06,868 --> 00:57:09,198
<font color="yellow">- Hello. Welcome. - Hello. Welcome.</font>

862
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:12,168
<font color="yellow">All right. Hello.</font>

863
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:15,368
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Jo Jeong Sook. It's nice to meet you.</font>

864
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:18,668
<font color="yellow">It's an honor to finally meet you. I'm Park Jin Sang.</font>

865
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:21,898
<font color="yellow">Director Bang. Writer Jo is here.</font>

866
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:23,668
<font color="yellow">Please hurry.</font>

867
00:57:25,768 --> 00:57:26,768
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

868
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:30,138
<font color="yellow">your office is so messy.</font>

869
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:36,468
<font color="yellow">I think it stinks a bit, too.</font>

870
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:39,598
<font color="yellow">Open the windows. Open them now.</font>

871
00:57:40,338 --> 00:57:42,998
<font color="yellow">You're not ready to welcome me at all.</font>

872
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,498
<font color="yellow">It's not that. It's just...</font>

873
00:57:45,568 --> 00:57:47,968
<font color="yellow">the air is polluted these days, so...</font>

874
00:57:47,968 --> 00:57:49,368
<font color="yellow">Hello, Writer Jo.</font>

875
00:57:50,198 --> 00:57:53,298
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. What a pretty lady.</font>

876
00:57:55,768 --> 00:57:58,938
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Director Han Seong Joon?</font>

877
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:02,168
<font color="yellow">I said I don't want to work with anyone but him.</font>

878
00:58:02,538 --> 00:58:05,468
<font color="yellow">Bring Director Han right now.</font>

879
00:58:05,738 --> 00:58:07,098
<font color="yellow">Now!</font>

880
00:58:16,168 --> 00:58:18,898
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Director Han. You're here.</font>

881
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:24,468
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's been such a long time.</font>

882
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,038
<font color="yellow">- It's good to see you again. - You, too.</font>

883
00:58:28,398 --> 00:58:29,568
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

884
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:43,038
<font color="yellow">What's your name?</font>

885
00:58:43,598 --> 00:58:46,098
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's Oh Dong Hui.</font>

886
00:58:46,538 --> 00:58:48,898
<font color="yellow">You look like a very nice lady.</font>

887
00:58:49,698 --> 00:58:52,438
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Thank you for the tea.</font>

888
00:58:53,168 --> 00:58:54,598
<font color="yellow">Sure. Thank you.</font>

889
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:07,698
<font color="yellow">None of this makes sense.</font>

890
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:11,268
<font color="yellow">We all agreed to work together. You should stick it out until the end.</font>

891
00:59:11,368 --> 00:59:13,168
<font color="yellow">If the staff suddenly changes in the middle,</font>

892
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:17,538
<font color="yellow">it's hard to achieve the objective we set at the beginning.</font>

893
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:20,368
<font color="yellow">- Don't you agree, Director Han? - I'm sorry.</font>

894
00:59:20,838 --> 00:59:23,298
<font color="yellow">We're not playing a game here.</font>

895
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,998
<font color="yellow">Also, how could you try to dump me...</font>

896
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:29,538
<font color="yellow">on some other guys?</font>

897
00:59:29,598 --> 00:59:33,468
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but Director Han didn't try to dump you on other guys.</font>

898
00:59:33,768 --> 00:59:35,638
<font color="yellow">I need you to stay out of this.</font>

899
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:38,538
<font color="yellow">I really don't like you.</font>

900
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:40,198
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

901
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:42,498
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

902
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:46,338
<font color="yellow">we made a deal, so you should take responsibility to the end.</font>

903
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:48,298
<font color="yellow">I won't let it slide just because you're handsome!</font>

904
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:53,038
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

905
00:59:53,538 --> 00:59:55,268
<font color="yellow">I will fulfill the promise.</font>

906
00:59:56,898 --> 00:59:58,098
<font color="yellow">We are sorry.</font>

907
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:12,668
<font color="yellow">Thank you for coming back, Seong Joon.</font>

908
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:16,138
<font color="yellow">Before I decided to return, I made a few promises with the president.</font>

909
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:18,338
<font color="yellow">Firstly,</font>

910
01:00:18,768 --> 01:00:21,498
<font color="yellow">my return doesn't mean that I'll marry you.</font>

911
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:22,968
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

912
01:00:23,038 --> 01:00:24,098
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

913
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:26,838
<font color="yellow">I will lead the Contents Team...</font>

914
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:30,398
<font color="yellow">and produce only good dramas not commercial ones.</font>

915
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:32,598
<font color="yellow">That's what I want.</font>

916
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:35,938
<font color="yellow">I will work with competent directors and writers...</font>

917
01:00:36,238 --> 01:00:37,968
<font color="yellow">regardless of their backgrounds.</font>

918
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:41,468
<font color="yellow">I'll select only quality scenarios with literacy value.</font>

919
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:44,638
<font color="yellow">Why don't you decide that after you finish Writer Jo's work...</font>

920
01:00:44,638 --> 01:00:46,138
<font color="yellow">successfully?</font>

921
01:00:47,198 --> 01:00:48,238
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

922
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:51,898
<font color="yellow">I will put over the drama no matter what.</font>

923
01:00:53,038 --> 01:00:54,038
<font color="yellow">I know...</font>

924
01:00:54,638 --> 01:00:56,898
<font color="yellow">you and other staff members went through a lot because of me.</font>

925
01:00:56,968 --> 01:00:58,868
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to make up for it.</font>

926

931
01:01:11,538 --> 01:01:14,138
<font color="yellow">I won't cling to you anymore.</font>

932
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,298

935
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:26,338
<font color="yellow">I don't want to mention her, but Dong Hui is the same.</font>

936
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:30,038
<font color="yellow">We all should pull ourselves together and work really hard.</font>

937
01:01:30,568 --> 01:01:32,098
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to survive.</font>

01:01:42,968 --> 01:01:44,138
<font color="yellow">How about you, Ji Hoon?</font>

942
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:45,938
<font color="yellow">It's amazing. I'm so excited.</font>

943
01:01:46,438 --> 01:01:47,598
<font color="yellow">That's great.</font>

944
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:50,138
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, why don't we come out every day like this?</font>

945
01:01:50,138 --> 01:01:51,168
<font color="yellow">That sounds good.</font>

946

949
01:02:15,538 --> 01:02:17,438

950
01:02:18,298 --> 01:02:20,968
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm really exhausted.</font>

951
01:02:21,368 --> 01:02:23,968
<font color="yellow">I hadn't eaten anything. I'm studying all day long.</font>

952
01:02:25,598 --> 01:02:27,198
<font color="yellow">The vacation is almost over.</font>

953
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:31,068
<font color="yellow">You must improve something before the semester starts.</font>

954
01:02:31,538 --> 01:02:34,668
<font color="yellow">But I'm so hungry and burned out.</font>

955
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:37,538
<font color="yellow">I'm too hungry to focus on studying.</font>

956
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:40,398
<font color="yellow">It's tasty.</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes, it's so delicious.</font>

961
01:02:55,868 --> 01:02:59,498

<font color="yellow">My former mom never let me eat junk food...</font>

963
