00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:10,174
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

3
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:11,874
<font color="yellow">Watch out.</font>

4
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,244
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my mother?</font>

5
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:22,745
<font color="yellow">It's a long story.</font>

6
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:28,475
<font color="yellow">Look at you, calling her your mother.</font>

7
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,545
<font color="yellow">Do you know what I did...</font>

8
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:35,885
<font color="yellow">so that I can feed you a fried chicken?</font>

9
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:40,445
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Bring me a glass of cold water.</font>

10
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:42,645
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

11
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:52,975
<font color="yellow">Hey. Sit down.</font>

12
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,675
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hee Sook.</font>

13
00:00:55,975 --> 00:01:00,145
<font color="yellow">Why are you so disheartened? Don't let them bother you.</font>

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:01,445
<font color="yellow">Don't.</font>

15
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:05,775
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't care about...</font>

16
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,275
<font color="yellow">what they said about you.</font>

17
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,975
<font color="yellow">If you care, it's your loss, not theirs. Okay?</font>

18
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,245
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

19
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:19,215
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee Sook. Wake up. Come on, Hee Sook.</font>

20
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:22,715
<font color="yellow">Kids get as smart as their moms.</font>

21
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:24,745
<font color="yellow">Someone here turned out to be...</font>

22
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:26,515
<font color="yellow">a local university graduate,</font>

23
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:28,615
<font color="yellow">but she could put on airs thanks to her fake son.</font>

24
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:32,745
<font color="yellow">That's right! Han Chang Soo, the one who gets the worse grades...</font>

25
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,845
<font color="yellow">is my son.</font>

26
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:38,175
<font color="yellow">I'm Chang Soo's mother. What are you going to do?</font>

27
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,015
<font color="yellow">It's late.</font>

28
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,645
<font color="yellow">Why isn't he home?</font>

29
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:16,515
<font color="yellow">Is he still on his hike?</font>

30
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,415
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Yes?</font>

31
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:22,815
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

32
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:23,845
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

33
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:28,915
<font color="yellow">I must be heavy. Put me down.</font>

34
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:30,575
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

35
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,415
<font color="yellow">Dad, I'm carrying you on my back, and...</font>

36
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:36,015
<font color="yellow">You're asleep.</font>

37
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,145
<font color="yellow">Sir! Please.</font>

38
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,815
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me this one time.</font>

39
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:22,075
<font color="yellow">I have two young children.</font>

40
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:24,915
<font color="yellow">- I can't go to jail like this. - My goodness.</font>

41
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:27,015
<font color="yellow">They will starve to death.</font>

42
00:03:27,015 --> 00:03:29,815
<font color="yellow">Hey, you let someone else's child die.</font>

43
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:31,245
<font color="yellow">And you're worrying about your own children?</font>

44
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,715
<font color="yellow">They are better off without you.</font>

45
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,115
<font color="yellow">What a scum.</font>

46
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,275
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

47
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:40,115
<font color="yellow">Go home.</font>

48
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:43,275
<font color="yellow">Go home. Until the result comes out,</font>

49
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:45,575
<font color="yellow">wait at home and think about what you did.</font>

50
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,245
<font color="yellow">You are an alcoholic scum.</font>

51
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,345
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir.</font>

52
00:03:57,845 --> 00:03:58,945
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

53
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,445
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

54
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,215
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

55
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:41,045
<font color="yellow">Let's go home, Hyun Woo.</font>

56
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,375
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

57
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,015
<font color="yellow">You can take a good care of Sang Woo, right?</font>

58
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:56,285
<font color="yellow">Yes, I can.</font>

59
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:01,315
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

60
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:05,145
<font color="yellow">Don't leave him behind next time.</font>

61
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,475
<font color="yellow">Understood?</font>

62
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,015
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

63
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,145
<font color="yellow">Don't look. Close your eyes, Sang Woo.</font>

64
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:17,015
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, what's wrong with Dad?</font>

65
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:19,785
<font color="yellow">I can't see anything.</font>

66
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:22,745
<font color="yellow">No, you can't. You can't look at him now.</font>

67
00:05:23,285 --> 00:05:25,915
<font color="yellow">Don't look at him, Sang Woo.</font>

68
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,145
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Let go of me. Let go.</font>

69
00:06:02,815 --> 00:06:03,875
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

70
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,775
<font color="yellow">It's over. Everything's over now.</font>

71
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,445
<font color="yellow">I won't let it stand.</font>

72
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:12,275
<font color="yellow">I'm going to destroy everything. Let go of me.</font>

73
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,145
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir!</font>

74
00:06:19,845 --> 00:06:22,175
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, I am here.</font>

75
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,915
<font color="yellow">- Sir. - Let go!</font>

76
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:28,515
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

77
00:06:29,145 --> 00:06:30,475
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

78
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,315
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

79
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:35,715
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

80
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,515
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo. Hyun Woo!</font>

81
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:40,345
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Woo. - Jeong Eun's here.</font>

82
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:41,715
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him?</font>

83
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,515
<font color="yellow">Why is he so upset?</font>

84
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,675
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun's here. Calm down. Calm down!</font>

85
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,515
<font color="yellow">Your foot is...</font>

86
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:51,945
<font color="yellow">bleeding.</font>

87
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:52,975
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

88
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:55,815
<font color="yellow">Will you go to the pharmacy?</font>

89
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,875
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

90
00:07:03,745 --> 00:07:05,245
<font color="yellow">Please, sir.</font>

91
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,845
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself.</font>

92
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,775
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun saw what happened.</font>

93
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,215
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

94
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,545
<font color="yellow">I'm too tired.</font>

95
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:22,415
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.</font>

96
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:24,345
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

97
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,215
<font color="yellow">I can't take my revenge...</font>

98
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,475
<font color="yellow">this way.</font>

99
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,475
<font color="yellow">They look after each other, care for each other,</font>

100
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:36,945
<font color="yellow">and enjoy themselves.</font>

101
00:07:38,515 --> 00:07:40,145
<font color="yellow">I can't watch it anymore.</font>

102
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:44,015
<font color="yellow">Let's just destroy Seong Hoon and Seong Sik,</font>

103
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:46,745
<font color="yellow">break down their house,</font>

104
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,115
<font color="yellow">and go back to the States.</font>

105
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,245
<font color="yellow">I cannot...</font>

106
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,445
<font color="yellow">contain my anger any longer.</font>

107
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:04,445
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you talking?</font>

108
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:07,745
<font color="yellow">I said we will destroy them and return to the States.</font>

109
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:11,175
<font color="yellow">They killed my father.</font>

110
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:14,845
<font color="yellow">I can't watch them living a happy life.</font>

111
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:16,945
<font color="yellow">Sir, you came up...</font>

112
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:19,445
<font color="yellow">with this plan first.</font>

113
00:08:21,315 --> 00:08:24,145
<font color="yellow">I wanted an elaborate and brutal plan.</font>

114
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:27,375
<font color="yellow">I wanted to destroy them one by one.</font>

115
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:28,675
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

116
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,845
<font color="yellow">I gave you clues.</font>

117
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,315
<font color="yellow">Just like Gatsby who moved into a house across his lover's house,</font>

118
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:36,885
<font color="yellow">I helped you move into the house across Hyung Seop's house.</font>

119
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:39,015
<font color="yellow">That's driving me crazy.</font>

120
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:42,885
<font color="yellow">I have to witness how happily they are living,</font>

121
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,815
<font color="yellow">while I am all alone.</font>

122
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:48,845
<font color="yellow">My father's death...</font>

123
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:51,215
<font color="yellow">and my brother's disappearance.</font>

124
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:54,545
<font color="yellow">I'm about to go crazy with the nightmares...</font>

125
00:08:54,545 --> 00:08:56,245
<font color="yellow">I have every night.</font>

126
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,045
<font color="yellow">How can they be so happy?</font>

127
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,045
<font color="yellow">The harder I drive them to the corner,</font>

128
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,215
<font color="yellow">the more they love and support each other.</font>

129
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,115
<font color="yellow">You should swallow your anger.</font>

130
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:13,345
<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

131
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:17,015
<font color="yellow">I want to kill them right now.</font>

132
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:22,915
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

133
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,445
<font color="yellow">Before that, there is something you should know.</font>

134
00:09:29,715 --> 00:09:30,915
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

135
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,315
<font color="yellow">Han Seong Joon, the youngest son of Han Hyung Seop...</font>

136
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,545
<font color="yellow">isn't a child Hyung Seop had with another woman.</font>

137
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,715
<font color="yellow">He brought Seong Joon from an orphanage.</font>

138
00:09:44,345 --> 00:09:45,975
<font color="yellow">I heard it today.</font>

139
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,385
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

140
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,815
<font color="yellow">What I find weird is the fact...</font>

141
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:55,045
<font color="yellow">that they adopted him.</font>

142
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:57,615
<font color="yellow">They adopted him when Sang Woo had gone missing.</font>

143
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,885
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

144
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:10,015
<font color="yellow">I don't want to believe it,</font>

145
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,245
<font color="yellow">but we should consider every possibility.</font>

146
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:16,385
<font color="yellow">I found out where the orphanage is.</font>

147
00:10:17,045 --> 00:10:19,415
<font color="yellow">I'll visit there tomorrow morning.</font>

148
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:22,745
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun will visit you with a medicine and a bandage.</font>

149
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,845
<font color="yellow">She'll treat you.</font>

150
00:10:25,345 --> 00:10:26,975
<font color="yellow">Please be nice to her like her real boyfriend.</font>

151
00:10:27,415 --> 00:10:28,675
<font color="yellow">We're almost there.</font>

152
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:31,675
<font color="yellow">Please be patient a little longer.</font>

153
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:34,415
<font color="yellow">I'll be leaving.</font>

154
00:10:58,545 --> 00:11:00,345
<font color="yellow">I will not ask you anything.</font>

155
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:04,475
<font color="yellow">I won't ask why you did something you'd never done before...</font>

156
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:09,175
<font color="yellow">or if you have more secrets you're hiding from me.</font>

157
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,675
<font color="yellow">I'll ask nothing.</font>

158
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:12,815
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

159
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:15,815
<font color="yellow">I want you to tell me about it later.</font>

160
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:19,715
<font color="yellow">I want to know...</font>

161
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,645
<font color="yellow">how your father encountered the wrongful death,</font>

162
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:26,345
<font color="yellow">how you'd lost your brother,</font>

163
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:29,375
<font color="yellow">and what happened to you tonight.</font>

164
00:11:31,515 --> 00:11:32,745
<font color="yellow">Tell me about these later.</font>

165
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,015
<font color="yellow">It's done.</font>

166
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,145
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to stay with you?</font>

167
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,715
<font color="yellow">No. You can leave.</font>

168
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:48,645
<font color="yellow">I want to be alone.</font>

169
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,815
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll go, then.</font>

170
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,345
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

171
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,115
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

172
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:51,645
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

173
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,545
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much?</font>

174
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,845
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to you?</font>

175
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:09,975
<font color="yellow">I'm so worried.</font>

176
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:15,815
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work?</font>

177
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:19,115
<font color="yellow">Yes. How is Dad?</font>

178
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:22,945
<font color="yellow">Spare me some time.</font>

179
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,875
<font color="yellow">We need to talk.</font>

180
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:28,545
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

181
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:36,675
<font color="yellow">Why did...</font>

182
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:40,115
<font color="yellow">your dad drink so hard yesterday?</font>

183
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:43,775
<font color="yellow">- Do you know why? - I don't.</font>

184
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:46,815
<font color="yellow">He called me, so I went to pick him up.</font>

185
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:49,215
<font color="yellow">I really have no clue at all.</font>

186
00:13:50,145 --> 00:13:54,145
<font color="yellow">He hadn't drunk like that for the last 10 years.</font>

187
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,745
<font color="yellow">He got dead drunk when he voluntarily retired from work.</font>

188
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:02,415
<font color="yellow">Since then, he'd never drunk so heavily like yesterday.</font>

189
00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:07,115
<font color="yellow">And he even kept screaming all night long...</font>

190
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,245
<font color="yellow">and apologizing to someone.</font>

191
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:14,675
<font color="yellow">Last night was an utter nightmare.</font>

192
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,915
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

193
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,515
<font color="yellow">Does anything come to your mind?</font>

194
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,645
<font color="yellow">So I slept on it.</font>

195
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:30,445
<font color="yellow">Nothing special happened to our family these days.</font>

196
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:33,245
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon and Seong Sik opened a restaurant and an office...</font>

197
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,375
<font color="yellow">respectively.</font>

198
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,645
<font color="yellow">And Ji Hoon and Chang Soo...</font>

199
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:40,545
<font color="yellow">got used to their new lives.</font>

200
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,245
<font color="yellow">There's nothing...</font>

201
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,675
<font color="yellow">your dad would be worried about.</font>

202
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,915
<font color="yellow">If there is,</font>

203
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:50,745
<font color="yellow">it should be you.</font>

204
00:14:52,345 --> 00:14:54,915
<font color="yellow">- Me... Me? - Yes.</font>

205
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:57,175
<font color="yellow">I think it's about your marriage.</font>

206
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:00,815
<font color="yellow">I asked you to get back...</font>

207
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:06,015
<font color="yellow">with that rich lady the other day, and your dad yelled at me.</font>

208
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:09,215
<font color="yellow">He told me to just let you handle it on your own.</font>

209
00:15:10,815 --> 00:15:11,815
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

210
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,875
<font color="yellow">Maybe,</font>

211
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:18,845
<font color="yellow">he thinks...</font>

212
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:23,175
<font color="yellow">he should find your birth mother before you get married.</font>

213
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,445
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Seong Joon.</font>

214
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,345
<font color="yellow">I don't mean to hurt your feeling.</font>

215
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:33,815
<font color="yellow">But we all know the truth,</font>

216
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,375
<font color="yellow">so let's make it clear this time.</font>

217
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,875
<font color="yellow">Have you ever...</font>

218
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:44,575
<font color="yellow">tried to find your birth mother?</font>

219
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,415
<font color="yellow">I haven't.</font>

220
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:48,375
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

221
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:55,975
<font color="yellow">It's you who has raised me so far.</font>

222
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:57,975
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

223
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:02,145
<font color="yellow">I have no plan to find anyone else other than you.</font>

224
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,475
<font color="yellow">That's what I think and I won't change my mind.</font>

225
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,675
<font color="yellow">Okay. I am sorry.</font>

226
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:19,575
<font color="yellow">I guess it was a meaningless question.</font>

227
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,475
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

228
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,645
<font color="yellow">as your brothers moved back in,</font>

229
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:28,545
<font color="yellow">and you've reached a marriageable age.</font>

230
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:31,175
<font color="yellow">I'm confused with all the complicated thoughts.</font>

231
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:35,215
<font color="yellow">This time, your father came home heavily drunk.</font>

232
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,475
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

233
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:40,645
<font color="yellow">I feel heavy with unnecessary worries.</font>

234
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:43,045
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

235
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,145
<font color="yellow">You'd better leave now.</font>

236
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,545
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

237
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,545
<font color="yellow">They are such evil women.</font>

238
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,975
<font color="yellow">Why do they talk about which college others went to?</font>

239
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,215
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

240
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,645
<font color="yellow">Moms who love their kids too much are so problematic.</font>

241
00:17:11,585 --> 00:17:15,645
<font color="yellow">That's why people point fingers at them,</font>

242
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:17,445
<font color="yellow">calling them selfish moms.</font>

243
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:19,015
<font color="yellow">You're totally right.</font>

244
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:23,945
<font color="yellow">Mothers must change in order to make the better world.</font>

245
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:27,245
<font color="yellow">Think about it. The ones who give the greatest affection...</font>

246
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,275
<font color="yellow">to their children are parents.</font>

247
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:31,615
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

248
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:35,045
<font color="yellow">But fathers go to work and come home late at night.</font>

249
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,175
<font color="yellow">Then, who would the kids spend the most time with?</font>

250
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,015
<font color="yellow">Of course, it's their mothers.</font>

251
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:42,615
<font color="yellow">Exactly. But those mothers...</font>

252
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,545
<font color="yellow">are so emulous and selfish.</font>

253
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,515
<font color="yellow">They pay too much attention to their kids...</font>

254
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:50,675
<font color="yellow">and even tell them to become the best...</font>

255
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:54,045
<font color="yellow">and even to trample others to succeed in life.</font>

256
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:56,945
<font color="yellow">Imagine what kind of people they'll grow into.</font>

257
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:01,045
<font color="yellow">Our future will be so gloomy.</font>

258
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:05,085
<font color="yellow">You've learned a great lesson...</font>

259
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:08,215
<font color="yellow">from other mothers of the moms' get-together.</font>

260
00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:11,815
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Yes?</font>

261
00:18:13,445 --> 00:18:15,345
<font color="yellow">- I'm in trouble. - Why?</font>

262
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:20,015
<font color="yellow">- I'm the president. - What?</font>

263
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:23,475
<font color="yellow">I'm the president of the moms' get-together.</font>

264
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:25,645
<font color="yellow">Why did you say yes?</font>

265
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,445
<font color="yellow">You just criticized them harshly.</font>

266
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:32,715
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I had no choice because Ji Hoon is the top student.</font>

267
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,345
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

268
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:36,875
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

269
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,775
<font color="yellow">Don't let it get you down.</font>

270
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,915
<font color="yellow">Just let them make fun of us and speak ill of us.</font>

271
00:18:44,045 --> 00:18:45,645
<font color="yellow">They'll forget about it in a few days.</font>

272
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:50,175
<font color="yellow">We're doomed.</font>

273
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,845
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

274
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,545
<font color="yellow">We should move...</font>

275
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,375
<font color="yellow">- to other town. - Stop such nonsense!</font>

276
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,845
<font color="yellow">Where would we move?</font>

277
00:19:04,315 --> 00:19:05,715
<font color="yellow">I don't care if it's Gangbuk,</font>

278
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,915
<font color="yellow">Gangdong, or Gangseo.</font>

279
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,615
<font color="yellow">Let's just leave Gangnam.</font>

280
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,475
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

281
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:14,715
<font color="yellow">go back to that school.</font>

282
00:19:14,715 --> 00:19:15,775
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

283
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,815
<font color="yellow">I have things to do here in Gangnam.</font>

284
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:20,345
<font color="yellow">What do you have to do?</font>

285
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:22,645
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get into Seoul National University or what?</font>

286
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:26,015
<font color="yellow">Are the schools all you can think of?</font>

287
00:19:26,845 --> 00:19:28,045
<font color="yellow">What is Gangnam famous for?</font>

288
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,645
<font color="yellow">It is the heart of politics.</font>

289
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,475
<font color="yellow">It's the center of new trends.</font>

290
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,375
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

291
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:41,215
<font color="yellow">I am...</font>

292
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,045
<font color="yellow">going to get into politics.</font>

293
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,245
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be nominated for...</font>

294
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,315
<font color="yellow">the Seocho district special election.</font>

295
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:52,045
<font color="yellow">- That's nonsense. - It makes sense.</font>

296
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,875
<font color="yellow">Who will support you?</font>

297
00:19:56,915 --> 00:19:59,245
<font color="yellow">There is someone who is willing to support me.</font>

298
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,945
<font color="yellow">So stop obsessing over your child...</font>

299
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:03,915
<font color="yellow">and pay more attention to your husband.</font>

300
00:20:04,175 --> 00:20:06,645
<font color="yellow">I can't make you the mother of a valedictorian,</font>

301
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,675
<font color="yellow">but who knows? Maybe in 10 years,</font>

302
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,045
<font color="yellow">I will make you the first lady.</font>

303
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,945
<font color="yellow">Stop the nonsense. Who's going to vote for you?</font>

304
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,115
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't they vote for me?</font>

305
00:20:17,445 --> 00:20:19,915
<font color="yellow">I'm a lawyer, and I have experience in broadcasting.</font>

306
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,145
<font color="yellow">I'm the perfect candidate.</font>

307
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,445
<font color="yellow">Do you think they won't dig your private life?</font>

308
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:25,845
<font color="yellow">They will find out that our child was switched...</font>

309
00:20:25,915 --> 00:20:28,675
<font color="yellow">and also that he ranks number 359 in his class.</font>

310
00:20:29,015 --> 00:20:30,585
<font color="yellow">Who would vote for you?</font>

311
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,545
<font color="yellow">You are unbelievable.</font>

312
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:35,175
<font color="yellow">Why are you so obsessed with your child?</font>

313
00:20:35,545 --> 00:20:37,175
<font color="yellow">If you are so worried about Chang Soo,</font>

314
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:40,245
<font color="yellow">you can find his other talent.</font>

315
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:41,675
<font color="yellow">What talent does he have?</font>

316
00:20:42,345 --> 00:20:45,515
<font color="yellow">What talent do you think he has?</font>

317
00:20:45,515 --> 00:20:46,845
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

318
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:48,815
<font color="yellow">What if he doesn't have a talent?</font>

319
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:53,645
<font color="yellow">Make him play Korean wrestling.</font>

320
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:55,875
<font color="yellow">Then he would at least have a nice body.</font>

321
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:58,585
<font color="yellow">He can be a Korean champion wrestler.</font>

322
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:00,415
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

323
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:02,245
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

324
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,915
<font color="yellow">The color looks amazing.</font>

325
00:21:22,085 --> 00:21:24,115
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Dong Hui.</font>

326
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,045
<font color="yellow">- And congratulations. - Thank you.</font>

327
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:29,175
<font color="yellow">So we're getting this because...</font>

328
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:30,645
<font color="yellow">your script got chosen.</font>

329
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:32,345
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Let's clap for her.</font>

330
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:38,775
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Let's try this drink first.</font>

331
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,745
<font color="yellow">I am going to eat the rice cake, too.</font>

332
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:49,815
<font color="yellow">Maybe, he thinks...</font>

333
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:51,715
<font color="yellow">he should find your birth mother before you get married.</font>

334
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,575
<font color="yellow">Have you ever...</font>

335
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:58,475
<font color="yellow">tried to find your birth mother?</font>

336
00:22:12,975 --> 00:22:14,545
<font color="yellow">- Director Han. - Rice cake.</font>

337
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,145
<font color="yellow">Eat some rice cake.</font>

338
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:20,645
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. Enjoy.</font>

339
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:22,975
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui...</font>

340
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:25,645
<font color="yellow">bought it because her script got chosen.</font>

341
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:30,015
<font color="yellow">What are you doing right now?</font>

342
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:34,515
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui brought us these homemade omija drink...</font>

343
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:37,345
<font color="yellow">to celebrate her win on a drama script contest.</font>

344
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,075
<font color="yellow">It's very delicious.</font>

345
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:43,415
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

346
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,345
<font color="yellow">It's slightly more than ours.</font>

347
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:51,575
<font color="yellow">- Did anyone talk to Writer Jo? - I talked to her.</font>

348
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,945
<font color="yellow">She said she doesn't want to be bothered because she's working.</font>

349
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,975
<font color="yellow">But she was supposed to pass us some documents.</font>

350
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:58,645
<font color="yellow">Did she say anything else?</font>

351
00:22:58,815 --> 00:22:59,945
<font color="yellow">No, she didn't.</font>

352
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:02,245
<font color="yellow">Is that right? Okay.</font>

353
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,645
<font color="yellow">Ventilate the room after you're done eating.</font>

354
00:23:04,745 --> 00:23:06,475
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't eat in the office.</font>

355
00:23:10,245 --> 00:23:11,945
<font color="yellow">By the way, where did Director Han go?</font>

356
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,845
<font color="yellow">Didn't you meet him? He just left.</font>

357
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:15,945
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

358
00:23:16,575 --> 00:23:18,245
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Director Bang.</font>

359
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:21,275
<font color="yellow">Please take the drink. She brought it for you.</font>

360
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:22,715
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will take it.</font>

361
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:25,445
<font color="yellow">But please don't ruin the atmosphere...</font>

362
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:27,745
<font color="yellow">to celebrate something personal.</font>

363
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:34,245
<font color="yellow">She's so mean.</font>

364
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:37,845
<font color="yellow">Why can't she just take the gift?</font>

365
00:23:38,975 --> 00:23:40,775
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

366
00:23:41,375 --> 00:23:43,815
<font color="yellow">This omija drink tastes great.</font>

367
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:47,075
<font color="yellow">Does your grandmother make things like...</font>

368
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,515
<font color="yellow">soy sauce, doenjang, gochujang, too?</font>

369
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:51,775
<font color="yellow">I mean, with her own recipe. Does she make?</font>

370
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,875
<font color="yellow">Yes. She used to run a grocery store,</font>

371
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,975
<font color="yellow">so she makes everything.</font>

372
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:58,175
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

373
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:02,075
<font color="yellow">Can you bring me some?</font>

374
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:06,445
<font color="yellow">My wife always feeds me store-bought doenjang.</font>

375
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:09,245
<font color="yellow">I miss the taste of homemade doenjang.</font>

376
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,715
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will get you some.</font>

377
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:17,875
<font color="yellow">(Orphanage)</font>

378
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,645
<font color="yellow">I clearly remember him.</font>

379
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,975
<font color="yellow">Because of some traumatic experience,</font>

380
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,345
<font color="yellow">he couldn't even remember his age and name.</font>

381
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:46,015
<font color="yellow">When the police brought him over,</font>

382
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:47,815
<font color="yellow">his voice was hoarse from crying so much.</font>

383
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:55,415
<font color="yellow">How soon did he get adopted?</font>

384
00:24:55,915 --> 00:24:59,215
<font color="yellow">He was adopted within a month.</font>

385
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,675
<font color="yellow">As soon as he came,</font>

386
00:25:01,675 --> 00:25:05,045
<font color="yellow">he chose that boy and signed him for adoption.</font>

387
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:09,345
<font color="yellow">It was as if he was taking a boy he used to know.</font>

388
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,615
<font color="yellow">Which police station was he sent from?</font>

389
00:25:16,245 --> 00:25:18,815
<font color="yellow">It says he was sent from Seocho Police Station.</font>

390
00:25:19,415 --> 00:25:21,775
<font color="yellow">Is that where you lost the boy?</font>

391
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,375
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

392
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,615
<font color="yellow">He was sent here from Seocho Police Station.</font>

393
00:25:30,775 --> 00:25:32,575
<font color="yellow">I need to find the person who first found him.</font>

394
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:35,575
<font color="yellow">- Please look for him. - Okay.</font>

395
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:56,115
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

396
00:25:56,645 --> 00:25:57,875
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

397
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,445
<font color="yellow">Is this a woman problem?</font>

398
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:01,745
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

399
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,045
<font color="yellow">Then what is it?</font>

400
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,475
<font color="yellow">The woman problem is the only problem that should...</font>

401
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:06,745
<font color="yellow">make you look that grim at your age.</font>

402
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:15,215
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

403
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,975
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

404
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:20,775
<font color="yellow">Do you remember...</font>

405
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,275
<font color="yellow">when I first came to the house?</font>

406
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:23,615
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

407
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:25,675
<font color="yellow">When what?</font>

408
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,145
<font color="yellow">I asked if you remember...</font>

409
00:26:28,145 --> 00:26:30,745
<font color="yellow">the first time I came to our house.</font>

410
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:32,675
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

411
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,615
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking that all of a sudden?</font>

412
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:43,915
<font color="yellow">It's just...</font>

413
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:48,375
<font color="yellow">I thought you might remember something.</font>

414
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:54,475
<font color="yellow">I don't remember anything special about that time.</font>

415
00:26:55,675 --> 00:26:58,345
<font color="yellow">One day, Uncle Hyung Seop brought you on his back...</font>

416
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:00,215
<font color="yellow">and said that you were his son.</font>

417
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,245
<font color="yellow">Grandma and aunt collapsed,</font>

418
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:05,115
<font color="yellow">and the house was a mess.</font>

419
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:07,145
<font color="yellow">I remember that, too.</font>

420
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:09,445
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - But...</font>

421
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:13,675
<font color="yellow">I don't remember...</font>

422
00:27:14,445 --> 00:27:16,275
<font color="yellow">anything else.</font>

423
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:21,545
<font color="yellow">I remember a few scenes,</font>

424
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,815
<font color="yellow">but I don't know if they are real.</font>

425
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:28,915
<font color="yellow">I feel frustrated.</font>

426
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,115
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You've been doing so well.</font>

427
00:27:32,975 --> 00:27:34,815
<font color="yellow">Is something really wrong?</font>

428
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:50,375
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

429
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:56,415
<font color="yellow">How's your feet? Are you okay?</font>

430
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,945
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

431
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,445
<font color="yellow">Give me some coffee.</font>

432
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,675
<font color="yellow">I will. Please wait...</font>

433
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:10,875
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

434
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:13,715
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

435
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:20,045
<font color="yellow">Can I sit with you and drink some coffee?</font>

436
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:32,915
<font color="yellow">Did you...</font>

437
00:28:33,775 --> 00:28:35,245
<font color="yellow">return to the company?</font>

438
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,115
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

439
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:41,175
<font color="yellow">I could have introduced you to...</font>

440
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,115
<font color="yellow">a better job.</font>

441
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,975
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - You don't like me.</font>

442
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,175
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you before?</font>

443
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,075
<font color="yellow">Don't hate me too much.</font>

444
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:57,575
<font color="yellow">You never know what will happen in life.</font>

445
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,115
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ji Yeon.</font>

446
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:16,175
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

447
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:18,845
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

448
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:22,275
<font color="yellow">Ji Yeon said she's doing well at her work.</font>

449
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:24,775
<font color="yellow">She asked if she could come and see you at night.</font>

450
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,875
<font color="yellow">Tell her she can.</font>

451
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,945
<font color="yellow">Okay. He said you can come.</font>

452
00:29:33,545 --> 00:29:34,775
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

453
00:29:37,015 --> 00:29:40,515
<font color="yellow">You saw her in front of the motel. Her name is Park Ji Yeon.</font>

454
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:44,315
<font color="yellow">She grew up in the orphanage, Home of Angels.</font>

455
00:29:45,175 --> 00:29:47,745
<font color="yellow">When the children in the orphanage turn 19 years old,</font>

456
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,775
<font color="yellow">they have to leave the orphanage...</font>

457
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:53,515
<font color="yellow">with 500 dollars from the local government.</font>

458
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:57,145
<font color="yellow">With that money, they can't even rent a room.</font>

459
00:29:57,975 --> 00:30:01,475
<font color="yellow">That's how most of them end up working in bars and clubs.</font>

460
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,075
<font color="yellow">They are again bound to face misfortunes.</font>

461
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:08,845
<font color="yellow">Misfortunes will repeat.</font>

462
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,215
<font color="yellow">Eventually,</font>

463
00:30:12,315 --> 00:30:13,515
<font color="yellow">misfortunes will be passed down.</font>

464
00:30:17,075 --> 00:30:20,245
<font color="yellow">I apologize if I misunderstood you...</font>

465
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:23,745
<font color="yellow">and this is a heartbreaking story.</font>

466
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,915
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

467
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,475
<font color="yellow">what's your purpose of telling me?</font>

468
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:31,715
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to.</font>

469
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,645
<font color="yellow">I just wanted...</font>

470
00:30:36,845 --> 00:30:38,975
<font color="yellow">you to know how I felt.</font>

471
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:51,345
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you two?</font>

472
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:56,375
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

473
00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,945
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, I will get going now.</font>

474
00:31:00,745 --> 00:31:01,815
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

475
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:08,115
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

476
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,415
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

477
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:39,745
<font color="yellow">What's going on? What were you two talking about so seriously?</font>

478
00:31:40,745 --> 00:31:41,815
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

479
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,875
<font color="yellow">I'll come back later.</font>

480
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:49,315
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

481
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:52,515
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

482
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:55,745
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

483
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:02,145
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo!</font>

484
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:10,315
<font color="yellow">Hey. Jeong Eun.</font>

485
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,145
<font color="yellow">If you have something to talk about, talk to me tomorrow.</font>

486
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,715
<font color="yellow">I even closed early because I'm tired.</font>

487
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:23,375
<font color="yellow">What did you do to Professor Park you met the other day?</font>

488
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:27,675
<font color="yellow">I told you that I didn't want to go on a blind date.</font>

489
00:32:27,675 --> 00:32:31,615
<font color="yellow">Do you know how talented and smart he is? He comes from a good family.</font>

490
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,515
<font color="yellow">Of course not, but...</font>

491
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:38,815
<font color="yellow">Your status has been falling since you're dating someone like him.</font>

492
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:41,275
<font color="yellow">If you date someone who works at the construction site,</font>

493
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,115
<font color="yellow">- you will have a hard life, too. - Mom.</font>

494
00:32:45,215 --> 00:32:49,015
<font color="yellow">You didn't like him because of his occupation?</font>

495
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,715
<font color="yellow">Yes. That played a part.</font>

496
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:55,645
<font color="yellow">It didn't play a part. It's solely because of it.</font>

497
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:57,515
<font color="yellow">- What? - You lived like a princess...</font>

498
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,715
<font color="yellow">all your life.</font>

499
00:32:59,915 --> 00:33:02,515
<font color="yellow">You only played the piano and didn't do anything else.</font>

500
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:05,915
<font color="yellow">You lived in that world of classical music for all your life.</font>

501
00:33:06,415 --> 00:33:07,915
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

502
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:11,515
<font color="yellow">Do you think I introduced him because he plays classical music?</font>

503
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:14,745
<font color="yellow">- His personality is... - Don't lie.</font>

504
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:16,915
<font color="yellow">You just...</font>

505
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:20,245
<font color="yellow">wanted to introduce someone who resembles Dad.</font>

506
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:22,375
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

507
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:24,415
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if you deny it.</font>

508
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:27,215
<font color="yellow">You can't let go of him all your life.</font>

509
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:30,575
<font color="yellow">On the outside, you pretend you hate, despise, and are mad at him.</font>

510
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:33,775
<font color="yellow">But you've been in his shadow all your life, Mom.</font>

511
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,075
<font color="yellow">That's why you introduced that baritone singer.</font>

512
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,115
<font color="yellow">What a terrible wench.</font>

513
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:45,045
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't say somethings to your mother even if I am your mother.</font>

514
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:48,375
<font color="yellow">You know what kind of life I had.</font>

515
00:33:48,375 --> 00:33:50,075
<font color="yellow">How could you say such things?</font>

516
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,245
<font color="yellow">I'm so bored.</font>

517
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:10,745
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she home? When will she come home?</font>

518
00:34:11,075 --> 00:34:12,415
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

519
00:34:17,245 --> 00:34:18,345
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

520
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:21,815
<font color="yellow">You're not a kid. Why are you acting up?</font>

521
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,415
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I am hanging up.</font>

522
00:34:24,675 --> 00:34:27,675
<font color="yellow">I will be home. I will try to finish work as soon as possible.</font>

523
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:33,175
<font color="yellow">What a baby.</font>

524
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,675
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me, Ma'am. - Yes?</font>

525
00:34:41,485 --> 00:34:43,715
<font color="yellow">Don't you recognize me?</font>

526
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,075
<font color="yellow">Well, I am not sure.</font>

527
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,145
<font color="yellow">How could...</font>

528
00:34:50,745 --> 00:34:53,715
<font color="yellow">an old grandma like me know a rich lady like you?</font>

529
00:34:54,215 --> 00:34:56,145
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

530
00:34:56,745 --> 00:35:00,015
<font color="yellow">didn't you work as a cook at Hwashin Company's President's house?</font>

531
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:01,815
<font color="yellow">Aren't I right?</font>

532
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:06,715
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Ms. Oh.</font>

533
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:09,615
<font color="yellow">How can you quit so suddenly?</font>

534
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:12,615
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I've got a situation.</font>

535
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:15,515
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh!</font>

536
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,845
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Ms. Oh. Are you okay?</font>

537
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:26,745
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

538
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:29,485
<font color="yellow">I have to put the ointment so that it doesn't leave a scar.</font>

539
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,575
<font color="yellow">When we go out...</font>

540
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:34,615
<font color="yellow">with the bruise like this, people think that we will die soon.</font>

541
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,915
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

542
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,915
<font color="yellow">Both of our husbands are dead.</font>

543
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,115
<font color="yellow">The bruise couldn't have come from them or a fight.</font>

544
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,775
<font color="yellow">They will think it happened because...</font>

545
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,275
<font color="yellow">you are old and your legs gave way.</font>

546
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:52,485
<font color="yellow">That's why they will think you might die soon.</font>

547
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:58,575
<font color="yellow">The age spots don't come from anywhere.</font>

548
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,915
<font color="yellow">They come from bruise like this.</font>

549
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:04,515
<font color="yellow">I told you to come home early and hang out with me. Listen to me.</font>

550
00:36:05,175 --> 00:36:08,175
<font color="yellow">Don't move. Stay still.</font>

551
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:09,275
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

552
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:11,245
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

553
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,375
<font color="yellow">What's the matter?</font>

554
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:19,375
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

555
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,485
<font color="yellow">I can't live because of Jeong Eun. She's breaking my heart.</font>

556
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,775
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri.</font>

557
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,645
<font color="yellow">Mom. She deeply...</font>

558
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,985
<font color="yellow">hurt my feelings. She said hurtful words to break my heart.</font>

559
00:36:34,415 --> 00:36:36,715
<font color="yellow">Mom, I am so disappointed.</font>

560
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:39,415
<font color="yellow">What? I'm going to talk to her.</font>

561
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:41,345
<font color="yellow">How dare she hurt my daughter?</font>

562
00:36:42,945 --> 00:36:46,945
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri, don't cry. If you cry, then I'll be sad, too.</font>

563
00:36:47,575 --> 00:36:49,075
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

564
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,345
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri. Calm down.</font>

565
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:54,875
<font color="yellow">Let's calm down.</font>

566
00:36:56,775 --> 00:36:59,175
<font color="yellow">- You're home. - Hello.</font>

567
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,415
<font color="yellow">By the way, this is for you.</font>

568
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:05,175
<font color="yellow">An employee gave me this. You can have it.</font>

569
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,315
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

570
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:23,275
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

571
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,215
<font color="yellow">I was looking at pictures of Grandmother.</font>

572
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:31,245
<font color="yellow">- Why? It's so out of the blue. - It's not.</font>

573
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:33,875
<font color="yellow">I always have her pictures in my room like this.</font>

574
00:37:37,645 --> 00:37:40,775
<font color="yellow">You told me to be responsible and do my duties as an owner.</font>

575
00:37:41,145 --> 00:37:43,045
<font color="yellow">That's why I was looking at the pictures.</font>

576
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:47,715
<font color="yellow">She built the company all on her own as a woman.</font>

577
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:51,545
<font color="yellow">With her energy, I want to be evaluated as a capable director...</font>

578
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:55,575
<font color="yellow">this year although I won't be as capable as she was.</font>

579
00:37:56,515 --> 00:37:59,215
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It's nothing.</font>

580
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,515
<font color="yellow">I was just wondering how you were getting along with Director Han.</font>

581
00:38:04,175 --> 00:38:05,675
<font color="yellow">We are fine.</font>

582
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:09,145
<font color="yellow">We agreed to focus on work and not to pressure each other.</font>

583
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:12,815
<font color="yellow">That's what you should have done.</font>

584
00:38:13,645 --> 00:38:15,375
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

585
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:19,175
<font color="yellow">Okay. I won't worry about it.</font>

586
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:34,515
<font color="yellow">I'm so disappointed.</font>

587
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:39,815
<font color="yellow">I can't live because of Ae Ri and Jeong Eun.</font>

588
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,345
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, Ae Ri comes and bothers me.</font>

589
00:38:43,345 --> 00:38:46,075
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, Jeong Eun comes and bother me.</font>

590
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,985
<font color="yellow">Now they have an argument and come to me.</font>

591
00:38:49,015 --> 00:38:52,315
<font color="yellow">They start crying in front of me. That really bothers me.</font>

592
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:53,515
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

593
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:57,575
<font color="yellow">There are worse things than that.</font>

594
00:38:57,575 --> 00:38:59,315
<font color="yellow">What do you mean there are worse things?</font>

595
00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:02,215
<font color="yellow">Children are so bothersome.</font>

596
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:05,485
<font color="yellow">You should never live so close to your kids.</font>

597
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,945
<font color="yellow">No matter how angry I am at them, I can't help crying when they cry.</font>

598
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:16,245
<font color="yellow">I feel sadder when they are sad.</font>

599
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,845
<font color="yellow">For me, my daughter is...</font>

600
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:21,515
<font color="yellow">much more important than Jeong Eun.</font>

601
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:24,875
<font color="yellow">She knows how her mother suffered after she was born.</font>

602
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:27,945
<font color="yellow">I won't let it slide this time.</font>

603
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:31,715
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

604
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:34,345
<font color="yellow">Just leave her the way she is.</font>

605
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:37,145
<font color="yellow">Your children have grown up so well.</font>

606
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:39,675
<font color="yellow">You should appreciate it.</font>

607
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,275
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep talking things unrealistic...</font>

608
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:44,715
<font color="yellow">like a saint?</font>

609
00:39:44,945 --> 00:39:49,445
<font color="yellow">You may not know, but there are...</font>

610
00:39:49,445 --> 00:39:52,345
<font color="yellow">much more terrible things happening in the world.</font>

611
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:53,815
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

612
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:58,515
<font color="yellow">Things we have never imagined are taking place these days.</font>

613
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:00,745
<font color="yellow">Children...</font>

614
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:04,515
<font color="yellow">threaten and drive their parents out.</font>

615
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,715
<font color="yellow">They even neglect and abandon their parents easily.</font>

616
00:40:07,715 --> 00:40:10,485
<font color="yellow">That's what's happening these days.</font>

617
00:40:16,045 --> 00:40:17,175
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

618
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,175
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

619
00:40:19,175 --> 00:40:21,145
<font color="yellow">Director Han's cell phone is off.</font>

620
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:23,775
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

621

<font color="yellow">but I couldn't meet him today.</font>

623
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:31,045
<font color="yellow">Can you put him on for me?</font>

624
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:32,745
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

632
00:41:15,615 --> 00:41:18,775
<font color="yellow">Please don't turn your phone off, Director Han.</font>

633
00:41:19,015 --> 00:41:21,615
<font color="yellow">Officials like us are destined to keep working...</font>

634
00:41:21,775 --> 00:41:23,745
<font color="yellow">even after we get home.</font>

<font color="yellow">Ms. Bang, have a good evening.</font>

641
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:47,515
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Dong Hui.</font>

642
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:49,375

<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

644
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:53,445
<font color="yellow">By the way, did something happen to you?</font>

645
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,645
<font color="yellow">What makes you think so?</font>

646
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,945
<font color="yellow">You didn't look happy at the office all day.</font>

647
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:00,815
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

648
00:42:01,315 --> 00:42:02,375
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

649

<font color="yellow">How is "Romance Learned through Books" going?</font>

650
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:07,845
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you're working on the 5th and 6th episode?</font>

651
00:42:08,145 --> 00:42:11,875
<font color="yellow">- It's almost done. - Then, you should let me read.</font>

<font color="yellow">It's such a nice office.</font>

701
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:50,775
<font color="yellow">Have a seat, please.</font>

702

<font color="yellow">so please help us out.</font>

779
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,775
<font color="yellow">Look, that's not...</font>

780
00:50:50,115 --> 00:50:53,175
<font color="yellow">Don't forget to take the vitamins I sent you.</font>

781
00:50:53,575 --> 00:50:57,515
<font color="yellow">We should stay healthy to send our kids to good schools.</font>

782
00:50:58,575 --> 00:51:01,115
<font color="yellow">- I will see you later, then. - Hello?</font>

783
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:05,415
<font color="yellow">Are you there? Hello?</font>

784
00:51:07,645 --> 00:51:08,645
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

785
00:51:11,145 --> 00:51:12,475
<font color="yellow">What should I do now?</font>

786
00:51:24,845 --> 00:51:27,175
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - What is it?</font>

787
00:51:27,575 --> 00:51:29,875
<font color="yellow">What are those things on the dining table?</font>

788
00:51:32,175 --> 00:51:34,775
<font color="yellow">- It's your dinner. - What?</font>

789
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:39,945
<font color="yellow">I couldn't go to get groceries, so I ordered them.</font>

790
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:43,545
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't I try to lose weight?</font>

791
00:51:44,845 --> 00:51:46,575
<font color="yellow">Forget about it.</font>

792
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,145
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

793
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:57,175
<font color="yellow">Let's stop making our lives so hard.</font>

794
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,375
<font color="yellow">I'm going to the supermarket.</font>

795
00:52:21,445 --> 00:52:23,875
<font color="yellow">I should buy groceries for tomorrow's breakfast.</font>

796
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,775
<font color="yellow">Just eat those. Okay?</font>

797
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:29,815
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

798
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:04,275
<font color="yellow">Why did you come out? I told you to eat.</font>

799
00:53:04,675 --> 00:53:06,415
<font color="yellow">I ordered your favorite food.</font>

800
00:53:06,675 --> 00:53:09,375
<font color="yellow">You're not feeling well. I didn't want you to carry heavy things.</font>

801
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:11,775
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

802
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:14,945
<font color="yellow">Give them to me.</font>

803
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,845
<font color="yellow">I know you're upset because of me.</font>

804
00:53:25,875 --> 00:53:27,545
<font color="yellow">It's not like this is the first time.</font>

805
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:31,715
<font color="yellow">I know I embarrass you.</font>

806
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:36,945
<font color="yellow">I didn't say you embarrass me.</font>

807
00:53:38,145 --> 00:53:39,775
<font color="yellow">You don't say it, but I know you do.</font>

808
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:45,545
<font color="yellow">I thought about what I should do...</font>

809
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:48,745
<font color="yellow">to make you and Dad proud of me in the past few days.</font>

810
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:51,115
<font color="yellow">And?</font>

811
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:53,875
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can get good grades...</font>

812
00:53:54,575 --> 00:53:56,015
<font color="yellow">just like Dad said.</font>

813
00:53:56,815 --> 00:53:57,915
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

814
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:00,175
<font color="yellow">Should I become a Korean wrestler?</font>

815
00:54:01,245 --> 00:54:03,015
<font color="yellow">- What? - I'm big.</font>

816
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:04,745
<font color="yellow">Maybe I'll be a good Korean wrestler.</font>

817
00:54:04,745 --> 00:54:05,745
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

818
00:54:07,775 --> 00:54:11,075
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this. Do you think it's easy?</font>

819
00:54:11,145 --> 00:54:15,245
<font color="yellow">Do you know how hard wrestlers train and exercise?</font>

820
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:17,775
<font color="yellow">If you think you can be a wrestler just because you're big,</font>

821
00:54:17,975 --> 00:54:21,245
<font color="yellow">it'd be an insult to the wrestlers. Do you hear me?</font>

822
00:54:22,545 --> 00:54:23,575
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

823
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,515
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

824
00:54:28,615 --> 00:54:30,915
<font color="yellow">wanted to make you feel better.</font>

825
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:56,415
<font color="yellow">This is fine silk. Gosh.</font>

826
00:55:06,645 --> 00:55:07,675
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

827
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:12,415
<font color="yellow">Oh, goodness.</font>

828
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,375
<font color="yellow">You look gorgeous, Hye Joo.</font>

829
00:55:20,875 --> 00:55:23,645
<font color="yellow">I guess I didn't look good because...</font>

830
00:55:23,645 --> 00:55:26,675
<font color="yellow">I didn't own a classy scarf like this.</font>

831
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:31,145
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it looks great.</font>

832
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:50,575
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this feels nice.</font>

833
00:55:51,545 --> 00:55:54,875
<font color="yellow">I can already feel my body getting healthier.</font>

834
00:55:58,715 --> 00:56:01,275
<font color="yellow">Mom. What are you doing?</font>

835
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:07,075
<font color="yellow">Hi, Ji Hoon.</font>

836
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:10,945
<font color="yellow">Why are you wearing that on your head?</font>

837
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:14,715
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes. It's nothing.</font>

838
00:56:15,315 --> 00:56:16,975
<font color="yellow">I was just cold.</font>

839
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:19,415
<font color="yellow">Since this is a basement,</font>

840
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:21,875
<font color="yellow">the cold wind gets through.</font>

841
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:24,515
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

842
00:56:25,245 --> 00:56:27,245
<font color="yellow">I have something I want to tell you.</font>

843
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:29,345
<font color="yellow">Sure. Go ahead.</font>

844
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:34,015
<font color="yellow">You know, school starts tomorrow.</font>

845
00:56:34,175 --> 00:56:37,045
<font color="yellow">That's right. It starts tomorrow. Hey.</font>

846
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:40,015
<font color="yellow">Since you brought it up, let me ask you.</font>

847
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:44,645
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can top the class this year, too?</font>

848
00:56:45,245 --> 00:56:46,245
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

849
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:49,975
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

850
00:56:50,915 --> 00:56:53,775
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking.</font>

851
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,845
<font color="yellow">You're now in your third grade.</font>

852
00:56:56,645 --> 00:57:00,415
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't it be nice to keep up the good grades?</font>

853
00:57:01,175 --> 00:57:04,345
<font color="yellow">You said I could just stay in the top 10 students.</font>

854
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:06,145
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you brat.</font>

855
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:09,945
<font color="yellow">You're a guy. Don't just settle for being in the top 10.</font>

856
00:57:09,945 --> 00:57:12,215
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do it, be the top student...</font>

857
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:15,945
<font color="yellow">as you always have been. You can play in your spare time.</font>

858
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:20,545
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to do that.</font>

859
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:22,875
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

860
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:24,915
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to a specialized high school.</font>

861
00:57:26,315 --> 00:57:27,745
<font color="yellow">Which school do you want to go?</font>

862
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:32,075
<font color="yellow">I want to go to a regular high school.</font>

863
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:35,675
<font color="yellow">Also, I'm going to...</font>

864
00:57:36,345 --> 00:57:38,815
<font color="yellow">- become a magician. - What?</font>

865
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:41,745
<font color="yellow">A magician?</font>

866
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:43,515
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

867
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:51,115
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I'm not going to care anymore.</font>

868
00:57:52,675 --> 00:57:53,675
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

869
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:58,945
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I can achieve my dream thanks to you.</font>

870
00:57:59,415 --> 00:58:01,245
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - You don't have to know.</font>

871
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:05,415
<font color="yellow">I will repay you for this whenever I can. Okay?</font>

872
00:58:10,075 --> 00:58:12,975
<font color="yellow">Here is the fatty, you're a fatso</font>

873
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:16,115
<font color="yellow">- You got your mom switched, right? - Do you want me to punch you?</font>

874
00:58:16,215 --> 00:58:17,615
<font color="yellow">- You punk. - Chang Soo!</font>

875
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:21,445
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo. See me in the music room.</font>

876
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:28,545
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Ji Hoon and Ah In?</font>

877
00:58:28,545 --> 00:58:31,075
<font color="yellow">I brought you some fried chicken.</font>

878
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:36,475
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

879
00:58:37,875 --> 00:58:40,115
<font color="yellow">Please look at this. Watch.</font>

880
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:43,145
<font color="yellow">In 1, 2, 3.</font>

881
00:58:45,345 --> 00:58:47,175
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's snowing!</font>

882
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:50,175
<font color="yellow">It's like flowers are falling! Yes!</font>

883
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:55,345
<font color="yellow">- Sure. - What's going on?</font>

884
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:57,975
<font color="yellow">What happened to our house? I can't believe this.</font>

885
00:58:58,115 --> 00:58:59,415
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

886
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:01,015
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

887
00:59:02,845 --> 00:59:05,015
<font color="yellow">This is so cool, Ji Hoon.</font>

888
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,515
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

889
00:59:07,545 --> 00:59:08,615
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

890
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:11,175
<font color="yellow">My school resumed today.</font>

891
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:14,545
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

892
00:59:15,615 --> 00:59:19,545
<font color="yellow">My teacher wants to see you.</font>

893
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:21,515
<font color="yellow">Then I guess I should go.</font>

894
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:28,075
<font color="yellow">I'm sure your teacher wants to see me...</font>

895
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:31,045
<font color="yellow">to talk about your bad grades.</font>

896
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:33,275
<font color="yellow">It's not my homeroom teacher.</font>

897
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,745
<font color="yellow">The music teacher wants to see you.</font>

898
00:59:38,515 --> 00:59:39,575
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

899
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:42,845
<font color="yellow">Did you... By a chance...</font>

900
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,815
<font color="yellow">Did you break the piano in the music room?</font>

901
00:59:49,515 --> 00:59:52,175
<font color="yellow">How do you do this, Ji Hoon?</font>

902
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:54,845
<font color="yellow">You can create a special device for it.</font>

903
00:59:55,615 --> 00:59:56,615
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

904
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,815
<font color="yellow">When will it stop?</font>

905
01:00:01,215 --> 01:00:03,015
<font color="yellow">We have a little more.</font>

906
01:00:03,575 --> 01:00:04,875
<font color="yellow">- I see. - Yes.</font>

907
01:00:08,815 --> 01:00:09,875
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

908
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:12,475
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon wants to become...</font>

909
01:00:13,015 --> 01:00:16,115
<font color="yellow">a magician instead of going to specialized high school.</font>

910
01:00:16,515 --> 01:00:18,945
<font color="yellow">What? Magician?</font>

911
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:25,015
<font color="yellow">He saw this...</font>

912
01:00:25,475 --> 01:00:28,345
<font color="yellow">on the video, "Secret of Magic".</font>

913
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:33,045
<font color="yellow">We have Harry Potter in our family.</font>

914
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:45,715
<font color="yellow">Mom, sprinkles keep falling from the sky.</font>

915
01:00:45,915 --> 01:00:47,015
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

916
01:00:49,745 --> 01:00:51,345
<font color="yellow">It keeps falling, doesn't it?</font>

917
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,315
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

918
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:01,315
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

919
01:01:02,945 --> 01:01:05,315
<font color="yellow">Are you going to get enormously drunk again...</font>

920
01:01:06,115 --> 01:01:08,315
<font color="yellow">when you come down from the mountain?</font>

921
01:01:09,475 --> 01:01:11,115
<font color="yellow">I'm not.</font>

922
01:01:11,715 --> 01:01:13,845
<font color="yellow">When did I drink that much?</font>

923
01:01:13,915 --> 01:01:15,615
<font color="yellow">What's going on with you these days?</font>

924
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:20,445
<font color="yellow">Was I so wrong for saying that about Seong Joon's marriage?</font>

925
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:22,245
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

926
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:25,045
<font color="yellow">I just wanted him...</font>

927
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:28,375
<font color="yellow">to marry a better woman than his brothers.</font>

928
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,045
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean anything else.</font>

929
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:32,745
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

930
01:01:33,745 --> 01:01:37,415
<font color="yellow">But still, you came home drunk because I said that in the morning.</font>

931
01:01:37,475 --> 01:01:39,445
<font color="yellow">You made me take care of you.</font>

932
01:01:39,615 --> 01:01:41,015
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

933
01:01:42,815 --> 01:01:45,545
<font color="yellow">No matter what you say,</font>

934
01:01:45,575 --> 01:01:47,275
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry Seong Joon off well.</font>

935
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:50,945
<font color="yellow">That way he doesn't have to struggle like his brothers.</font>

936
01:01:51,315 --> 01:01:54,375
<font color="yellow">I'm going to marry him off to a family that would...</font>

937
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,175
<font color="yellow">believe in him and support him.</font>

938
01:01:57,275 --> 01:01:59,275
<font color="yellow">You may point fingers at me for being a materialistic person,</font>

939
01:01:59,275 --> 01:02:01,245
<font color="yellow">but I can't help it.</font>

940
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:05,475
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I told you it's not about that.</font>

941
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,575
<font color="yellow">If you come home drunk again,</font>

942
01:02:08,575 --> 01:02:11,215
<font color="yellow">and I'm going to change the gate lock password.</font>

943
01:02:17,675 --> 01:02:18,845
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

944
01:02:19,445 --> 01:02:20,475
<font color="yellow">What did you...</font>

945
01:02:21,315 --> 01:02:22,615
<font color="yellow">just say?</font>

946
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:23,845
<font color="yellow">Why don't you...</font>

947
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,845
<font color="yellow">get Chang Soo a vocal lesson?</font>

948
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:30,445
<font color="yellow">- A vocal lesson? - Yes.</font>

949
01:02:32,775 --> 01:02:33,975
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

950
01:02:34,345 --> 01:02:36,075
<font color="yellow">I appreciate your suggestion,</font>

951
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:40,415
<font color="yellow">but doesn't he need to be born with a gift for that?</font>

952
01:02:41,045 --> 01:02:44,315
<font color="yellow">You can't pursue music,</font>

953
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:47,075
<font color="yellow">especially classical music,</font>

954
01:02:47,175 --> 01:02:51,375
<font color="yellow">unless you have an unbelievable talent.</font>

955
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:54,145
<font color="yellow">Ma'am,</font>

956
01:02:54,745 --> 01:02:57,075
<font color="yellow">Chang So has an unbelievable talent.</font>

957
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:00,275
<font color="yellow">- What? - He's got the qualities of...</font>

958
01:03:00,415 --> 01:03:03,575
<font color="yellow">top 0.001 percent as an opera singer.</font>

959
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:05,075
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

960
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,375
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

961
01:03:08,145 --> 01:03:09,145
<font color="yellow">Did you say...</font>

962
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:12,945
<font color="yellow">top 0.001 percent?</font>

963
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:51,015
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

964
01:03:52,615 --> 01:03:56,145
<font color="yellow">I brought the man who found Sang Woo that night.</font>

965
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,815
<font color="yellow">What's up, Sun Hwa?</font>

966
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,375
<font color="yellow">What time is it in New York?</font>

967
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:14,675
<font color="yellow">What? You're getting married!</font>

968
01:04:15,675 --> 01:04:17,245
<font color="yellow">Congratulations!</font>

969
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:20,575
<font color="yellow">You kicked me out every night to be with him...</font>

970
01:04:20,575 --> 01:04:22,445
<font color="yellow">and made me get a job.</font>

971
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:24,315
<font color="yellow">You're marrying him, aren't you?</font>

972
01:04:26,175 --> 01:04:27,175
<font color="yellow">How am I?</font>

973
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:32,845
<font color="yellow">I don't know if I have a boyfriend or not.</font>

974
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:37,045
<font color="yellow">I'm depressed because my boyfriend is giving me a hard time these days.</font>

975
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:39,315
<font color="yellow">My boyfriend?</font>

976
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,515
<font color="yellow">You will be shocked when you hear the name.</font>

977
01:04:44,115 --> 01:04:46,945
<font color="yellow">Remember the company Golden Street?</font>

978
01:04:47,015 --> 01:04:48,645
<font color="yellow">It was in front of your sandwich shop.</font>

979
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:50,545
<font color="yellow">That night,</font>

980
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:55,175
<font color="yellow">I went to Han River to do some night fishing.</font>

981
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:59,515
<font color="yellow">I wasn't catching any fish, and it kept getting cold.</font>

982
01:05:00,175 --> 01:05:02,245
<font color="yellow">So I wrapped up early and headed home.</font>

983
01:05:03,415 --> 01:05:05,745
<font color="yellow">And I saw one boy...</font>

984
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,515
<font color="yellow">who was crying loudly.</font>

985
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:10,615
<font color="yellow">I looked around, but there was no adult.</font>

986
01:05:10,845 --> 01:05:13,045
<font color="yellow">It was very late, too.</font>

987
01:05:13,615 --> 01:05:15,415
<font color="yellow">He was wearing only a thin coat.</font>

988
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:18,675
<font color="yellow">He was wearing sneakers, but he wasn't wearing any socks.</font>

989
01:05:19,945 --> 01:05:22,215
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange, and I asked him.</font>

990
01:05:24,615 --> 01:05:26,075
<font color="yellow">I asked him why he was crying.</font>

991
01:05:26,745 --> 01:05:28,275
<font color="yellow">I asked him if he had lost his mother.</font>

992
01:05:28,915 --> 01:05:32,145
<font color="yellow">Then he suddenly cried,</font>

993
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:35,115
<font color="yellow">"Brother! Brother!"</font>

994
01:05:35,815 --> 01:05:37,675
<font color="yellow">"Brother! Brother!"</font>

995
01:05:39,315 --> 01:05:43,275
<font color="yellow">He was calling his brother so sadly.</font>

996
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,715
<font color="yellow">What? Did you say Gold Street is still in business?</font>

997
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,145
<font color="yellow">That's not possible.</font>

998
01:05:56,245 --> 01:05:58,875
<font color="yellow">He lost everything.</font>

999
01:06:55,075 --> 01:06:57,215
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1000
01:06:57,345 --> 01:07:00,245
<font color="yellow">I doubt a person like him would have raised my brother.</font>

1001
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,575
<font color="yellow">Was it that happy?</font>

1002
01:07:02,175 --> 01:07:04,575
<font color="yellow">If you get blinded by money,</font>

1003
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:07,715
<font color="yellow">power, and honor, you might get into a big trouble.</font>

1004
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:10,375
<font color="yellow">Until when do we have to wait?</font>

1005
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:11,515
<font color="yellow">Do you think she's even alive?</font>

1006
01:07:11,515 --> 01:07:13,815
<font color="yellow">You didn't forget your proposal to me, right?</font>

1007
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:17,145
<font color="yellow">- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.</font>

1008
01:07:17,275 --> 01:07:19,215
<font color="yellow">They look like a newly married couple.</font>
