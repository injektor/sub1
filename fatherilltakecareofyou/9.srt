00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,250

<font color="yellow">Aren't you cold?</font>

43
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,850
<font color="yellow">I left my jacket and bag in the computer room.</font>

44
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,680
<font color="yellow">Do you want to put this on?</font>

45
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,650
<font color="yellow">No, I'll just bear it. I'm too embarrassed.</font>

<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

50
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,850
<font color="yellow">- did you come here to write? - Yes.</font>

51
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,880
<font color="yellow">Did you read it by any chance?</font>

52
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,580
<font color="yellow">- I did. - What?</font>

53
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,280
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep looking at my work?</font>

54
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,320
<font color="yellow">This is why you wanted to work at our company.</font>

55
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

56
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,720
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

57
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480
<font color="yellow">there are a lot of people...</font>

58
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,220
<font color="yellow">who wants to work at your company...</font>

59
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,150
<font color="yellow">as an assistant writer.</font>

60
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,050
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

61
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,920
<font color="yellow">Is that why you signed that unfair contract?</font>

62
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,480
<font color="yellow">The contract that ties you for 16 years and 8 months.</font>

63
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,980
<font color="yellow">Actually, I can pay back before the contract gets over.</font>

64
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,050
<font color="yellow">If I win the TV drama script contest,</font>

65
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,720
<font color="yellow">I will get a cash prize of 10,000 dollars.</font>

66
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,680
<font color="yellow">- If I get that... - I don't think you'll get it.</font>

67
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,950
<font color="yellow">When did I say I'll get it? I said there's a chance.</font>

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,050
<font color="yellow">And what's wrong with having a dream and hope?</font>

69
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,150
<font color="yellow">How can you ruin my dream like this?</font>

70
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,250
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me disheartened? Is that your hobby?</font>

71
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

72
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,550
<font color="yellow">I know it well, too.</font>

73
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,150
<font color="yellow">Do you learn writing from anyone?</font>

74
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,980
<font color="yellow">No. Who would teach me?</font>

75
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,420
<font color="yellow">I want to take some writing class,</font>

76
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,350
<font color="yellow">but I have to make a living first. So I can't attend any class.</font>

77
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,780
<font color="yellow">- So do you write yourself? - Yes.</font>

78
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,120
<font color="yellow">- With the library's computer? - Yes.</font>

79
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,850
<font color="yellow">My brother took the laptop I got from Hye Joo as a gift.</font>

80
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,120
<font color="yellow">Actually, I went to Taiwan to get my laptop.</font>

81
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,350
<font color="yellow">Your brother is truly unbelievable.</font>

82
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,620
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

83
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,850
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

84
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,550
<font color="yellow">What's up? Did you forget that there are gangsters out there?</font>

85
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,450
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

86
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,480
<font color="yellow">in dramas,</font>

87
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,580
<font color="yellow">a man always kisses a woman in a scene like this.</font>

88
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,580
<font color="yellow">I just remembered that.</font>

89
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,680
<font color="yellow">Why...</font>

90
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,520
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

91
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,650
<font color="yellow">I'm... I'm so sorry.</font>

92
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,420
<font color="yellow">I must be mad. I'm mad.</font>

93
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,620
<font color="yellow">I didn't have any other intention.</font>

94
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,150
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,950
<font color="yellow">Wait. Please hold on.</font>

96
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,080
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
<font color="yellow">Yes, Grandma.</font>

98
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,950
<font color="yellow">Do you know what time it is? Why aren't you still home?</font>

99
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,520
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

100
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,680
<font color="yellow">I have to work all night. I don't think I can go home.</font>

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,550
<font color="yellow">How can they ask you to work all night?</font>

102
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,980
<font color="yellow">You just joined.</font>

103
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,880
<font color="yellow">There's nothing I can do about it.</font>

104
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,220
<font color="yellow">I will try to finish work as soon as possible and go home.</font>

105
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,950
<font color="yellow">What are they doing to a young lady?</font>

106
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,250
<font color="yellow">If they keep doing that, just quit.</font>

107
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,020
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Grandma. I'll rush home as soon as possible.</font>

108
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,790
<font color="yellow">- Is it your grandmother? - Yes.</font>

109
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
<font color="yellow">She wants me to quit work.</font>

110
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,980
<font color="yellow">You should quit.</font>

111
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
<font color="yellow">Maybe I should.</font>

112
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,080
<font color="yellow">I think I won. My goodness.</font>

113
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,290
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't.</font>

114
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,520
<font color="yellow">Let me see.</font>

115
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,950
<font color="yellow">You need five more cards to win.</font>

116
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,950
<font color="yellow">You're impatient.</font>

117
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,220
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

118
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,850
<font color="yellow">Then what about all the other cards I got?</font>

119
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,050
<font color="yellow">You need to get the cards from the same group.</font>

120
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,790
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, they're pointless.</font>

121
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,790
<font color="yellow">I thought more cards meant winning.</font>

122
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,820
<font color="yellow">How can you ask me to play cards at 2am when you're so bad like that?</font>

123
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,180
<font color="yellow">I just remembered that I didn't give you soft persimmons.</font>

124
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,980
<font color="yellow">You don't have to lie.</font>

125
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,020
<font color="yellow">I couldn't sleep, too.</font>

126
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,080
<font color="yellow">I wonder why old people can't fall asleep easily.</font>

127
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,320
<font color="yellow">Because our lives are reaching an end.</font>

128
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,520
<font color="yellow">We can do whatever we didn't get to do before.</font>

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,480
<font color="yellow">How can your granddaughter spend the night at work?</font>

130
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,320
<font color="yellow">Are you sure she's not with a man?</font>

131
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,020
<font color="yellow">She's not that kind of a girl.</font>

132
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,780
<font color="yellow">You never know.</font>

133
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,180
<font color="yellow">You know nothing about young adults these days.</font>

134
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,880
<font color="yellow">No one can predict the relationship between a man and a woman.</font>

135
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,780
<font color="yellow">I just meant that she should get married soon.</font>

136
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,850
<font color="yellow">She has a goal.</font>

137
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,680
<font color="yellow">A goal? What is her goal?</font>

138
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,880
<font color="yellow">You don't have to know.</font>

139
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,050
<font color="yellow">Women shouldn't have goals. They should just get married well.</font>

140
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,520
<font color="yellow">- I won. - What?</font>

141
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
<font color="yellow">I won the game.</font>

142
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,850
<font color="yellow">When did that happen?</font>

143
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,080
<font color="yellow">It just did.</font>

144
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,680
<font color="yellow">- Give me the money. - Goodness.</font>

145
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,850
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Come on.</font>

146
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,880
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

147
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,080
<font color="yellow">It's all good.</font>

148
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,980
<font color="yellow">I dreamed of sleeping in a pile of books.</font>

149
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,850
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to be a writer?</font>

150
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,620
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

151
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,920
<font color="yellow">Is it because you want to be famous?</font>

152
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,220
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

153
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,780
<font color="yellow">And you want to make a lot of money, right?</font>

154
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,880
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

155
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,380
<font color="yellow">And you want to date a good-looking actor, too.</font>

156
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,350
<font color="yellow">Just like my grandma, you want to date...</font>

157
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,080
<font color="yellow">Park Bo Gum, Song Joong Ki, and Gong Yoo, right?</font>

158
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,280
<font color="yellow">It's a lifelong wish.</font>

159
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,150
<font color="yellow">I'm seeing new sides of you, today.</font>

160
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,880
<font color="yellow">("Anne of Green Gables")</font>

161
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,750
<font color="yellow">How disappointing. These are the reasons you want to become a writer.</font>

162
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,120
<font color="yellow">In fact, I have one more reason.</font>

163
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,820
<font color="yellow">It's because I don't have my parents.</font>

164
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,280
<font color="yellow">On TV, I see a lot of parents.</font>

165
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,480
<font color="yellow">I wondered why I didn't have mine and was living with my grandmother.</font>

166
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,350
<font color="yellow">My grandmother worked.</font>

167
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,220
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo and I had a big age gap,</font>

168
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,280
<font color="yellow">and Cheol Min always went out.</font>

169
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,080
<font color="yellow">So I spent most of my time alone.</font>

170
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,480
<font color="yellow">And I was poor extremely.</font>

171
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,080
<font color="yellow">That's why I used my imagination to make up the things I didn't have.</font>

172
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,480
<font color="yellow">Your parents weren't around?</font>

173
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,450
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

174
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,520
<font color="yellow">I have no memory of them.</font>

175
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,750
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

176
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,980
<font color="yellow">No, don't be. Why are you sorry?</font>

177
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,020
<font color="yellow">It means...</font>

178
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,680
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be a famous writer and make a lot of money.</font>

179
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,050
<font color="yellow">I'm going to pay you back the debt and quit my job, too.</font>

180
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,750
<font color="yellow">Watch me. I'm going to be...</font>

181
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,420
<font color="yellow">the most famous TV drama script writer in Korea.</font>

182
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,280
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you for today.</font>

183
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,750
<font color="yellow">Don't forget about me when you become a famous writer.</font>

184
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,150
<font color="yellow">Of course not.</font>

185
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,420
<font color="yellow">"She was a 11-year-old girl who was wearing a tight and short dress."</font>

186
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,120
<font color="yellow">"The dress had yellow stains with white..."</font>

187
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,080
<font color="yellow">"which made her look very unappealing."</font>

188
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,080
<font color="yellow">"She was wearing a faded straw hat."</font>

189
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,920
<font color="yellow">"Under the hat, her red hair was thick and..."</font>

190
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,350
<font color="yellow">"braided into two that was placed behind her back."</font>

191
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,120
<font color="yellow">- "Her face was small and..." - You read it wrong. It's slim.</font>

192
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,850
<font color="yellow">You pronounced it wrong. So it's my turn.</font>

193
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,180
<font color="yellow">"Her face was small and slim with a lot of freckles."</font>

194
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,220
<font color="yellow">"Her mouth and eyes were big."</font>

195
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,420
<font color="yellow">"Then color of her eyes became green or gray..."</font>

196
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,920
<font color="yellow">"depending on her mood and the sunlight."</font>

197
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,380
<font color="yellow">Don't fall asleep. You'll freeze to death.</font>

198
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,720
<font color="yellow">- "In short..." - It's wrong.</font>

199
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,480
<font color="yellow">"In short, any good observers could..."</font>

200
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,380
<font color="yellow">"think that this homeless girl..."</font>

201
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,850
<font color="yellow">"might have a rare spirit with her."</font>

202
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,780
<font color="yellow">Hey, I told you to throw out the trash.</font>

203
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,950
<font color="yellow">- Move it somewhere else. - Okay.</font>

204
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,120
<font color="yellow">Always be careful. Just like any other day.</font>

205
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,220
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Yes.</font>

206
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,680
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

207
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,550
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

208
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,580
<font color="yellow">I'm sure the floor manager will go over it,</font>

209
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,780
<font color="yellow">but let me tell you a bit about the job since it's your first time.</font>

210
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,820
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

211
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,780
<font color="yellow">Your job is to take care of the trash on the construction site.</font>

212
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,820
<font color="yellow">I see. I understand.</font>

213
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
<font color="yellow">- You're a fast learner. - Yes.</font>

214
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,050
<font color="yellow">I was a good student.</font>

215
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,120
<font color="yellow">You have to collect the trash from each floor and put them in a bag.</font>

216
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,490
<font color="yellow">After that, place it in a designated area on the first floor.</font>

217
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,350
<font color="yellow">It won't be hard although it might be physically tiring.</font>

218
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,280
<font color="yellow">That's no excuse.</font>

219
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,150
<font color="yellow">I need a job.</font>

220
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,990
<font color="yellow">Let me know if you need help.</font>

221
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,320
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

222
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,520
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

223
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,450
<font color="yellow">how much would...</font>

224
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,250
<font color="yellow">I get paid if I work here?</font>

225
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,220
<font color="yellow">We give 130 dollars per day.</font>

226
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,720
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

227
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,350
<font color="yellow">130 dollars per day...</font>

228
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,050
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you so much.</font>

229
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,850
<font color="yellow">I'll do my best.</font>

230
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,750
<font color="yellow">Are you talking about that side?</font>

231
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,680
<font color="yellow">Hey, you. Be careful.</font>

232
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you so careless?</font>

233
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,420
<font color="yellow">Concentrate on your work.</font>

234
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,120
<font color="yellow">You'll be seriously injured if you fall from there.</font>

235
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,380
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll be careful. I'm sorry.</font>

236
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,490
<font color="yellow">He is even younger than me.</font>

237
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,380
<font color="yellow">- I'll instruct them, then. - Okay.</font>

238
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,580
<font color="yellow">For this side, I think we can follow the blueprint.</font>

239
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,880
<font color="yellow">We can decide later after we see how it goes.</font>

240
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

241
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,990
<font color="yellow">Mother, if you have this,</font>

242
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,450
<font color="yellow">you can check the balance...</font>

243
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:54,850
<font color="yellow">in your account and transfer money, too.</font>

244
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,820
<font color="yellow">If you download this application, you'll get a text message...</font>

245
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,490
<font color="yellow">right after someone sends you money.</font>

246
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,680
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

247
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,520
<font color="yellow">You can check the rental fee I sent you yesterday, right?</font>

248
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,050
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I can check it.</font>

249
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,620
<font color="yellow">This is amazing.</font>

250
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,320
<font color="yellow">What a convenient world we live in.</font>

251
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,250
<font color="yellow">- Of course, it is. - The rent is really in my account.</font>

252
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,490
<font color="yellow">- You can check it, right? - Yes.</font>

253
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,250
<font color="yellow">I'm going to be late. I need to work outside this morning.</font>

254
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,580
<font color="yellow">I'll be in after lunch.</font>

255
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,520
<font color="yellow">Put every invoice file on my desk. Okay.</font>

256
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,020
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook is such a pest.</font>

257
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,280
<font color="yellow">I have a meeting with my clients.</font>

258
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,680
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do?</font>

259
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,420
<font color="yellow">She ruined my face.</font>

260
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
<font color="yellow">Who is texting me this early in the morning?</font>

261
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,120
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

262
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,990
<font color="yellow">What? Moon Jeong Ae? Who is Moon Jeong Ae?</font>

263
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,080
<font color="yellow">"Good morning."</font>

264
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,250
<font color="yellow">Who's sending me a text early in the morning?</font>

265
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,550
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

266
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,720
<font color="yellow">She's not answering.</font>

267
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,220
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

268
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,880
<font color="yellow">The number one is gone.</font>

269
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,080
<font color="yellow">What do you mean the number one is gone?</font>

270
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,420
<font color="yellow">Let me explain. If the person reads your message,</font>

271
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,050
<font color="yellow">- the number disappears. - That means...</font>

272
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,780
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo read my message, doesn't it?</font>

273
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,680
<font color="yellow">Oh, gosh.</font>

274
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,520
<font color="yellow">I guess Hye Joo read your message, but decided to ignore it.</font>

275
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,350
<font color="yellow">What? Ignore my message?</font>

276
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,150
<font color="yellow">A new message.</font>

277
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,990
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

278
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,250
<font color="yellow">Who is it this now? Let me do my makeup.</font>

279
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,920
<font color="yellow">Are you ignoring my message?</font>

280
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,180
<font color="yellow">(Are you ignoring my message?)</font>

281
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,720
<font color="yellow">Who is this woman?</font>

282
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,720
<font color="yellow">Why does she keep talking to me so rudely?</font>

283
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,680
<font color="yellow">Who are you? Why do you keep sending me messages?</font>

284
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,650
<font color="yellow">I can't do my makeup because of you.</font>

285
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,320
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a job?</font>

286
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,450
<font color="yellow">Look at how she speaks to me.</font>

287
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,020
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. She must have gone crazy. How could she talk to you like this?</font>

288
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,250
<font color="yellow">Hold on. I shall teach her a lesson.</font>

289
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,620
<font color="yellow">- Hold on. - Why aren't you answering me?</font>

290
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,120
<font color="yellow">If you're going to reply so slowly, don't send me messages.</font>

291
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,320
<font color="yellow">- You slow fool. - What?</font>

292
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,050
<font color="yellow">"If you're going to reply so slowly, don't send me messages?"</font>

293
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,950
<font color="yellow">Mother. Give me your phone. I'll write the messages for you.</font>

294
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,250
<font color="yellow">Go on, Mother.</font>

295
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,990
<font color="yellow">Don't you recognize your mother-in-law?</font>

296
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,990
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to me that way?</font>

297
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,750
<font color="yellow">"Don't you recognize your mother-in-law?"</font>

298
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,350
<font color="yellow">"How dare you talk to me that way?"</font>

299
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,380
<font color="yellow">I sent it, Mother. I'll add a few more words.</font>

300
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,150
<font color="yellow">"This is why I hate you so much."</font>

301
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,150
<font color="yellow">"You always do the things I hate."</font>

302
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,150
<font color="yellow">"How do you expect me to like you?"</font>

303
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,280
<font color="yellow">"Also, as the eldest daughter-in-law,"</font>

304
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,650
<font color="yellow">"you did nothing to help this family."</font>

305
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,750
<font color="yellow">"You say you have to work, and hardly stay home."</font>

306
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,450
<font color="yellow">"Isn't that why you look down on me?"</font>

<font color="yellow">I didn't know it was her.</font>

311
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear. This is crazy.</font>

312
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,780
<font color="yellow">I forgot that it was Mother. What should I do?</font>

313
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,750
<font color="yellow">Come upstairs at once!</font>

316
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,750
<font color="yellow">How could it be "Moon Jeong Ae"? Am I your friend?</font>

317
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,280
<font color="yellow">Well... It's not that, Mother.</font>

318
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,220
<font color="yellow">As I started working,</font>

319
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,380
<font color="yellow">I formed a habit of saving...</font>

320
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,620
<font color="yellow">people's numbers with their full name.</font>

321
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,420
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous. That's not an excuse.</font>

322

324
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,850
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother. Please wait.</font>

325
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,850
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,520
<font color="yellow">My dear Mother.</font>

327
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,520
<font color="yellow">Look at Hee Sook's phone.</font>

328
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,980
<font color="yellow">It says, "My dear Mother".</font>

329
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,980
<font color="yellow">Mother. You can change it within three seconds.</font>

330
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,920
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't believe that.</font>

331
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,780
<font color="yellow">She also may not mean it.</font>

332
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,580
<font color="yellow">Whether she meant it or not, I can see it right here.</font>

333
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,950
<font color="yellow">Do you think people always hide the things they really mean?</font>

334
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,920
<font color="yellow">Change my name right now.</font>

335
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,980
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'll change it. I'm sorry.</font>

336
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,120
<font color="yellow">How does "My respected Mom" sound?</font>

337
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,880
<font color="yellow">Don't call me Mom.</font>

338
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,950
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

339
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,450
<font color="yellow">"My respected Mother"?</font>

340
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,780
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too obvious that you don't mean that yourself?</font>

341
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,550
<font color="yellow">It's fine. Let her.</font>

342
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,750
<font color="yellow">She should respect me at least for the moment I call her.</font>

343
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,850
<font color="yellow">Or she will keep looking down on me. "Oh, my. Jeong Ae is calling me."</font>

344
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,480
<font color="yellow">"Why does Jeong Ae call me so often?"</font>

345
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,080
<font color="yellow">"Isn't Jeong Ae crazy?"</font>

346
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,420
<font color="yellow">Mother. Why are you doing this to me?</font>

347
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,120
<font color="yellow">Isn't that why you ignored my messages?</font>

348
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,420
<font color="yellow">Mother. This is so unfair to me.</font>

349
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,880
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and change it.</font>

350
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,780
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

351
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,280
<font color="yellow">I'm changing it. I'm sorry.</font>

355
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,580
<font color="yellow">Okay.I'll pay you today.</font>

356
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,120
<font color="yellow">What happened to your face?</font>

357
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,880
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook says she bumped her face when she was pushing Ji Hoon's desk.</font>

358
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,980
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

359
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,480
<font color="yellow">I was pushing Chang Soo's desk as well.</font>

360
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,920
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo doesn't have a desk. He doesn't study.</font>

361

<font color="yellow">Stop talking nonsense.</font>

362
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,750

364
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,220
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to keep doing this? - What do you mean?</font>

365
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,820
<font color="yellow">You're obviously trying to come between me and Mother.</font>

366
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,520
<font color="yellow">So be a better daughter-in-law to Mother.</font>

367
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

368
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,780
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

369
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,350
<font color="yellow">- No. - Come here.</font>

370
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,820
<font color="yellow">Use your energy on something else.</font>

371
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,880
<font color="yellow">If I catch you, I'm going to kill you.</font>

372
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,880
<font color="yellow">Catch me if you can.</font>

373
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,580
<font color="yellow">You're dead. Come here.</font>

374
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,320
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Don't you slam the doors.</font>

375
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,020
<font color="yellow">Are you grumbling because I scolded you?</font>

376
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,520
<font color="yellow">It wasn't me, Mother.</font>

377
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,520
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate me so much?</font>

378
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,220
<font color="yellow">She's no match for me.</font>

379
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,620
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. It's the director of the boarding school.</font>

<font color="yellow">Hello, Director?</font>

381

<font color="yellow">Yes. I can go there right away.</font>

383
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,680

413
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,750
<font color="yellow">Why were you late?</font>

414
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,020
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind? Does your mind come and go?</font>

415
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,520
<font color="yellow">How long do I have to keep doing the things a rookie should be doing?</font>

<font color="yellow">He was a bit late today.</font>

438
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,120
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Hi.</font>

439
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,580
<font color="yellow">Why do you look so haggard?</font>

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,650
<font color="yellow">- Do I? - Yes.</font>

441
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,550
<font color="yellow">Did you stay up all night?</font>

442
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,780
<font color="yellow">You didn't shave, either.</font>

443
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,120
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

444
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,520
<font color="yellow">You look like a mischievous boy today.</font>

445
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,380
<font color="yellow">You didn't even change your clothes. I know you're a neat person.</font>

446
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:53,880
<font color="yellow">Did you drink last night?</font>

447
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,150
<font color="yellow">I didn't. Gosh.</font>

448
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,380
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

449
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,880
<font color="yellow">I've made a list of scriptwriters for the TV series next year.</font>

450
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,380
<font color="yellow">Really? What kind of writers did you pick?</font>

451
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,880
<font color="yellow">I just included budding writers.</font>

452
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,420
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable. Didn't you say you don't like budding writers?</font>

453
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,580
<font color="yellow">As you know, money matters the most.</font>

454
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,220
<font color="yellow">Full fledged writers require a great sum of money,</font>

455
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,380
<font color="yellow">and none of them are available now.</font>

456
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,320
<font color="yellow">So I selected new writers who has written...</font>

457
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,250
<font color="yellow">scripts for few short dramas.</font>

458
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,020
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her?</font>

459
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,350
<font color="yellow">Does she always work like that?</font>

460
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,280
<font color="yellow">She's already lost in dream from the morning.</font>

461
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,150
<font color="yellow">She's not.</font>

462
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:08,080
<font color="yellow">I'll go to the Planning Department.</font>

463
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,250
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you not to late.</font>

464
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,520
<font color="yellow">Don't ever be late.</font>

465
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,350
<font color="yellow">Or you'll become the first intern, assistant writer...</font>

466
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,120
<font color="yellow">and a dumb who's fired in the first week of working, okay?</font>

467
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,580
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

468
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,220
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Why are you making a grimace?</font>

469
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,320
<font color="yellow">Why are you sitting there with a sour face?</font>

470
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,820
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm okay.</font>

471
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,480
<font color="yellow">Don't even try to fool me. Your face tells me...</font>

472
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,880
<font color="yellow">that you're so depressed and has lost a will to live.</font>

473
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,880
<font color="yellow">Is it because of Jeong Eun?</font>

474
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,020
<font color="yellow">I understand. She's such a trouble maker.</font>

475
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,680
<font color="yellow">She made a fuss all day long even when she was little.</font>

476
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,680
<font color="yellow">I've never seen anyone so peculiar like her.</font>

477
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,920
<font color="yellow">I've heard about boys...</font>

478
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,650
<font color="yellow">who tease and make fun of girls,</font>

479
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,320
<font color="yellow">but she was the only one I know...</font>

480
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,520
<font color="yellow">who bullied other girls and even lifted their skirts.</font>

481
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,250
<font color="yellow">There's more. She won other boys' marbles and game cards.</font>

482
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,350
<font color="yellow">Then, she shouldn't have hit them at least.</font>

483
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,280
<font color="yellow">She hit the boys who acted up,</font>

484
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,980
<font color="yellow">and made us deal with the angry mothers of the boys...</font>

485
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,920
<font color="yellow">who lined up at our front door.</font>

486
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

487
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,550
<font color="yellow">What? Are you mad because I spoke ill of your daughter?</font>

488
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,650
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

489
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,950
<font color="yellow">Mom,</font>

490
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,080
<font color="yellow">you were embarrassed when I gave birth to Jeong Eun, right?</font>

491
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,520
<font color="yellow">Why do you bring that up out of the blue?</font>

492
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,550
<font color="yellow">Of course, I was embarrassed.</font>

493
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,180
<font color="yellow">It was long ago, about 30 years.</font>

494
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,950
<font color="yellow">The world is still harsh to unmarried mothers even now.</font>

495
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,450
<font color="yellow">And your father was a high-ranking official. Do you remember?</font>

496
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,950
<font color="yellow">I do.</font>

497
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,580
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying? Did something happen?</font>

498
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,620
<font color="yellow">Did you have a big fight with Jeong Eun?</font>

499
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,680
<font color="yellow">Wait, I must call Jeong Eun over and teach her a lesson.</font>

500
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,050
<font color="yellow">That's not necessary, Mom.</font>

501
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,420
<font color="yellow">It's not Jeong Eun's fault.</font>

502
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,950
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

503
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,420
<font color="yellow">kind of feel lonely...</font>

504
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,480
<font color="yellow">as the weather got cold these days.</font>

505
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,550
<font color="yellow">That's why I told you...</font>

506
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,980
<font color="yellow">that kids are useless when they grow up.</font>

507
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,850
<font color="yellow">I told you so many times to find someone...</font>

508
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,820
<font color="yellow">and start again.</font>

509
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,580
<font color="yellow">Hyung Seop and Hye Joo...</font>

510
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,020
<font color="yellow">willingly registered Jeong Eun as their child...</font>

511
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,880
<font color="yellow">so that you could live your life. It's you who rejected it.</font>

512
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,550
<font color="yellow">You didn't even bother to have an interest in any guys.</font>

513
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,220
<font color="yellow">Do you know how mean you were to the guys?</font>

514
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,750
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

515
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,620
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

516
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,890
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'll get going.</font>

517
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,650
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the tea.</font>

518
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,580
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri.</font>

519
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,850
<font color="yellow">What on earth happened to you?</font>

520
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,220
<font color="yellow">What's all this mess?</font>

521
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,750
<font color="yellow">How could she put her wet laundry on the piano?</font>

522
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,120
<font color="yellow">What a senseless wench.</font>

523
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,920
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

524
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,320
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun!</font>

525
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,320
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

526
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,950
<font color="yellow">- What is it this time? - What did you say?</font>

527
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,520
<font color="yellow">How can you mess the house like this?</font>

528
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,980
<font color="yellow">I told you to remove that tent.</font>

529
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,920
<font color="yellow">And the couch isn't something to hang your clothes on.</font>

530
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,350
<font color="yellow">Why do you put your clothes on it?</font>

531
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,980
<font color="yellow">I can't believe...</font>

532
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,980
<font color="yellow">that you placed your wet laundry on my piano.</font>

533
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,420
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how valuable the piano is to me?</font>

534
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,080
<font color="yellow">You said I can stay anywhere I want in this house.</font>

535
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,450
<font color="yellow">But I never said you can do whatever you want here!</font>

536
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,520
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll clean up later.</font>

537
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,180
<font color="yellow">- When? - I'll do it soon.</font>

538
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,420
<font color="yellow">So I'm asking when you will do it.</font>

539
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,050
<font color="yellow">I have had...</font>

540
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
<font color="yellow">the house keepr clean this big house only once a week,</font>

541
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,120
<font color="yellow">and that was just enough.</font>

542
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,550
<font color="yellow">How can you mess up the whole place right after you moved in?</font>

543
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,980
<font color="yellow">This isn't even your house.</font>

544
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,820
<font color="yellow">It's my house.</font>

545
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,050
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can live like this?</font>

546
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,720
<font color="yellow">How can you be so rude and conscienceless?</font>

547
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,150
<font color="yellow">This is why I shouldn't have moved in.</font>

548
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,120
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm supposed to say.</font>

549
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,390
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't have let you move in.</font>

550
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,350
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who had gone out of mind.</font>

551
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,950
<font color="yellow">We never suit each other well.</font>

552
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,280
<font color="yellow">I think the same, too.</font>

553
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,750
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll move out as soon as possible.</font>

554
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,320
<font color="yellow">How dare she...</font>

555
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,820
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

556
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,550
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun!</font>

557
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,050
<font color="yellow">When will you clean up?</font>

558
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,650
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun! Jeong Eun!</font>

559
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,180
<font color="yellow">I hate her when she nags me. I must move out.</font>

560
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,280
<font color="yellow">How should I make money anyway?</font>

561
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,820
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

562
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,950
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

563
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,020
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I forgot my bag.</font>

564
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,720
<font color="yellow">I do have my bag.</font>

565
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,350
<font color="yellow">I have my bag.</font>

566
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,780
<font color="yellow">Now, I shall begin the 420th briefing session...</font>

567
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,180
<font color="yellow">on opening a cafe.</font>

568
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,450
<font color="yellow">Let me explain the three factors you must check...</font>

569
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,580
<font color="yellow">before opening a cafe with an initial capital.</font>

570
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,320
<font color="yellow">You should check the location,</font>

571
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,650
<font color="yellow">how much capital you have,</font>

572
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,980
<font color="yellow">and how sustainable your business would be.</font>

573
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,890
<font color="yellow">How many menus do you have?</font>

574
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,750
<font color="yellow">Will I be able to make all of them?</font>

575
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,620
<font color="yellow">We have 12 different coffee drinks...</font>

576
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,650
<font color="yellow">and about 40 kinds of desserts.</font>

577
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,150
<font color="yellow">I think I'm not talented in this.</font>

578
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,150
<font color="yellow">How long will the training take?</font>

579
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
<font color="yellow">I finally found an amazing business.</font>

580
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,420
<font color="yellow">I saved enough money to secure the startup costs...</font>

581
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,980
<font color="yellow">thanks to my thrifty and frugal living.</font>

582
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,950
<font color="yellow">Where should I open it?</font>

583
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,080
<font color="yellow">The issue is rent.</font>

584
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,950
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me! - I'll call you later.</font>

585
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,780
<font color="yellow">- Please be careful. - I'm sorry.</font>

586
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:00,980
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

587
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,220
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll see you later.</font>

588
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,020
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, who is he? I haven't seen him before.</font>

589
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,250
<font color="yellow">Haven't you heard of him? He's the one who bought...</font>

590
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,920
<font color="yellow">all the properties in Bangbae-dong during the last three months.</font>

591
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,950
<font color="yellow">- He did? - Yes.</font>

592
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,320
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

593
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,450
<font color="yellow">You'd better be careful.</font>

594
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,550
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

595
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,890
<font color="yellow">- I said you need to be careful. - Gosh.</font>

596
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,320
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang is...</font>

597
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:52,580
<font color="yellow">pretty famous for that.</font>

598
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,350
<font color="yellow">Pardon? Ms. Jang Yoo Ra?</font>

599
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,750
<font color="yellow">What do you mean she's famous? She's famous for what?</font>

600
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,020
<font color="yellow">She takes advantage of men and dates no one.</font>

601
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,890
<font color="yellow">Even if you give her everything you have, it only lasts three months.</font>

602
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,720
<font color="yellow">Three months?</font>

603
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,150
<font color="yellow">That's too short.</font>

604
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,620
<font color="yellow">She doesn't care about martial status,</font>

605
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,120
<font color="yellow">but she cares about social status.</font>

606
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,480
<font color="yellow">Social status?</font>

607
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,350
<font color="yellow">You don't have a lot of money.</font>

608
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:23,120
<font color="yellow">Under diligent and kind parents,</font>

609
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,820
<font color="yellow">you studied hard and made it all the way here, right?</font>

610
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,520
<font color="yellow">Right. I did.</font>

611
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's true.</font>

612
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,020
<font color="yellow">Then she won't be interested in...</font>

613
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,550
<font color="yellow">people like you and me.</font>

614
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,890
<font color="yellow">- What? - Anyway.</font>

615
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,180
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

616
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,580
<font color="yellow">Three months?</font>

617
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,650
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

618
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,650
<font color="yellow">I can last more than three months.</font>

619
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,420
<font color="yellow">("Today's Current Event")</font>

620
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,450
<font color="yellow">Did you get home safely that night?</font>

621
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

622
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,780
<font color="yellow">The night when you had the reunion dinner.</font>

623
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,120
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

624
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:37,220
<font color="yellow">I got out as soon as I paid,</font>

625
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,050
<font color="yellow">but you were gone.</font>

626
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,220
<font color="yellow">I had other engagements.</font>

627
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,180
<font color="yellow">I see. That's why.</font>

628
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,520
<font color="yellow">You had other engagements.</font>

629
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,550
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that. I was disappointed.</font>

630
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,250
<font color="yellow">I wasn't too disappointed.</font>

631
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,450
<font color="yellow">I was disappointed just a little.</font>

632
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,550
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, it's hot. - It's hot.</font>

633
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,180
<font color="yellow">- This is so hot. - Are you okay?</font>

634
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,980
<font color="yellow">- It's really hot. - Gosh, look what happened.</font>

635
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,620
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

636
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,850
<font color="yellow">I'm just trying...</font>

637
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,020
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

638
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,650
<font color="yellow">I was just trying wipe it.</font>

639
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,050
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to clean it.</font>

640
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,980
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

641
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,050
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

642
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,920
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

643
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:42,950
<font color="yellow">Let's get ready and leave, everyone.</font>

644
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

645
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,550
<font color="yellow">- That was fast. - What?</font>

646
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,680
<font color="yellow">- You have a meeting today, right? - Yes.</font>

647
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,520
<font color="yellow">Let's go together. I'm heading that way.</font>

648
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,080
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to hit on you.</font>

649
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,890
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh. Aren't you going home?</font>

650
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,890
<font color="yellow">I need to finish what I started first.</font>

651
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,120
<font color="yellow">That's a great attitude.</font>

652
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,220
<font color="yellow">If you come late, then you should go home late.</font>

653
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
<font color="yellow">Okay.Goodbye.</font>

654
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,150
<font color="yellow">Director Kang will be at the vice president's birthday party.</font>

655
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,950
<font color="yellow">I think this is a great chance for you to meet him.</font>

656
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,580
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

657
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,220
<font color="yellow">We're late.</font>

658
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:09,450
<font color="yellow">(Go to college. You can go with your GED.)</font>

659
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,120
<font color="yellow">(Remember. To love is to share.)</font>

660
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,980
<font color="yellow">- Add this in, too. - Okay.</font>

661
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,650
<font color="yellow">It'll be 14 dollars all together.</font>

662
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,880
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

663
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:48,150
<font color="yellow">- Why is it so expensive? - You don't know?</font>

664
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,220
<font color="yellow">Snacks nowadays are...</font>

665
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,520
<font color="yellow">more expensive than food.</font>

666
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,280
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

667
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,120
<font color="yellow">Then, I won't take this.</font>

668
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,180
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

669
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,620
<font color="yellow">- It's 7 dollars and 50 cents. - Okay.</font>

670
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,150
<font color="yellow">What are you doing again?</font>

671
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,550
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

672
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

673
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,450
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

674
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,450
<font color="yellow">- Were you calling me? - Is there someone else here?</font>

675
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,820
<font color="yellow">Do you want this?</font>

676
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:51,680
<font color="yellow">Isn't this sushi?</font>

677
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,350
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

678
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,450
<font color="yellow">Don't thank me.</font>

679
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,720
<font color="yellow">It was buy 1 and get 1 for free when the store was closing.</font>

680
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,750
<font color="yellow">But still, thank you, Aunt.</font>

681
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,480
<font color="yellow">It's been so long that I had sushi.</font>

682
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:06,020
<font color="yellow">What hasn't been so long for you?</font>

683
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,520
<font color="yellow">But,</font>

684
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,820
<font color="yellow">this is for Ji Hoon. So don't touch this.</font>

685
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,580
<font color="yellow">He's going to eat it when he comes back from his academy.</font>

686
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,850
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is in his room.</font>

687
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:20,650
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

688
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,050
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

689
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,220
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Why are you home?</font>

690
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,480
<font color="yellow">Han Ji Hoon.</font>

691
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:42,150
<font color="yellow">- Because I don't feel well. - What's wrong with you?</font>

692
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,580
<font color="yellow">I just don't feel well.</font>

693
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,750
<font color="yellow">What are you mumbling about? Speak up.</font>

694
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,820
<font color="yellow">I just don't feel well.</font>

695
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,280
<font color="yellow">- Ah In, is it tasty? - Yes, it is.</font>

696
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,680
<font color="yellow">Since you can't eat raw fish,</font>

697
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,220
<font color="yellow">have fried tofu sushi.</font>

698
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,550
<font color="yellow">Isn't it good?</font>

699
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,680
<font color="yellow">This is your dinner.</font>

700
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,180
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, give me another one.</font>

701
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,020
<font color="yellow">Okay, here you go.</font>

702
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,020
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you don't feel well?</font>

703
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,950
<font color="yellow">You're sick because your mind is weak.</font>

704
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,680
<font color="yellow">I cook you a good meal. I drive you around so you don't catch a cold.</font>

705
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,920
<font color="yellow">I get you herbal tonics whenever I can.</font>

706
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,280
<font color="yellow">I even let you get IV fluids at your uncle's hospital.</font>

707
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,280
<font color="yellow">How can you feel sick?</font>

708
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:41,480
<font color="yellow">So it doesn't matter that your ranking went down, does it?</font>

709
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,820
<font color="yellow">This is all because you're not concentrating on your study.</font>

710
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,880
<font color="yellow">Good for you. I just went to look for a boarding academy.</font>

711
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,820
<font color="yellow">You'll go there this winter vacation.</font>

712
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:51,480
<font color="yellow">No, I won't.</font>

713
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,980
<font color="yellow">- What? - Why should I go there?</font>

714
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,420
<font color="yellow">Why? You'll go there to study, of course.</font>

715
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:00,380
<font color="yellow">- Why should I study, then? - To attend a prestigious college.</font>

716
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,350
<font color="yellow">We'll decide later if you'll major in law or medicine.</font>

717
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,780
<font color="yellow">If your grades are not good enough, you can be a professor, too.</font>

718
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,580
<font color="yellow">What will I do when I become a judge or prosecutor?</font>

719
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,050
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk like that?</font>

720
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,150
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, what's wrong?</font>

721
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,150
<font color="yellow">What kind of prosecutor will I be?</font>

722
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,050
<font color="yellow">The kind that collects bribes, chases after power,</font>

723
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,080
<font color="yellow">and puts innocent people behind bars?</font>

724
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,920
<font color="yellow">The kind of doctor that only does expensive surgeries to make money?</font>

725
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,720
<font color="yellow">The kind of professor that only takes care of wealthy students?</font>

726
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,050
<font color="yellow">Do I have to study day and night to be one of them?</font>

727
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,450
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

728
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,750
<font color="yellow">What an ungrateful child.</font>

729
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,950
<font color="yellow">How dare you to talk back to your mom like that?</font>

730
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,250
<font color="yellow">She didn't give birth to you after having you for 10 months...</font>

731
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,050
<font color="yellow">just to be treated like this.</font>

732
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,250
<font color="yellow">She's trying her best...</font>

733
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,550
<font color="yellow">to give you everything you need.</font>

734
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,150
<font color="yellow">Who gave birth to you? Did you come from the sky?</font>

735
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,480
<font color="yellow">I wish you have a son just like you.</font>

736
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,420
<font color="yellow">That line sounds very similar.</font>

737
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,950
<font color="yellow">Let's go now.</font>

738
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:22,550
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

739
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:29,250
<font color="yellow">I told you not to get involved with that family.</font>

740
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,220
<font color="yellow">Why would you come up here?</font>

741
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,780
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

742
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,780
<font color="yellow">- I didn't want to go up. - Then why did you?</font>

743
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,350
<font color="yellow">You didn't cook us dinner, but she gave us sushi.</font>

744
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,020
<font color="yellow">You don't even cook for your children.</font>

745
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,920
<font color="yellow">You always come home late.</font>

746
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,450
<font color="yellow">I went grocery shopping.</font>

747
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,920
<font color="yellow">So I can cook you dinner.</font>

748
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,220
<font color="yellow">I'm not just talking about today.</font>

749
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,650
<font color="yellow">The refrigerator is always empty. You don't give us breakfast.</font>

750
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,450
<font color="yellow">I have lunch at school...</font>

751
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:02,580
<font color="yellow">and eat ramyeon for dinner or goes to Grandpa's house.</font>

752
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,750
<font color="yellow">That's too much, Mom.</font>

753
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:07,550
<font color="yellow">I don't ask you for much like other kids.</font>

754
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,620
<font color="yellow">I only want daily meals. Is it too much to ask?</font>

755
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,450
<font color="yellow">You brat.</font>

756
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,080
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

757
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,550
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, Ah In.</font>

758
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,680
<font color="yellow">I should say the things I have to say.</font>

759
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,780
<font color="yellow">Go on, then.</font>

760
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,520
<font color="yellow">Get rid of the rice on your face.</font>

761
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,250
<font color="yellow">Aunt is a good homemaker. She makes a beautiful home,</font>

762
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:26,020
<font color="yellow">and she feeds her son well.</font>

763
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,050
<font color="yellow">What about you? What do you do for us?</font>

764
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,750
<font color="yellow">I'm a working mother.</font>

765
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,520
<font color="yellow">Still, Aunt gets up earlier than you.</font>

766
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,280
<font color="yellow">She also dresses up when she comes to our school.</font>

767
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,020
<font color="yellow">When you came to our school, I was so embarrassed.</font>

768
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,150
<font color="yellow">That's how...</font>

769
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,220
<font color="yellow">the mother with a son who gets such poor grades dresses.</font>

770
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,550
<font color="yellow">If I dress up when I go to your school,</font>

771
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,180
<font color="yellow">people will backbite me and say I only care about my looks, not you.</font>

772
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,480
<font color="yellow">- Do you understand? - It hurts.</font>

773
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:56,980
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

774
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,320
<font color="yellow">If you like your aunt that much, go and live with her.</font>

775
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,850
<font color="yellow">Call her Mom instead, you punk.</font>

776
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,350
<font color="yellow">I would like to if I could.</font>

777
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,350
<font color="yellow">I wish Aunt was my mom.</font>

778
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:08,920
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

779
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,780
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

780
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,250
<font color="yellow">Hong Gil Dong couldn't call his own mother "Mother".</font>

781
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,880
<font color="yellow">I understand how he must have felt.</font>

782
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,080
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

783
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,580
<font color="yellow">Live upstairs and never come back.</font>

784
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,520
<font color="yellow">My gosh. It'd be great if he lives upstairs.</font>

785
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,420
<font color="yellow">That's what I mean.</font>

786
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,150
<font color="yellow">Go easy.</font>

787
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,350
<font color="yellow">How did you hurt yourself again?</font>

788
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,120
<font color="yellow">- Do you work at construction sites? - Nonsense.</font>

789
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,080
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

790
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,450
<font color="yellow">Pay rent and use the rest as living expenses.</font>

791
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,180
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this money?</font>

792
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,420
<font color="yellow">That's not important as long as I didn't steal it.</font>

793
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,020
<font color="yellow">Put the pain relief patch.</font>

794
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,080
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I can't take this any more.</font>

795
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,480
<font color="yellow">My son and wife are driving me crazy.</font>

796
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,420
<font color="yellow">They always yell at each other, fight, and stop talking.</font>

797
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,280
<font color="yellow">This is why I don't want to come home.</font>

798
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,280
<font color="yellow">I can't rely on anyone here.</font>

799
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:40,050
<font color="yellow">Also, no matter how upset they may be,</font>

800
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,620
<font color="yellow">a son should greet his father when he comes home,</font>

801
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,680
<font color="yellow">and a wife should look at her husband when he comes home.</font>

802
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:48,550
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

803
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,450
<font color="yellow">Plus,</font>

804
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,480
<font color="yellow">she doesn't even do any of the household chores.</font>

805
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,650
<font color="yellow">She goes on a strike so often.</font>

806
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,920
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook. If I have an affair, you have only yourself to blame.</font>

807
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,020
<font color="yellow">Do you hear me?</font>

808
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,280
<font color="yellow">It's my underwear.</font>

809
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,920
<font color="yellow">I should buy a few more pairs.</font>

810
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:30,920
<font color="yellow">I'll be going, then. Keep up the good work.</font>

811
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,820
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, Sir. - See you tomorrow, Sir.</font>

00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,650
<font color="yellow">Yes. I have some errands to run.</font>

816
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,250
<font color="yellow">How is working here? Is it okay?</font>

817
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,220
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'm fine.</font>

818
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,820
<font color="yellow">Well.</font>

819
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,420
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for paying me in advance.</font>

820
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,850
<font color="yellow">I know it was too much to ask after working here for one day.</font>

821
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,050
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for readily granting my request.</font>

822
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,820
<font color="yellow">We're neighbors. It was no problem at all.</font>

823
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,620
<font color="yellow">Even if you run away without paying me back, you live across from me.</font>

824
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,120
<font color="yellow">I can go and catch you right away.</font>

825
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,320
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mr. Lee. I wouldn't run away without paying you.</font>

826
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,920
<font color="yellow">Please just do the jobs I assigned you.</font>

827
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:16,380
<font color="yellow">Of course. I will work harder.</font>

828
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:17,750
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be going now.</font>

829
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:22,880

833
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,680
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't they be?</font>

834
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,920

835
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,350
<font color="yellow">the annual sales made a surplus.</font>

<font color="yellow">We're now the third biggest newspaper agency.</font>

837
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,250

838
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,820
<font color="yellow">That's why you take over companies.</font>

<font color="yellow">That's right. There were people waiting to be placed in, right?</font>

<font color="yellow">Yes. Here are the documents.</font>

<font color="yellow">The company has recovered.</font>

846
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,480
<font color="yellow">Keep your promise and reinstate them.</font>

847
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,120

<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

851
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,380
<font color="yellow">I'll get going, then.</font>

852
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,320
<font color="yellow">Now that this company is making a profit,</font>

853
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,780

<font color="yellow">and my mom always nags me.</font>

860
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,720
<font color="yellow">Why are you here instead of being in your own house?</font>

861
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,520
<font color="yellow">My grandma is mean to me, too.</font>

862
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,920
<font color="yellow">Why don't I have a rich relative like that?</font>

863
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,880
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun. What are you doing?</font>

864
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,220
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

865
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,480
<font color="yellow">I'm cutting my hair here because I don't have money.</font>

866

<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

867
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,050
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

868
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:54,020
<font color="yellow">It's boiled napa cabbage. Please give this to Ms. Hwang.</font>

871
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,080
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

872
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,020
<font color="yellow">Don't you sleep out again.</font>

873
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,880
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

874
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,820
<font color="yellow">Don't smile.</font>

875
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,450
<font color="yellow">I'll be right back.</font>

876
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,950
<font color="yellow">Dad. Do you want to eat ramyeon?</font>

877
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:25,180
<font color="yellow">How can the used amount be 22?</font>

878
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,850
<font color="yellow">The water meter read 982 last month, and 1,004 this month.</font>

879
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,180
<font color="yellow">That means 7 of them only used 22.</font>

880
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,050
<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense.</font>

881
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,850
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't it make sense? They must have conserved water.</font>

882
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,280
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

883
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,280
<font color="yellow">It'd be more than this even if they used water for cooking only.</font>

884
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,680
<font color="yellow">Are you really going to do this?</font>

885
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,980
<font color="yellow">I told you to read the meters, and you fabricated the numbers.</font>

886
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,550
<font color="yellow">- I didn't fabricate them. - Yes, you did!</font>

887
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:54,820
<font color="yellow">My eyes became dim.</font>

888
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,880
<font color="yellow">Did I read 6 as 0?</font>

889
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,350
<font color="yellow">- You just keep lying to me. - Stop hitting me.</font>

890
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,650
<font color="yellow">What? 1,004?</font>

891
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,750
<font color="yellow">From 982 to 1,004?</font>

892
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,420
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll give you wings like a real angel.</font>

893
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,150
<font color="yellow">This is the spot for the wings, right?</font>

894
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,050
<font color="yellow">- Here are the wings! - Gosh.</font>

895
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:21,180
<font color="yellow">Well... My grandma told me to give you this.</font>

896
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,680
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

897
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:27,180
<font color="yellow">She said that if you have leftover,</font>

898
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,720
<font color="yellow">you can put it in the freezer and eat it later.</font>

899
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,720
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

900
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:34,020
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, then.</font>

903
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,950
<font color="yellow">Your mom wouldn't cook for us. She wants us to eat on our own.</font>

904
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,850
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Dong Hui. - Hello.</font>

905
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,550
<font color="yellow">That's good. Please stay and eat ramyeon with us.</font>

906
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,580
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

907
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,920
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. Cook three packs of ramyeon.</font>

908
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,980

00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,620
<font color="yellow">- That's... - Please come in.</font>

910
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,780
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

911
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,820
<font color="yellow">- Cook some for me, too. - Me, too.</font>

912
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,780
<font color="yellow">Hi, Dong Hui.</font>

913
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,250
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,750
<font color="yellow">Cook some for me.</font>

915
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,050
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to join us? Go in and count the money.</font>

916
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,250
<font color="yellow">Look at her.</font>

917
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,680
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Eating with all of you makes it so delicious.</font>

918
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,220
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it, Grandma?</font>

919
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,820
<font color="yellow">Hey. Stop eating.</font>

920
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:42,150
<font color="yellow">We should eat, too. You're eating it all.</font>

921
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,420
<font color="yellow">Grandma. I didn't eat that much.</font>

922
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,780
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Your hair looks ridiculous.</font>

923
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,420
<font color="yellow">Who is it? Today is a holiday.</font>

924
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,050
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

925
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:56,720
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. Please come in. - Come this way.</font>

926
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,780
<font color="yellow">Please come this way. How have you been?</font>

927
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,120
<font color="yellow">Why did you make him come over in the weekend?</font>

928
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:09,420
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

929
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,150
<font color="yellow">- You're having ramyeon. - Do you want some, too?</font>

930
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,550
<font color="yellow">- It's okay. - Come on. Have some.</font>

931
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,250
<font color="yellow">Take a seat here.</font>

932
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:19,220
<font color="yellow">Grandma, it's not even enough for us.</font>

933
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,680
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. You really came to fix it.</font>

934
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,880
<font color="yellow">I keep my word.</font>

935
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,320
<font color="yellow">Please have some fruits with us when it's done.</font>

936
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,580
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

937
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,650
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - You're welcome.</font>

938
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,220
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

939
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,780
<font color="yellow">He's such a wonderful guy.</font>

940
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,380
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

941
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,950
<font color="yellow">He's so sincere and reliable.</font>

942
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,520
<font color="yellow">And that sincere and reliable guy let his company go under.</font>

943
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,180
<font color="yellow">What do you mean he let his company go under?</font>

944
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,950
<font color="yellow">Do you know him well?</font>

945
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,150
<font color="yellow">I do. I've met him in New York.</font>

946
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,720
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Really?</font>

947
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,420
<font color="yellow">Then, tell me what happened.</font>

948
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:12,480
<font color="yellow">When did you first meet him?</font>

949
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,820
<font color="yellow">Forget it, Grandma. Just have some fruits.</font>

950
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,820
<font color="yellow">- I've fixed it. - Already?</font>

951
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,680
<font color="yellow">- Then, come have some fruits. - Please come sit.</font>

952
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:25,180
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I'll be leaving, then.</font>

953
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,350
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you... - Goodbye.</font>

954
01:01:28,850 --> 01:01:31,520
<font color="yellow">Please have some fruits...</font>

955
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:34,180
<font color="yellow">What's the matter? Is he angry?</font>

956
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,450
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to do this community service in the weekend?</font>

957
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:53,450
<font color="yellow">They never let me have my day off.</font>

958
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,980
<font color="yellow">I can't believe people dump trash in this national cemetery.</font>

959
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,550
<font color="yellow">It's so shameful.</font>

960
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:07,050
<font color="yellow">Did they wipe tears with this?</font>

961
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,150
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, do you have plans today?</font>

962
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,950
<font color="yellow">I have a private lesson.</font>

963
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,480
<font color="yellow">- Again? - If I don't take it,</font>

964
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:26,980
<font color="yellow">the whole family will be depressed.</font>

965
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,850
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

966
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,180
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, what's wrong?</font>

967
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:37,580
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, wake up.</font>

968
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,720
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, are you okay?</font>

969
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:43,220
<font color="yellow">Please help me!</font>

970
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:45,680
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone? Please help us!</font>

971
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,950
<font color="yellow">Please help!</font>

972
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,920
<font color="yellow">He fainted all of a sudden.</font>

973
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:54,880
<font color="yellow">- He collapsed. - That way.</font>

974
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,680
<font color="yellow">Please help.</font>

975
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:04,650
<font color="yellow">It's Ji Hoon. Come this way.</font>

976
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,650
<font color="yellow">Doctor.</font>

977
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,880
<font color="yellow">Take him to the emergency room.</font>

978
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,020
<font color="yellow">Did you bring Ji Hoon here? Are you his friend?</font>

979
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,520
<font color="yellow">I'm Chang Soo and we're cousins.</font>

980
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:34,480
<font color="yellow">What? Chang Soo?</font>

981
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,020
<font color="yellow">(Han Chang Soo)</font>

982
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,080
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo?</font>

983
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,780
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

984
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,650
<font color="yellow">So you're Chang Soo.</font>

985
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,520
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

986
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,420
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

987
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,280
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. It's me, your mom.</font>

988
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:02,620
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon. - We need to talk.</font>

989
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:18,380
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon has the early stage of septicemia.</font>

990
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,250
<font color="yellow">The early stage of septicemia?</font>

991
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,480
<font color="yellow">Viruses are found in his blood.</font>

992
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,450
<font color="yellow">The blood pressure and blood sugar plunged, and that's why he fainted.</font>

993
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,080
<font color="yellow">Why? Why did he fall ill?</font>

994
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,980
<font color="yellow">You must know better.</font>

995
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,820
<font color="yellow">Fatigue and excessive stress caused malfunction of the immune system.</font>

996
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,580
<font color="yellow">He's been weird recently.</font>

997
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,680
<font color="yellow">So please don't force him to study.</font>

998
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:44,280
<font color="yellow">Min Seok,</font>

999
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,880
<font color="yellow">you're trying to scare me, aren't you?</font>

1000
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:50,420
<font color="yellow">If he got septicemia because he studied, every student must have it.</font>

1001
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:52,550
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is in a critical condition.</font>

1002
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,520
<font color="yellow">He must avoid any stressful situation and have enough rest.</font>

1003
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,480
<font color="yellow">That's why I needed you to talk with me.</font>

1004
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,850
<font color="yellow">He has no time to rest now. He'll take the high school exam in a year.</font>

1005
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:01,950
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook!</font>

1006
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,080
<font color="yellow">When did you come home?</font>

1007
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,780
<font color="yellow">I came home a little late.</font>

1008
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:15,450
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

1009
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,680
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

1010
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:20,320
<font color="yellow">It seems like you worked until late.</font>

1011
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,550
<font color="yellow">Did you have fun at the party?</font>

1012
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:26,550
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - You said you'd go to a party.</font>

1013
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,780
<font color="yellow">Right. I just had dinner and came home early.</font>

1014
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,580
<font color="yellow">Ask Moong Chi. I went up to say hello to her.</font>

1015
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,480
<font color="yellow">Please let me do it.</font>

1016
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,480
<font color="yellow">I'm full and even had fruits.</font>

1017
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,620
<font color="yellow">Let's go see if there's any ways to make money.</font>

1018
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:06,920
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

1019
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,980
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

1020
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,320
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

1021
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,580
<font color="yellow">Tell me what you want.</font>

1022
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,480
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1023
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,650
<font color="yellow">I want to read it. Please let me be...</font>

1024
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:53,180
<font color="yellow">the first one to read your script.</font>

1025
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,820
<font color="yellow">You have an important exam tomorrow.</font>

1026
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:57,680
<font color="yellow">I wish I can switch my mom with his mom.</font>

1027
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,380
<font color="yellow">If you can't defeat your enemy, be its friend.</font>

1028
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,920
<font color="yellow">I'm the one you saw in New York.</font>

1029
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:03,280
<font color="yellow">I'm David Lee.</font>

1030
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,950
<font color="yellow">Please come down first.</font>

1031
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:08,280
<font color="yellow">My mom's going to kill me. I don't want to live any more.</font>

1032
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,920
<font color="yellow">I was smaller than him.</font>

1033
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,320
<font color="yellow">What do you mean our boys are switched?</font>
