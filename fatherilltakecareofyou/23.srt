1
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I am an adoptee.</font>

2
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,798
<font color=#FFFF00>An adoptee from an orphanage.</font>

3
00:00:17,528 --> 00:00:19,328
<font color=#FFFF00>And a brother who's looking for his younger brother...</font>

4
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,598
<font color=#FFFF00>whom he lost 20 years ago.</font>

5
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:25,328
<font color=#FFFF00>That's who I am.</font>

6
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

7
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:31,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

8
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you feel better now?</font>

9
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:38,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

10
00:00:39,428 --> 00:00:41,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know.</font>

11
00:00:41,568 --> 00:00:44,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you had such a painful past.</font>

12
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry for being so immature.</font>

13
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:51,798
<font color=#FFFF00>After 20 years have passed,</font>

14
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:54,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

15
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I can find my brother now.</font>

16
00:00:58,928 --> 00:00:59,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me?</font>

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

18
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:04,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I can find my bother now.</font>

19
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:07,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

20
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:14,868
<font color=#FFFF00>So please trust me and wait a little.</font>

21
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:18,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never make you sad...</font>

22
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:20,098
<font color=#FFFF00>or hurt you again.</font>

23
00:01:22,298 --> 00:01:24,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Please bear with me...</font>

24
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,768
<font color=#FFFF00>until I find my brother.</font>

25
00:01:36,198 --> 00:01:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

26
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I will wait.</font>

27
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:41,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I will bear with you.</font>

28
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Also,</font>

29
00:01:45,998 --> 00:01:47,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I will trust you.</font>

30
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You're no longer the wild girl I used to know.</font>

31
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:58,628
<font color=#FFFF00>The neighborhood will thank me for it.</font>

32
00:02:02,098 --> 00:02:03,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You made it happen.</font>

33
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

34
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you two doing right now?</font>

35
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:21,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you all the way here?</font>

36
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:23,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, I mean Director Han.</font>

37
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:26,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what's happening at the company?</font>

38
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:30,068
<font color=#FFFF00>How can the director be out of reach?</font>

39
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry. I left my phone downstairs.</font>

40
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:35,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

41
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You two are unbelievable.</font>

42
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:39,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

43
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Jo won't work with us.</font>

44
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:43,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

45
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know who she is?</font>

46
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:49,398
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the girl who came the other time.</font>

47
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:50,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that?</font>

48
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:53,268
<font color=#FFFF00>She's Seong Joon's fiance.</font>

49
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:56,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

50
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon said she is not his fiance.</font>

51
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:00,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

52
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:02,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey!</font>

53
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the reason?</font>

54
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:06,268
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a problem with her previous employee.</font>

55
00:03:06,528 --> 00:03:07,828
<font color=#FFFF00>She's contracted to write 10 more episodes for them,</font>

56
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:10,728
<font color=#FFFF00>so we were going to return them the money for those manuscripts.</font>

57
00:03:10,898 --> 00:03:13,928
<font color=#FFFF00>But they claimed the priority right and decided to resign with her.</font>

58
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,528
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

59
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Writer Jo right now?</font>

60
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:20,268
<font color=#FFFF00>She's at the writing room. Her agent is coming too.</font>

61
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,268
<font color=#FFFF00>We're going to have a meeting there.</font>

62
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:25,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up and get ready, Seong Joon. You don't have time to play house.</font>

63
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

64
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:42,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she?</font>

65
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I have to go to the office. There's an emergency.</font>

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

67
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:51,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. Seong Joon.</font>

68
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in a hurry, but I have to ask you a question.</font>

69
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Director.</font>

70
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you two doing?</font>

71
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,498
<font color=#FFFF00>We were studying the script.</font>

72
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say you were studying the script?</font>

73
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:08,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

74
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui,</font>

75
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:13,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't meddle with the family...</font>

76
00:04:13,168 --> 00:04:15,298
<font color=#FFFF00>getting along so well,</font>

77
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,568
<font color=#FFFF00>but I hope you will not get carried away by something personal...</font>

78
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:20,728
<font color=#FFFF00>like this and let it affect your work again.</font>

79
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:22,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

80
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

81
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:29,668
<font color=#FFFF00>My guess was right.</font>

82
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it was you.</font>

83
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:34,228
<font color=#FFFF00>We have an emergency at work,</font>

84
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:37,568
<font color=#FFFF00>and Seong Joon wasn't picking up his phone.</font>

85
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something bad happen at work?</font>

86
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's nothing bad.</font>

87
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It just needs to be addressed right away. That's all.</font>

88
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:48,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It turned out he left his phone downstairs.</font>

89
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Only if Seong Joon...</font>

90
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:52,398
<font color=#FFFF00>had his phone,</font>

91
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:56,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't have ruined your holiday.</font>

92
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

93
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,428
<font color=#FFFF00>You were just doing your work. I understand.</font>

94
00:05:00,898 --> 00:05:03,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I will get going now then.</font>

95
00:05:03,198 --> 00:05:05,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon must be waiting for me downstairs.</font>

96
00:05:05,268 --> 00:05:06,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Go ahead.</font>

97
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll visit you again next time.</font>

98
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Take care.</font>

99
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, do you have time?</font>

100
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

101
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:26,168
<font color=#FFFF00>If I knew they were going to leave so soon,</font>

102
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:29,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't have brought up tea.</font>

103
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Since I brought up two cups of tea, we should drink it together.</font>

104
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

105
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,228
<font color=#FFFF00>It's decorated quite well here.</font>

106
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:48,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Seong Hoon helped us a lot.</font>

107
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:50,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. Seong Hoon...</font>

108
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,068
<font color=#FFFF00>cares a lot about his in-laws.</font>

109
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,368
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you are always busy writing.</font>

110
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you want to get married?</font>

111
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I want to get married?</font>

112
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

113
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You are quite old now.</font>

114
00:06:09,628 --> 00:06:11,328
<font color=#FFFF00>It's time to think about settling down with someone, you know?</font>

115
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet.</font>

116
00:06:14,498 --> 00:06:16,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I've already married off my two sons,</font>

117
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and now there's only Seong Joon left.</font>

118
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:21,968
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

119
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:24,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I want Seong Joon...</font>

120
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:27,028
<font color=#FFFF00>to marry better person than...</font>

121
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,298
<font color=#FFFF00>his brothers.</font>

122
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:33,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how mothers feel, you know?</font>

123
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:37,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Rather than marrying a poor girl who is kind,</font>

124
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I want him to marry a wealthy and educated girl...</font>

125
00:06:40,098 --> 00:06:43,728
<font color=#FFFF00>who was brought up with much love.</font>

126
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I want that kind of a girl to be my daughter-in-law.</font>

127
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,368
<font color=#FFFF00>That will make his marriage life easier too.</font>

128
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:53,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

129
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure...</font>

130
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:57,328
<font color=#FFFF00>you are a clever girl.</font>

131
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:00,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a writer too, so I'm sure you understand...</font>

132
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,368
<font color=#FFFF00>mother's feelings well.</font>

133
00:07:05,268 --> 00:07:06,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

134
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:11,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you marry well too.</font>

135
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't say anything strange...</font>

136
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,468
<font color=#FFFF00>to that girl, did you?</font>

137
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't get to talk to her.</font>

138
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:34,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Something came up at the office, so they rushed off.</font>

139
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:36,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead,</font>

140
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:39,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I had some tea with Dong Hui.</font>

141
00:07:40,698 --> 00:07:42,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you have tea with Dong Hui?</font>

142
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:43,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I just warned her a little.</font>

143
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:45,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What is there to warn her about?</font>

144
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh...</font>

145
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,828
<font color=#FFFF00>educated her children so well.</font>

146
00:07:52,168 --> 00:07:54,128
<font color=#FFFF00>She's flawless.</font>

147
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:56,398
<font color=#FFFF00>She is hardly flawless.</font>

148
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:59,628
<font color=#FFFF00>She spends all day with Seong Joon in that small space.</font>

149
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:01,768
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't even come out for hours.</font>

150
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,068
<font color=#FFFF00>So how can I not warn her?</font>

151
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:08,328
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you imagining?</font>

152
00:08:08,528 --> 00:08:11,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I smell something fishy.</font>

153
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I think there's something going on between them.</font>

154
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:18,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - You don't know anything.</font>

155
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Young people are different.</font>

156
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't care if they are in-laws.</font>

157
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:26,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable.</font>

158
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:28,298
<font color=#FFFF00>And you know Seong Joon.</font>

159
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:31,898
<font color=#FFFF00>He's just like you. He has a soft spot for the weak.</font>

160
00:08:31,968 --> 00:08:34,398
<font color=#FFFF00>So you're saying Seong Joon...</font>

161
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:37,238
<font color=#FFFF00>likes her. Is that what you're saying?</font>

162
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:40,238
<font color=#FFFF00>That can't happen. They are in-laws for crying out loud.</font>

163
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:42,868
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I am taking precautionary measures.</font>

164
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, you should...</font>

165
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:48,738
<font color=#FFFF00>warn Seong Joon too.</font>

166
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

167
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,098
<font color=#FFFF00>We lost her after all.</font>

168
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:19,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't had the faintest idea that this could happen.</font>

169
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:24,068
<font color=#FFFF00>How can they sign 10 more episodes? Their contract already ended.</font>

170
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:27,568
<font color=#FFFF00>She came to us first because she took care of it.</font>

171
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:31,268
<font color=#FFFF00>This is how businesses in this field run.</font>

172
00:09:31,768 --> 00:09:34,168
<font color=#FFFF00>We only have us to blame. We should have been more careful.</font>

173
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:36,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I will try my best to...</font>

174
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:38,498
<font color=#FFFF00>avoid cancellation of the air time we already acquired.</font>

175
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,568
<font color=#FFFF00>However, we must find her replacement right away.</font>

176
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:49,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What is the agenda of the meeting of the shareholders?</font>

177
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,238
<font color=#FFFF00>The biggest agenda is regarding...</font>

178
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Contents and Marketing Department's performance.</font>

179
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,928
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh. How idiotic.</font>

180
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have put them in charge in the first place.</font>

181
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,128
<font color=#FFFF00>They are still young.</font>

182
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:07,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- What else? - The more important agenda is...</font>

183
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:11,028
<font color=#FFFF00>the disappearance of the former president, Park Chang Wook.</font>

184
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>They are so brutal.</font>

185
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:19,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are they so anxious to declare his death?</font>

186
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

187
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,098
<font color=#FFFF00>how many are on my side?</font>

188
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,928
<font color=#FFFF00>It's more than majority,</font>

189
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:30,098
<font color=#FFFF00>but the opposing side is requesting...</font>

190
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,628
<font color=#FFFF00>to disclose the president's will.</font>

191
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:37,238
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Nothing is going my way.</font>

192
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:42,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. You can go now. - Yes, Sir.</font>

193
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:50,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the contract with Writer Jo was nullified.</font>

194
00:10:51,398 --> 00:10:53,598
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you find out?</font>

195
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:55,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It just happened this morning.</font>

196
00:10:55,768 --> 00:10:58,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you are looking down on me,</font>

197
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:01,328
<font color=#FFFF00>that is why Director Han is...</font>

198
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,068
<font color=#FFFF00>not afraid of me.</font>

199
00:11:04,928 --> 00:11:08,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad it happened. The shareholders didn't like...</font>

200
00:11:08,228 --> 00:11:10,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han and Contents Department.</font>

201
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:13,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you can disband the team.</font>

202
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad, I can't do that. - And...</font>

203
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Fire Han Seong Joon now.</font>

204
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,698
<font color=#FFFF00>This is when you accept his resignation letter.</font>

205
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,568
<font color=#FFFF00>We are not supposed to fooled by him like the previous time.</font>

206
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - It's the end of our conversation.</font>

207
00:11:27,668 --> 00:11:30,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, give me some time to regroup.</font>

208
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,498
<font color=#FFFF00>We can manage this crisis. please?</font>

209
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Your pleading won't make any difference.</font>

210
00:11:35,368 --> 00:11:37,428
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you going to handle the meeting with the shareholders?</font>

211
00:11:37,868 --> 00:11:40,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think the shareholders will...</font>

212
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,168
<font color=#FFFF00>let him off easy?</font>

213
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

214
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:17,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have any business with my family?</font>

215
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:22,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you coming home now?</font>

216
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:25,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you here to see Jeong Eun?</font>

217
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,268
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I am not.</font>

218
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, why are you here?</font>

219
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:40,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't seem to figure you out...</font>

220
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:43,028
<font color=#FFFF00>why you are acting like this.</font>

221
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:47,898
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's... - Please go back home.</font>

222
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a good sight to see.</font>

223
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,668
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you doing? - Stay still.</font>

224
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be neat. The professor will see you soon.</font>

225
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:31,928
<font color=#FFFF00>First impression is very important.</font>

226
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:39,668
<font color=#FFFF00>There.</font>

227
00:13:41,098 --> 00:13:43,428
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you ready? - Mom.</font>

228
00:13:43,898 --> 00:13:45,298
<font color=#FFFF00>So today is...</font>

229
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:48,498
<font color=#FFFF00>the day I decide if...</font>

230
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I will sing or do Korean wrestling?</font>

231
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you bring that?</font>

232
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:58,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not certain if I am talented in singing.</font>

233
00:13:58,328 --> 00:13:59,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Why wouldn't you be talented?</font>

234
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:02,428
<font color=#FFFF00>There isn't any reason why you should stay as a bad student.</font>

235
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:05,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not the one to judge your ability.</font>

236
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:07,068
<font color=#FFFF00>The professor is the one to judge.</font>

237
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

238
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Just like I said, be comfortable.</font>

239
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:19,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You should sing just like you usually sing. Did you get that?</font>

240
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:22,498
<font color=#FFFF00>But still. I am nervous, Mom.</font>

241
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:25,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be nervous. It's all right, Chang Soo.</font>

242
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:28,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here for you. Let's cheer up, okay?</font>

243
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:31,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can do it. - Okay. I can do it.</font>

244
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, it's your turn. Go in.</font>

245
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come on. Hurry inside. - Please don't push me, Mom.</font>

246
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:52,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared.</font>

247
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:54,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Go in. Hurry inside.</font>

248
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,798
<font color=#FFFF00>A water bird dances in the blue sky</font>

249
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:07,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, hey</font>

250
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:11,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Row the boat, I need to find her</font>

251
00:15:11,968 --> 00:15:16,198
<font color=#FFFF00>My youth is on the floating boat</font>

252
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:20,198
<font color=#FFFF00>The sunset in Hwangpo River</font>

253
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:24,728
<font color=#FFFF00>It is red</font>

254
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:33,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

255
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:35,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor.</font>

256
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:38,168
<font color=#FFFF00>How is he?</font>

257
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:45,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

258
00:15:47,398 --> 00:15:48,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor?</font>

259
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you step outside? I need to talk to your mother.</font>

260
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:54,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Thank you.</font>

261
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait for me outside.</font>

262
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, what did the professor say?</font>

263
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

264
00:16:44,368 --> 00:16:45,798
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

265
00:16:48,168 --> 00:16:50,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Thank you so much.</font>

266
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:59,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Good job, my Chang Soo. Well done.</font>

267
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:02,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Great work, Chang Soo. Let's go.</font>

268
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:03,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

269
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? Here you go. - Thank you.</font>

270
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:12,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you serious? - Yes, I am serious, Hye Joo.</font>

271
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,768
<font color=#FFFF00>The professor in one of the best university of music...</font>

272
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:17,398
<font color=#FFFF00>recognized Chang Soo's talent.</font>

273
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:19,498
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

274
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:24,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm throwing a party at home. So please come home early.</font>

275
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. I'm so proud of you, Chang Soo.</font>

276
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:31,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

277
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,128
<font color=#FFFF00>- How do you feel, Ms. Oh? - I feel so happy.</font>

278
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:39,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no idea that Chang Soo would have a talent like that.</font>

279
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly. Who knew? Every man for his own trade.</font>

280
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:46,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, he just started.</font>

281
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations, Chang Soo.</font>

282
00:17:48,828 --> 00:17:51,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you could sing so well.</font>

283
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:52,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Nor did I.</font>

284
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:56,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You ought to put all your effort into it now.</font>

285
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Since he started,</font>

286
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>you will be the best opera singer in the world, okay?</font>

287
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I will.</font>

288
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone. Look at this.</font>

289
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- My gosh. How pretty. - What is that?</font>

290
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - Grandmother.</font>

291
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,698
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a celebratory cake for Chang Soo.</font>

292
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:19,028
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness. - It's so pretty.</font>

293
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:21,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - Everyone.</font>

294
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sing for Chang Soo.</font>

295
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,728
<font color=#FFFF00>- What song? - Please clap.</font>

296
00:18:26,968 --> 00:18:29,828
<font color=#FFFF00>In 1, 2, 3.</font>

300
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations - It's for Chang Soo's new life.</font>

301
00:18:40,598 --> 00:18:44,168
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations on his new life - Congratulations on his new life</font>

302
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:47,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations - Congratulations</font>

303
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:51,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- Congratulations on his new life - Congratulations on his new life</font>

304
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- Chang Soo. Blow out the candles. - Okay.</font>

305
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:05,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- My proud Chang Soo. - He's so powerful.</font>

306
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,828
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why he sings well.</font>

307
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, when did you get here?</font>

308
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:12,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mother. I just arrived.</font>

309
00:19:13,128 --> 00:19:15,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you standing there? Come take a seat.</font>

310
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:17,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay, Grandma.</font>

311
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:20,168
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Grandmother, Father and Mother.</font>

312
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:24,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo will cut the cake now.</font>

313
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:25,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Go ahead.</font>

314
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:27,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, cut it nicely.</font>

315
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:32,438
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Father, Mother.</font>

316
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see how nicely Chang Soo cut the cake?</font>

317
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:37,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, thank you so much...</font>

318
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:38,828
<font color=#FFFF00>for preparing a cake for me.</font>

319
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, My son.</font>

320
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give him an applause.</font>

321
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:55,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did she make us to sing the same song so many times?</font>

322
00:19:55,398 --> 00:19:58,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I am also happy Chang Soo discovered his talent,</font>

323
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:01,498
<font color=#FFFF00>but my arms are so tired now.</font>

324
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,198
<font color=#FFFF00>She even asked us if we saw how nicely Chang Soo cut the cake.</font>

325
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:07,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that something to be complimented?</font>

326
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:10,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You know he cut cakes well even when he was little.</font>

327
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:13,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, please understand Hee Sook.</font>

328
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>She did that because she was so happy.</font>

329
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:18,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You know her heart was broken...</font>

330
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:19,568
<font color=#FFFF00>when she sent Ji Hoon to Hye Joo.</font>

331
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,938
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure she's extremely happy to find out about Chang Soo's gift.</font>

332
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:25,568
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right.</font>

333
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:28,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Please understand her.</font>

334
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,168
<font color=#FFFF00>So you mean...</font>

335
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook now has a new goal, right?</font>

336
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly, Mom.</font>

337
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:37,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess she won't bother us anymore, then.</font>

338
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:40,898
<font color=#FFFF00>She will no longer be depressed with a long face...</font>

339
00:20:40,898 --> 00:20:43,228
<font color=#FFFF00>or go into hysterics toward us.</font>

340
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:46,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Since we found out that kids were switched,</font>

341
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been stressed out...</font>

342
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,598
<font color=#FFFF00>because of Hee Sook.</font>

343
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I've been the same too.</font>

344
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:53,938
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

345
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:55,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

346
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's spicy.</font>

347
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, this is the new sauce. Do you want to try some?</font>

348
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe later.</font>

349
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:14,168
<font color=#FFFF00>This was totally unexpected.</font>

350
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:17,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Who on earth would have known if Chang Soo was such talented?</font>

351
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever thought he'd study vocal music?</font>

352
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:29,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

353
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

354
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:40,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying?</font>

355
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:55,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

356
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:03,498
<font color=#FFFF00>For the first time in my life,</font>

357
00:22:04,498 --> 00:22:06,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it was a good choice...</font>

358
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,228
<font color=#FFFF00>to send Chang Soo to Hee Sook.</font>

359
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:12,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

360
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what I mean.</font>

361
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I've raised him for 15 years,</font>

362
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,668
<font color=#FFFF00>but I didn't know...</font>

363
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:21,728
<font color=#FFFF00>what he likes or what he is good at.</font>

364
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:23,828
<font color=#FFFF00>All I did were...</font>

365
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,398
<font color=#FFFF00>nagging him into studying...</font>

366
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:27,998
<font color=#FFFF00>and yelling at him to stop eating.</font>

367
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:32,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't deserve to be a mother.</font>

368
00:22:35,628 --> 00:22:37,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so harsh to yourself.</font>

369
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:39,498
<font color=#FFFF00>But this is the reality.</font>

370
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:41,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook found...</font>

371
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo's talent just in three months...</font>

372
00:22:45,268 --> 00:22:47,498
<font color=#FFFF00>since she started taking care of him.</font>

373
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00>But I have been too indifferent to him...</font>

374
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,398
<font color=#FFFF00>since I gave birth to Ah In.</font>

375
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:00,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Saying I was busy,</font>

376
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:04,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't take care of him well.</font>

377
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:06,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey,</font>

378
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:10,128
<font color=#FFFF00>you know finding and developing talents are Hee Sook's specialty.</font>

379
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,228
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nothing but a mere excuse.</font>

380
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:17,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm also a mother just like her.</font>

381
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,428
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

382
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I had been his mother for the last 15 years.</font>

383
00:23:32,168 --> 00:23:33,498
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

384
00:23:33,768 --> 00:23:36,828
<font color=#FFFF00>do you have any plan...</font>

385
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,298
<font color=#FFFF00>to marry Dong Hui off?</font>

386
00:23:40,828 --> 00:23:41,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

387
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,798
<font color=#FFFF00>She has reached a marriageable age,</font>

388
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,298
<font color=#FFFF00>so I just wondered if you have any plan.</font>

389
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with that question out of the blue?</font>

390
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What in the world are you talking about?</font>

391
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:57,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon also has a girlfriend who I think he'll get married to.</font>

392
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:01,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is also about the same age as Seong Joon,</font>

393
00:24:01,598 --> 00:24:04,628
<font color=#FFFF00>so I just asked if she also has a boyfriend.</font>

394
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:10,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

395
00:24:11,198 --> 00:24:13,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I should marry her off someday.</font>

396
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:41,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you ask her such question?</font>

397
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:43,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

398
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know she doesn't have much money?</font>

399
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:49,468
<font color=#FFFF00>She's staying in the rooftop room in her in-laws' house.</font>

400
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,998
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she afford to marry Dong Hui off now?</font>

401
00:24:52,568 --> 00:24:55,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You mocked her in front of the family.</font>

402
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,668
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to talk later.</font>

403
00:24:57,898 --> 00:24:59,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

404
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:02,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I didn't mean to offend her.</font>

405
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:05,928
<font color=#FFFF00>As I'm considering to marry Seong Joon off soon,</font>

406
00:25:06,198 --> 00:25:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wondered if Dong Hui also has a plan.</font>

407
00:25:08,628 --> 00:25:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you even bother to care about her?</font>

408
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Put yourself in Ms. Oh's shoes.</font>

409
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,298
<font color=#FFFF00>She must have thought you were telling her...</font>

410
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:16,598
<font color=#FFFF00>to marry Dong Hui off...</font>

411
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,668
<font color=#FFFF00>and move to a nursing home because they're bothersome.</font>

412
00:25:20,428 --> 00:25:22,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook isn't the only drama queen, but you are too.</font>

413
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:25,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You two are no different from each other.</font>

414
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:28,668
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what I meant. I asked it for a reason.</font>

415
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,168
<font color=#FFFF00>For a reason?</font>

416
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:31,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it already.</font>

417
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:34,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you yelling at me? Why?</font>

418
00:25:38,428 --> 00:25:39,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma.</font>

419
00:25:40,598 --> 00:25:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Dong Hui.</font>

420
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:45,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here? It's cold outside.</font>

421
00:25:47,268 --> 00:25:48,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

422
00:25:48,898 --> 00:25:51,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I just thought you'd be writing.</font>

423
00:25:52,068 --> 00:25:54,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come inside. It's cold here.</font>

424
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:58,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Let's go in.</font>

425
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,928
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please drink some tea. - Okay.</font>

426
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,968
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your arm?</font>

427
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:10,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it will take a while to recover...</font>

428
00:26:10,728 --> 00:26:12,468
<font color=#FFFF00>since I'm old.</font>

429
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you take the cleaning job? You don't have to work.</font>

430
00:26:16,628 --> 00:26:19,868
<font color=#FFFF00>If I don't, how am I going to help you when you get married?</font>

431
00:26:20,668 --> 00:26:21,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma,</font>

432
00:26:22,198 --> 00:26:23,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to marry.</font>

433
00:26:24,398 --> 00:26:25,998
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

434
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:28,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to live with you like now.</font>

435
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:32,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You know I can't live forever.</font>

436
00:26:32,598 --> 00:26:34,898
<font color=#FFFF00>My scenario will be dramatized soon.</font>

437
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:38,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I might become a sought-after writer when it's aired.</font>

438
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I will just keep writing...</font>

439
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:43,498
<font color=#FFFF00>and live happily with you, Grandma.</font>

440
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you...</font>

441
00:26:52,628 --> 00:26:54,928
<font color=#FFFF00>have a boyfriend?</font>

442
00:26:55,768 --> 00:26:58,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry? No, I don't.</font>

443
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:00,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Then,</font>

444
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:04,168
<font color=#FFFF00>do you have any man...</font>

445
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:05,798
<font color=#FFFF00>of your heart?</font>

446
00:27:07,428 --> 00:27:09,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't. Why are you asking such things?</font>

447
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:13,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel sorry for you.</font>

448
00:27:15,198 --> 00:27:17,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't send you to a college,</font>

449
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:20,128
<font color=#FFFF00>so you are working...</font>

450
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and writing every day.</font>

451
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:24,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't dress up and hang out with your friends.</font>

452
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It breaks my heart...</font>

453
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,868
<font color=#FFFF00>to see you working.</font>

454
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:34,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say that, Grandma.</font>

455
00:27:35,298 --> 00:27:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really happy now.</font>

456
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, why are you crying?</font>

457
00:27:56,628 --> 00:27:58,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is she?</font>

458
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:01,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh.</font>

459
00:28:03,928 --> 00:28:05,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh.</font>

460
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How longer should Dong Hui wait?</font>

461
00:28:10,428 --> 00:28:12,968
<font color=#FFFF00>She turned 27 already.</font>

462
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:17,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You really have to do something with her now.</font>

463
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Please wait a little longer.</font>

464
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It's almost done.</font>

465
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Please hurry up.</font>

466
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:28,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You know my days are numbered.</font>

467
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you not going to sleep?</font>

468
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:33,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

469
00:28:33,228 --> 00:28:34,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing.</font>

470
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:35,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean it's nothing?</font>

471
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:39,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Never mind. - You really smell fishy.</font>

472
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:41,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh, do you have a boyfriend?</font>

473
00:28:45,968 --> 00:28:46,998
<font color=#FFFF00>That night,</font>

474
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to Han River...</font>

475
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,428
<font color=#FFFF00>to do some night fishing.</font>

476
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:54,498
<font color=#FFFF00>On the way, I saw a crying boy.</font>

477
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:56,468
<font color=#FFFF00>He was crying so hard.</font>

478
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

479
00:28:57,698 --> 00:29:00,168
<font color=#FFFF00>- He was wearing only a thin jacket. - Hyun Woo!</font>

480
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:03,068
<font color=#FFFF00>He was wearing shoes, but he wasn't wearing any socks.</font>

481
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

482
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:15,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Sir.</font>

483
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:18,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get any calls from the police?</font>

484
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:21,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, but none yet.</font>

485
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:46,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't do that.</font>

486
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>- You will get scolded. - Really?</font>

487
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be busy preparing for your wedding.</font>

488
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep calling me?</font>

489
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you ask your boyfriend about Golden Street?</font>

490
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:09,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true, isn't it?</font>

491
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:12,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind. I am not going to ask him.</font>

492
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:14,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure he had his reasons.</font>

493
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you keep denying that it's him?</font>

494
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:20,968
<font color=#FFFF00>David Lee is still the CEO of Golden Street.</font>

495
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:24,268
<font color=#FFFF00>- When I went there the other day... - Seon Hwa.</font>

496
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe he's afraid that...</font>

497
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:28,868
<font color=#FFFF00>once girls find out that he's super rich...</font>

498
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,068
<font color=#FFFF00>they won't love him sincerely.</font>

499
00:30:32,728 --> 00:30:33,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

500
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:36,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be killing 2 birds with 1 stone if that's the case.</font>

501
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:38,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I will pretend I'm sincerely in love with him,</font>

502
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:41,328
<font color=#FFFF00>and later when I find out that he's rich, I will get rich too.</font>

503
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:44,268
<font color=#FFFF00>How nice would it be? Right?</font>

504
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:46,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Good luck with your wedding.</font>

505
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:55,628
<font color=#FFFF00>How can they be so selfish and think about only their interests?</font>

506
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,598
<font color=#FFFF00>This is just way over the line.</font>

507
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:01,328
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the Contents Department of FGC.</font>

508
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:04,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I called to find out when Writer Kim's contract will be over.</font>

509
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a lot of other writers.</font>

510
00:31:08,768 --> 00:31:11,068
<font color=#FFFF00>We're asking you to release one writer early.</font>

511
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,268
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not even assigned to any project yet.</font>

512
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:17,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that we don't want to go there.</font>

513
00:31:17,728 --> 00:31:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>We have an emergency here, so we're asking to delay the meeting.</font>

514
00:31:22,498 --> 00:31:24,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we have a meeting, please?</font>

515
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:29,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I will call you back.</font>

516
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:38,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I appreciate the Marketing Team for helping us out.</font>

517
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to Director Bang, we didn't lose the airing right.</font>

518
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:45,168
<font color=#FFFF00>As long as we find a writer and a project,</font>

519
00:31:45,198 --> 00:31:46,468
<font color=#FFFF00>everything will go as planned.</font>

520
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:48,028
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't be too disheartened.</font>

521
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:50,268
<font color=#FFFF00>This crisis...</font>

522
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:52,328
<font color=#FFFF00>might turn into a better opportunity.</font>

523
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,328
<font color=#FFFF00>As you must know, the Contents Marketing Department...</font>

524
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:58,368
<font color=#FFFF00>will be removed if anything goes wrong.</font>

525
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:01,868
<font color=#FFFF00>The general shareholders' meeting will be held soon.</font>

526
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:06,128
<font color=#FFFF00>That meeting will determine the fate of this department.</font>

527
00:32:06,368 --> 00:32:10,228
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I will never waste this last chance.</font>

528
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:11,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for all of us.</font>

529
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,828
<font color=#FFFF00>This is our last chance.</font>

530
00:32:17,098 --> 00:32:18,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's make it work.</font>

531
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:20,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Okay.</font>

532
00:32:21,468 --> 00:32:23,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Producer Kim, please distribute those.</font>

533
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:24,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

534
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:36,468
<font color=#FFFF00>These are the scripts we've been collecting.</font>

535
00:32:36,768 --> 00:32:39,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Please read them thoroughly and choose good ones.</font>

536
00:32:39,498 --> 00:32:43,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I've collected the scripts of both experienced and new writers.</font>

537
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:46,998
<font color=#FFFF00>To make the selection process as fair as possible,</font>

538
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,998
<font color=#FFFF00>we have eliminated the names of the writers.</font>

539
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:52,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it better to go with an experienced writer's script?</font>

540
00:32:53,328 --> 00:32:56,968
<font color=#FFFF00>It's easier for us to do business if the writer is experienced.</font>

541
00:32:57,168 --> 00:33:01,128
<font color=#FFFF00>When we analyze the trend of successful replacement programs,</font>

542
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:04,198
<font color=#FFFF00>we can see that the programs reviewed as being new and...</font>

543
00:33:04,468 --> 00:33:08,168
<font color=#FFFF00>original and received higher ratings were...</font>

544
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:10,728
<font color=#FFFF00>often the works of new writers.</font>

545
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Please read them by tomorrow,</font>

546
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:15,368
<font color=#FFFF00>and we will talk again.</font>

547
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:18,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- By tomorrow? - Please do.</font>

548
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:49,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You're late.</font>

549
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- What now? - Seong Joon.</font>

550
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Can we talk?</font>

551
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:16,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you upset that I brought you here without asking permission?</font>

552
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:19,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

553
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt bad for making you pay last time.</font>

554
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to feel bad.</font>

555
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it that you want to tell me?</font>

556
00:34:41,598 --> 00:34:43,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to ask.</font>

557
00:34:45,768 --> 00:34:49,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you were adopted when you were very little.</font>

558
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:55,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering if you remembered anything before you were adopted.</font>

559
00:34:56,468 --> 00:34:59,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please stop. - Do you remember where you lived?</font>

560
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:00,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Or do you remember your father?</font>

561
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:04,338
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

562
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember your brother?</font>

563
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,838
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you doing? - Please don't be upset.</font>

564
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:15,168
<font color=#FFFF00>If you remember anything, please tell me.</font>

565
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:16,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I beg you.</font>

566
00:35:25,338 --> 00:35:26,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

567
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:29,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

568
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you going after me?</font>

569
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:34,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon,</font>

570
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>please calm down and listen to me.</font>

571
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:40,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you? Why are you so interested in my family?</font>

572
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:43,198
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Joon. - I warned you.</font>

573
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to meddle with my family!</font>

574
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he doing?</font>

575
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Mr. Lee.</font>

576
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:55,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, what are you doing?</font>

577
00:35:57,128 --> 00:35:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave him alone!</font>

578
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:00,838
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - What are you doing?</font>

579
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:04,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right, Mr. Lee?</font>

580
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:13,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on, Boy?</font>

581
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:15,968
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

582
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's my fault. - Dad,</font>

583
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:21,068
<font color=#FFFF00>let's go home.</font>

584
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:23,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home.</font>

585
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,498
<font color=#FFFF00>(Scene 8, Ji Won's House)</font>

586
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:23,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you writing?</font>

587
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

588
00:37:27,568 --> 00:37:30,368
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cold outside. Can I come in?</font>

589
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:35,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Today's been a long day for me.</font>

590
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:40,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me a warm cup of tea.</font>

591
00:37:42,898 --> 00:37:45,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait here. I will go outside.</font>

592
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:02,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something wrong?</font>

593
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:05,628
<font color=#FFFF00>No, nothing is wrong.</font>

594
00:38:07,068 --> 00:38:09,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Well then.</font>

595
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:14,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

596
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:16,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone is reading these.</font>

597
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:20,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You should read them...</font>

598
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,298
<font color=#FFFF00>and see which one is good.</font>

599
00:38:24,398 --> 00:38:26,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it okay for me to read them?</font>

600
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:28,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I trust your judgement.</font>

601
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:33,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I will read them.</font>

602
00:38:36,428 --> 00:38:38,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late. You should go down now.</font>

603
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:43,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go down now. The elders are expecting you.</font>

604
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:45,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

605
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:48,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you today?</font>

606
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you brought it up...</font>

607
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:57,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it would be better if you don't come up here from now on.</font>

608
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why? - You must be tired from work.</font>

609
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I will write on my own from now on.</font>

610
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:09,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Something happened, right?</font>

611
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:13,168
<font color=#FFFF00>No, nothing happened. It's just...</font>

612
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:15,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I didn't think about...</font>

613
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:19,268
<font color=#FFFF00>your situation because I was only thinking about myself.</font>

614
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:23,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have a lot of things to do besides teaching me at night.</font>

615
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:25,798
<font color=#FFFF00>That's...</font>

616
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:27,838
<font color=#FFFF00>my favorite thing to do.</font>

617
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:30,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Teaching you.</font>

618
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:42,968
<font color=#FFFF00>But still,</font>

619
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,028
<font color=#FFFF00>please don't come here anymore.</font>

620
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:49,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

621
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:55,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I will give you a report tomorrow at work.</font>

622
00:40:11,568 --> 00:40:13,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

623
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

624
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:18,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

625
00:40:19,398 --> 00:40:22,728
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sang Woo. - Hyun Woo!</font>

626
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:24,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo!</font>

627
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:38,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir?</font>

628
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:50,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right, Sir?</font>

629
00:40:53,268 --> 00:40:55,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You drank a lot last night.</font>

630
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:57,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I did.</font>

631
00:40:57,838 --> 00:40:58,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I did drink a bit.</font>

632
00:40:59,368 --> 00:41:00,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet Seong Joon?</font>

633
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:03,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I did.</font>

634
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to get a hold of yourself, especially in times like this.</font>

635
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:07,798
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you meet him?</font>

636
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it was a mistake.</font>

637
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:15,798
<font color=#FFFF00>But I couldn't stand it. I was so anxious.</font>

638
00:41:16,198 --> 00:41:17,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You were too hasty.</font>

639
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what do you think I should do?</font>

640
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:22,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm about to lose my mind.</font>

641
00:41:22,628 --> 00:41:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>He grabbed me by the collar and despises me,</font>

642
00:41:25,768 --> 00:41:27,198
<font color=#FFFF00>and he might be my brother.</font>

643
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I supposed I do?</font>

644
00:41:36,428 --> 00:41:37,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go.</font>

645
00:41:38,198 --> 00:41:39,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be in here.</font>

646
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:47,428
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

647
00:41:48,368 --> 00:41:49,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

648
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:52,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope I am not intruding.</font>

649
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:53,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not.</font>

650
00:41:53,868 --> 00:41:55,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I was about to have some coffee.</font>

651
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:57,228
<font color=#FFFF00>- Were you? - Yes.</font>

652
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Could I join you then?</font>

653
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- Of course. Please wait. - Okay.</font>

654
00:42:16,028 --> 00:42:18,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why he did...</font>

655
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>such a thing to you last night.</font>

656
00:42:23,998 --> 00:42:26,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you can be understanding and forgive him.</font>

657
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:29,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked him why he did it,</font>

658
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,698
<font color=#FFFF00>but he didn't say anything.</font>

659
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:35,268
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it was my fault.</font>

660
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:38,498
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very unlike him.</font>

661
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:40,068
<font color=#FFFF00>He's very kind.</font>

662
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>He was...</font>

663
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:45,598
<font color=#FFFF00>so different from his brothers ever since he was young.</font>

664
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:49,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He is considerate and thoughtful.</font>

665
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:51,068
<font color=#FFFF00>He is mature too.</font>

666
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:53,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like...</font>

667
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,228
<font color=#FFFF00>he's the oldest son.</font>

668
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw him the other day.</font>

669
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:02,968
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't go out even on a holiday...</font>

670
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:05,498
<font color=#FFFF00>so that he could play go with his father.</font>

671
00:43:07,428 --> 00:43:10,498
<font color=#FFFF00>When he was about eight years old,</font>

672
00:43:10,928 --> 00:43:12,498
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't go out...</font>

673
00:43:12,928 --> 00:43:15,268
<font color=#FFFF00>and always hover around me.</font>

674
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:18,798
<font color=#FFFF00>So I taught him how to play go.</font>

675
00:43:20,268 --> 00:43:21,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

676
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:25,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I could only win against him until he was 12 years old.</font>

677
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:27,968
<font color=#FFFF00>After that, I kept losing.</font>

678
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:29,868
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how smart he is.</font>

679
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,338
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess he is smart indeed.</font>

680
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I really like him a lot.</font>

681
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:39,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Parental love is...</font>

682
00:43:40,228 --> 00:43:42,368
<font color=#FFFF00>one-sided, isn't it?</font>

683
00:43:44,728 --> 00:43:46,068
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

684
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:50,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like you to give you this Korean traditional sweets and cookies.</font>

685
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I received it over the holidays. It's quite expensive.</font>

686
00:43:52,168 --> 00:43:54,228
<font color=#FFFF00>It goes well with coffee.</font>

687
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't. There's no need, Sir.</font>

688
00:43:57,728 --> 00:43:59,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Please accept it.</font>

689
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:02,928
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all for my son.</font>

690
00:44:04,668 --> 00:44:08,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He would never do anything like it.</font>

691
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:12,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he must be under a lot of stress at work.</font>

692
00:44:13,498 --> 00:44:16,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive him this one time.</font>

693
00:44:25,398 --> 00:44:26,428
<font color=#FFFF00>This is delicious.</font>

694
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you teasing me?</font>

695
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:33,368
<font color=#FFFF00>All we need to do is check the fact.</font>

696
00:44:33,598 --> 00:44:36,668
<font color=#FFFF00>The police has to officially check just one line.</font>

697
00:44:37,598 --> 00:44:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Your hard working of 23 years is about to be...</font>

698
00:44:40,498 --> 00:44:43,198
<font color=#FFFF00>summarized into one sentence.</font>

699
00:44:45,228 --> 00:44:47,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I know waiting can be difficult.</font>

700
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:51,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How about doing something else while you wait for it?</font>

701
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:54,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

702
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:57,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm talking about Jeong Eun.</font>

703
00:44:57,698 --> 00:45:01,728
<font color=#FFFF00>To you, she is just as important as Seong Joon.</font>

704
00:45:01,968 --> 00:45:03,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you implying?</font>

705
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,998
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the only person...</font>

706
00:45:06,398 --> 00:45:08,728
<font color=#FFFF00>who trusts and waits for you...</font>

707
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>even though you're not her family.</font>

708
00:45:11,128 --> 00:45:13,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether you admit or not,</font>

709
00:45:13,498 --> 00:45:15,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe I am right.</font>

710
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:17,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Have some.</font>

711
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:20,598
<font color=#FFFF00>This is good.</font>

712
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:30,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

713
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:32,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

714
00:45:33,028 --> 00:45:34,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really have to ask?</font>

715
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:39,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still mad at me?</font>

716
00:45:40,228 --> 00:45:42,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind me. Just keep going where you were headed.</font>

717
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:44,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

718
00:45:44,798 --> 00:45:47,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop drinking. Please?</font>

719
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me to stay out of your life. Why are you butting in mine?</font>

720
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:56,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It looks like you are going on a date with that guy.</font>

721
00:45:56,428 --> 00:45:58,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be impatient. Just go.</font>

722
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:01,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't get involved in your life.</font>

723
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:03,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Children don't listen to their parents.</font>

724
00:46:04,398 --> 00:46:06,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to fight with you, Mom.</font>

725
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:12,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't think you are all alone and you are lonely.</font>

726
00:46:12,328 --> 00:46:14,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we get along?</font>

727
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,998
<font color=#FFFF00>All we have in this world is each other.</font>

728
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:22,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you've been dating, it sounds like you know everything.</font>

729
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:24,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

730
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:27,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see how long that will last.</font>

731
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:30,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Love?</font>

732
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:32,968
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

733
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:36,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think I was in love once?</font>

734
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

735
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You.</font>

736
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo started learning to be an opera singer. Did you know?</font>

737
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:44,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

738
00:46:45,098 --> 00:46:46,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

739
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:49,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo is learning to be an opera singer.</font>

740
00:46:51,198 --> 00:46:52,368
<font color=#FFFF00>It's funny.</font>

741
00:46:52,928 --> 00:46:55,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I avoided singers all my life.</font>

742
00:46:56,928 --> 00:46:59,968
<font color=#FFFF00>There's another man who sings in our family.</font>

743
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>By the look of it,</font>

744
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to avoid men who sing.</font>

745
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:11,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it remind you about Dad?</font>

746
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it doesn't.</font>

747
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:17,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Go now.</font>

748
00:47:19,568 --> 00:47:21,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You should live your own life.</font>

749
00:47:21,768 --> 00:47:23,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about me.</font>

750
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:27,268
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Music?</font>

751
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:28,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

752
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:31,898
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been doing lately?</font>

753
00:47:32,268 --> 00:47:35,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo is about to be an amazing opera singer,</font>

754
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:37,428
<font color=#FFFF00>but you are not even interested in your own son.</font>

755
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:38,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You come home late all the time now.</font>

756
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:40,668
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to me?</font>

757
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:44,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know...</font>

758
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:46,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo had a talent for singing.</font>

759
00:47:46,628 --> 00:47:49,128
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - I'm busy too.</font>

760
00:47:49,498 --> 00:47:51,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know how much work I have?</font>

761
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:54,328
<font color=#FFFF00>To put it bluntly, if he wants to become an opera singer,</font>

762
00:47:54,598 --> 00:47:57,428
<font color=#FFFF00>who's going to pay for all those lessons? Are you going to pay?</font>

763
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to pay them eventually.</font>

764
00:48:00,698 --> 00:48:03,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I must go out and work. Should I just stay at home?</font>

765
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:06,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. In times like this,</font>

766
00:48:06,498 --> 00:48:09,898
<font color=#FFFF00>we have to separate our jobs more clearly.</font>

767
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:12,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You are in charge of our son's education.</font>

768
00:48:12,398 --> 00:48:14,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I am in charge of making a lot of money...</font>

769
00:48:14,198 --> 00:48:16,568
<font color=#FFFF00>so that we can raise Chang Soo well.</font>

770
00:48:16,568 --> 00:48:19,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I should also expand my influence.</font>

771
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:22,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Mark my words. I will do my best...</font>

772
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:24,298
<font color=#FFFF00>so that Chang Soo can sing the...</font>

773
00:48:24,628 --> 00:48:28,068
<font color=#FFFF00>national anthem at the President's inauguration after 10 years.</font>

774
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:31,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to the gym.</font>

775
00:48:32,268 --> 00:48:33,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Where are you going?</font>

776
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - Hold on.</font>

777
00:48:58,198 --> 00:48:59,268
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that just now?</font>

778
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:02,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't he know that having small muscles is in trend now?</font>

779
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:13,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han. Here.</font>

780
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:35,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so late? I was waiting for you.</font>

781
00:49:39,468 --> 00:49:40,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

782
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you finished with exercising?</font>

783
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I'm a work out buff.</font>

784
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't done far from enough.</font>

785
00:49:47,898 --> 00:49:50,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll move to that area. Please follow me.</font>

786
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

787
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You should pull it like this.</font>

788
00:50:06,968 --> 00:50:08,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Please keep up.</font>

789
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,428
<font color=#FFFF00>You're unbelievably weak.</font>

790
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

791
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:26,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Try it again. - Okay.</font>

792
00:50:39,698 --> 00:50:40,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all this?</font>

793
00:50:41,098 --> 00:50:42,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see them?</font>

794
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:46,598
<font color=#FFFF00>These are a CD, a book of opera scores, and an opera textbook.</font>

795
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,598
<font color=#FFFF00>These are autobiographies of great opera singers.</font>

796
00:50:49,668 --> 00:50:52,668
<font color=#FFFF00>And these are English and math workbooks for Ji Hoon.</font>

797
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:55,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you giving these to me?</font>

798
00:50:55,168 --> 00:50:58,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You should become a good mother too.</font>

799
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:01,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You should thank me.</font>

800
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,968
<font color=#FFFF00>If it weren't for me,</font>

801
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>you would have never been able to discover Chang Soo's talent.</font>

802
00:51:06,098 --> 00:51:09,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't even had time to visit your kids' schools.</font>

803
00:51:09,168 --> 00:51:11,728
<font color=#FFFF00>- You still don't have time, right? - So what?</font>

804
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be even busier because of Chang Soo.</font>

805
00:51:14,998 --> 00:51:19,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It's crucial to find a good instructor.</font>

806
00:51:19,298 --> 00:51:22,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Professor Park you met the other day?</font>

807
00:51:22,728 --> 00:51:26,128
<font color=#FFFF00>It's illegal to receive lessons from college professors.</font>

808
00:51:27,268 --> 00:51:28,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

809
00:51:28,428 --> 00:51:31,228
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not easy to find a good teacher.</font>

810
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:35,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Although I know nothing about classical music,</font>

811
00:51:35,628 --> 00:51:38,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find the best teacher for Chang Soo by any means...</font>

812
00:51:39,098 --> 00:51:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>with the skills I've earned when I took care of Ji Hoon.</font>

813
00:51:43,298 --> 00:51:46,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- How will you do that? - I already contacted some.</font>

814
00:51:48,298 --> 00:51:49,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You're really amazing.</font>

815
00:51:51,328 --> 00:51:54,028
<font color=#FFFF00>So I need you to listen to this CD...</font>

816
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,898
<font color=#FFFF00>and study opera music...</font>

817
00:51:55,968 --> 00:51:59,068
<font color=#FFFF00>while I am away.</font>

818
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:02,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee Sook, I... - Don't you want...</font>

819
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:04,598
<font color=#FFFF00>to raise Chang Soo into a great opera singer?</font>

820
00:52:06,398 --> 00:52:08,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Fine. - And...</font>

821
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:11,628
<font color=#FFFF00>you also need to take care of your own son,</font>

822
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,468
<font color=#FFFF00>not just other's son.</font>

823
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:19,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell Ji Hoon to finish these in a week and bring them to me.</font>

824
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:22,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee Sook. - Or I won't be able...</font>

825
00:52:22,298 --> 00:52:24,698
<font color=#FFFF00>to completely pay attention to Chang Soo.</font>

826
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I will.</font>

827
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:33,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Have him to read them thoroughly and meticulously.</font>

828
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:35,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

829
00:52:37,298 --> 00:52:39,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I will come late tonight.</font>

830
00:52:40,298 --> 00:52:41,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find a good instructor...</font>

831
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>in a couple of days no matter what.</font>

832
00:52:46,198 --> 00:52:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo. - Yes?</font>

833
00:52:47,628 --> 00:52:51,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Please make kids dinner and clean this floor.</font>

834
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I also need you to wash Chang Soo's clothes.</font>

835
00:52:54,198 --> 00:52:55,268
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

836
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm counting on you.</font>

837
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:00,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

838
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook!</font>

839
00:53:22,898 --> 00:53:25,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I can master classical music.</font>

840
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,228
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't hard.</font>

841
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,268
<font color=#FFFF00>My jaw is dislocated.</font>

842
00:54:17,498 --> 00:54:19,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, what are you doing?</font>

843
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:22,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you turn the fan on?</font>

844
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:24,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just trying a new way.</font>

845
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:28,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

846
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:32,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you really not finish these workbooks?</font>

847
00:54:32,628 --> 00:54:34,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm doing this for you.</font>

848
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to do it.</font>

849
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:39,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Your former mom said...</font>

850
00:54:39,398 --> 00:54:41,198
<font color=#FFFF00>she will get me...</font>

851
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,628
<font color=#FFFF00>if I fail to have you finish these in a week.</font>

852
00:54:44,068 --> 00:54:46,568
<font color=#FFFF00>It's you who said I don't have to study hard.</font>

853
00:54:46,898 --> 00:54:48,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't keep two tongues in one mouth.</font>

854
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>He's driving me crazy.</font>

855
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook will kill both of us...</font>

856
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,128
<font color=#FFFF00>if he doesn't finish these.</font>

857
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:01,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, I can do it.</font>

858
00:55:01,728 --> 00:55:04,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's okay. - Let me do it. Your arm isn't well.</font>

859
00:55:10,068 --> 00:55:11,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

860
00:55:11,768 --> 00:55:13,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's eat.</font>

861
00:55:16,328 --> 00:55:17,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat a lot.</font>

862
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat up and work harder.</font>

863
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:22,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, you will become a good writer soon...</font>

864
00:55:23,168 --> 00:55:25,428
<font color=#FFFF00>and get married too.</font>

865
00:55:25,468 --> 00:55:28,828
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandma. - Eat up.</font>

866
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I came up here...</font>

867
00:55:32,368 --> 00:55:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>just to make you lunch.</font>

868
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. Thank you. - You're welcome.</font>

869
00:55:36,868 --> 00:55:39,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dig in. Eat a lot.</font>

870
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:47,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, it's really good.</font>

871
00:55:47,828 --> 00:55:50,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Your soybean paste stew is the best ever.</font>

872
00:55:50,628 --> 00:55:51,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

873
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:57,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Mi Joo?</font>

874
00:55:57,798 --> 00:55:59,398
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she'll come late.</font>

875
00:56:01,268 --> 00:56:03,098
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how hard she works,</font>

876
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,998
<font color=#FFFF00>the Contents Team will never be able to revive.</font>

877
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:18,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me,</font>

878
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,568
<font color=#FFFF00>where did you get this fermented soybean paste?</font>

879
00:56:21,898 --> 00:56:24,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo said one of her colleague...</font>

880
00:56:24,268 --> 00:56:26,828
<font color=#FFFF00>gave it to her.</font>

881
00:56:27,328 --> 00:56:28,728
<font color=#FFFF00>- Her colleague worker? - Yes.</font>

882
00:56:45,868 --> 00:56:46,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's beautiful.</font>

883
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's awesome.</font>

884
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:52,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you like it? - I do.</font>

885
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:55,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's even more beautiful than the cabin in Quebec, Canada.</font>

886
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Quebec?</font>

887
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You exaggerated too much.</font>

888
00:57:00,498 --> 00:57:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean it's truly amazing.</font>

889
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. You scared me.</font>

890
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:08,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

891
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:12,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- After you. - Thank you.</font>

892
00:57:22,128 --> 00:57:23,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so pretty.</font>

893
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:26,128
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so wonderful to be on a trip by ourselves.</font>

894
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:31,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Was there anyone else when we went camping before?</font>

895
00:57:33,498 --> 00:57:36,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I spent the night all alone.</font>

896
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:39,328
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

897
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:42,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not going to leave me again, right?</font>

898
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:45,428
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a little scary since we're deep in the forest.</font>

899
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:50,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I'll be with you.</font>

900
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:53,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon? - I'm hungry.</font>

901
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:56,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go eat something.</font>

902
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:58,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

903
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have anything you want to know about me?</font>

904
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:10,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

905
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:12,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you tell me everything then?</font>

906
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:17,328
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I will tell you exactly as much as you tell me.</font>

907
00:58:17,768 --> 00:58:19,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never played hard to get.</font>

908
00:58:20,068 --> 00:58:22,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should change this time.</font>

909
00:58:25,598 --> 00:58:27,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Then let's be fair to each other.</font>

910
00:58:28,198 --> 00:58:31,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's answer honestly to each other's questions.</font>

911
00:58:31,268 --> 00:58:32,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it like "Truth or Dare"?</font>

912
00:58:33,498 --> 00:58:34,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You can call it if you want.</font>

913
00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:36,298
<font color=#FFFF00>That sounds great.</font>

914
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:38,568
<font color=#FFFF00>When and who did you fall in love with for the first time?</font>

915
00:58:38,628 --> 00:58:39,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

916
00:58:47,228 --> 00:58:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I liked a girl in my class when I was 14.</font>

917
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:52,298
<font color=#FFFF00>She had brown hair and green eyes.</font>

918
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:55,098
<font color=#FFFF00>She had freckles on her face and British accent.</font>

919
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You still remember every detail.</font>

920
00:58:58,698 --> 00:58:59,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Was there anyone else?</font>

921
00:59:05,398 --> 00:59:06,868
<font color=#FFFF00>It's countless.</font>

922
00:59:07,228 --> 00:59:09,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop showing off!</font>

923
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:15,428
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your turn now.</font>

924
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:16,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's your last boyfriend?</font>

925
00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:18,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

926
00:59:20,768 --> 00:59:22,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You should tell the truth.</font>

927
00:59:24,598 --> 00:59:26,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I've dated a man for three months.</font>

928
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:28,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I met him at a music band...</font>

929
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:30,798
<font color=#FFFF00>before I go on a world travel.</font>

930
00:59:31,228 --> 00:59:32,628
<font color=#FFFF00>He dumped me.</font>

931
00:59:37,368 --> 00:59:39,368
<font color=#FFFF00>It was a get-over travel then.</font>

932
00:59:40,498 --> 00:59:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have liked him a lot.</font>

933
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:46,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You dated him for 3 months and traveled around for 3 years.</font>

934
00:59:48,728 --> 00:59:50,468
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you feel sad the most?</font>

935
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,268
<font color=#FFFF00>When I found out I don't have a dad.</font>

936
00:59:58,068 --> 00:59:59,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you like me?</font>

937
01:00:02,428 --> 01:00:04,828
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the most important question.</font>

938
01:00:05,598 --> 01:00:07,428
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't answer this,</font>

939
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:10,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll dump you this time.</font>

940
01:00:11,498 --> 01:00:12,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you're attractive.</font>

941
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:16,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems that you can do many kinds of things very well.</font>

942
01:00:16,698 --> 01:00:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You cook well, you handle logs well,</font>

943
01:00:19,928 --> 01:00:21,268
<font color=#FFFF00>you make fire well,</font>

944
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:23,898
<font color=#FFFF00>and you listen to my song well.</font>

945
01:00:25,728 --> 01:00:27,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I've had such a hard time...</font>

946
01:00:28,068 --> 01:00:29,628
<font color=#FFFF00>listening to someone sing all along.</font>

947
01:00:29,628 --> 01:00:30,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

948
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:43,928
<font color=#FFFF00>The children in the orphanage...</font>

949
01:00:44,998 --> 01:00:46,868
<font color=#FFFF00>envy those who are adopted.</font>

950
01:00:48,828 --> 01:00:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>They can have parents, a new house,</font>

951
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:54,268
<font color=#FFFF00>and a new family.</font>

952
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:58,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Above all, they can leave the orphanage.</font>

953
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:02,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I can understand.</font>

954
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,368
<font color=#FFFF00>However, the adopted children...</font>

955
01:01:07,198 --> 01:01:08,828
<font color=#FFFF00>get to face a fierce life.</font>

956
01:01:10,468 --> 01:01:11,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

957
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:14,898
<font color=#FFFF00>They wonder...</font>

958
01:01:15,698 --> 01:01:18,468
<font color=#FFFF00>whether they are not good enough for new parents.</font>

959
01:01:20,168 --> 01:01:21,328
<font color=#FFFF00>They wonder...</font>

960
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:23,928
<font color=#FFFF00>whether they are shameful for new parents.</font>

961
01:01:27,168 --> 01:01:28,198
<font color=#FFFF00>They also wonder...</font>

962
01:01:29,028 --> 01:01:30,498
<font color=#FFFF00>whether they might be abandoned again.</font>

963
01:01:36,098 --> 01:01:37,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I was like that too.</font>

964
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:43,568
<font color=#FFFF00>So I had to be the top in everything...</font>

965
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:45,698
<font color=#FFFF00>and I had to be...</font>

966
01:01:46,228 --> 01:01:47,368
<font color=#FFFF00>the best in everything.</font>

967
01:01:49,698 --> 01:01:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I tried my best...</font>

968
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,628
<font color=#FFFF00>not to lose favor of the foster parents.</font>

969
01:01:54,268 --> 01:01:56,368
<font color=#FFFF00>So I got to do everything well.</font>

970
01:01:57,728 --> 01:01:59,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that I was born that way.</font>

971
01:02:00,168 --> 01:02:01,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to survive.</font>

972
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:04,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

973
01:02:05,468 --> 01:02:06,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I'm disappointed...</font>

974
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:09,498
<font color=#FFFF00>that you like me for such a reason.</font>

975
01:02:16,868 --> 01:02:17,998
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact,</font>

976
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:21,268
<font color=#FFFF00>just because.</font>

977
01:02:22,168 --> 01:02:23,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have any reason.</font>

978
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:25,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

979
01:02:26,198 --> 01:02:28,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I like you with no reason.</font>

980
01:02:40,968 --> 01:02:43,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What if I'm the worst man in the world?</font>

981
01:02:45,568 --> 01:02:46,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care.</font>

982
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:49,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I trust you.</font>

983
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:53,168
<font color=#FFFF00>And...</font>

984
01:02:54,828 --> 01:02:56,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I can also feel...</font>

985
01:02:56,998 --> 01:02:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>your pain.</font>

986
01:03:00,498 --> 01:03:03,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I sincerely hope you can find...</font>

987
01:03:03,598 --> 01:03:04,868
<font color=#FFFF00>your brother...</font>

988
01:03:05,768 --> 01:03:07,828
<font color=#FFFF00>that you've been looking for such a long time.</font>

989
01:03:09,498 --> 01:03:11,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything will be all right.</font>

990
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:13,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll find your brother soon.</font>

991
01:03:14,998 --> 01:03:16,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Because...</font>

992
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:20,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I truly wish...</font>

993
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:22,498
<font color=#FFFF00>you can be happier.</font>

994
01:04:44,468 --> 01:04:46,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you open your eyes?</font>

995
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:48,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What if you fall down?</font>

996
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

997
01:04:53,168 --> 01:04:54,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You're being childish.</font>

998
01:04:56,498 --> 01:04:57,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you...</font>

999
01:04:57,868 --> 01:05:00,628
<font color=#FFFF00>not to talk to me by the time we arrive home.</font>

1000
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:02,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you?</font>

1001
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:12,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, uncle.</font>

1002
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:15,028
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1003
01:05:17,768 --> 01:05:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seocho Police Station)</font>

1004
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:26,498
<font color=#FFFF00>We had such a hard time finding him.</font>

1005
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he the child?</font>

1006
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, he is.</font>

1007
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,898
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my brother, Sang Woo.</font>

1008
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:58,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

1009
01:05:59,698 --> 01:06:01,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad that he's the one.</font>

1010
01:06:02,398 --> 01:06:05,698
<font color=#FFFF00>He was sent to a nearby orphanage according to the record.</font>

1011
01:06:07,168 --> 01:06:09,768
<font color=#FFFF00>A man who went for the fishing found him.</font>

1012
01:06:28,098 --> 01:06:29,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

1013
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:03,398
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1014
01:07:03,668 --> 01:07:05,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Just go, Hyun Woo.</font>

1015
01:07:06,368 --> 01:07:09,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You should call your brother's name at least once.</font>

1016
01:07:09,228 --> 01:07:11,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is Sang Woo?</font>

1017
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:14,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He's my brother.</font>

1018
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:16,928
<font color=#FFFF00>So, have you found your brother?</font>

1019
01:07:17,398 --> 01:07:19,728
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not a millionaire's daughter.</font>

1020
01:07:20,698 --> 01:07:21,768
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you?</font>

1021
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:23,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am!</font>

1022
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:25,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's the writer?</font>

1023
01:07:25,328 --> 01:07:26,468
<font color=#FFFF00>The writer is...</font>

1024
01:07:26,468 --> 01:07:29,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think this company exists for your dating?</font>
