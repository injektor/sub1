00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:16,096
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Do you still not get what I said?</font>

2
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:18,144
<font color="yellow">Don't you know why I am doing this?</font>

3
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,744
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - I don't want to listen to you.</font>

4
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,544
<font color="yellow">I like you, Seong Joon. I love you.</font>

5
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,514
<font color="yellow">So don't try to persuade me with those words.</font>

6
00:00:27,144 --> 00:00:29,714
<font color="yellow">Just think about when you used to like me.</font>

7
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:31,574
<font color="yellow">That's enough for me.</font>

8
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,344
<font color="yellow">Seriously, what's wrong with you?</font>

9
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:35,374
<font color="yellow">Do you have to do this?</font>

10
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:36,984
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

11
00:00:37,114 --> 00:00:38,374
<font color="yellow">What do you want me to do?</font>

12
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,744
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to resign?</font>

13
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:42,144
<font color="yellow">Is that what you want?</font>

14
00:01:12,944 --> 00:01:14,444
<font color="yellow">(Episode 17)</font>

15
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:20,414
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you really the one...</font>

16
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,914
<font color="yellow">who got me into the hotel?</font>

17
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:25,244
<font color="yellow">I feel so sorry, and I thank you a lot for it.</font>

18
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:27,744
<font color="yellow">I was glad to do it.</font>

19
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,974
<font color="yellow">By the way, you don't have to be nervous today.</font>

20
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:32,514
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

21
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:38,214
<font color="yellow">I've been on TV countless times. I shouldn't get nervous.</font>

22
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:44,344
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

23
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:48,114
<font color="yellow">who exactly are we meeting today?</font>

24
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:50,444
<font color="yellow">You will find out soon.</font>

25
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:52,944
<font color="yellow">Let's go in.</font>

26
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,844
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

27
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:03,744
<font color="yellow">This is the room.</font>

28
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:09,144
<font color="yellow">You're early. We apologize for arriving late.</font>

29
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:11,014
<font color="yellow">Welcome. Take a seat.</font>

30
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,044
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

31
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,544
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

32
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,614
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, the chairman of Seonghan Group...</font>

33
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:35,214
<font color="yellow">and Mr. Kim Young Tae, the floor leader.</font>

34
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:36,874
<font color="yellow">He's a new face.</font>

35
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,944
<font color="yellow">I told you to bring a former judge or prosecutor.</font>

36
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:46,974
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't know him.</font>

37
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:50,174
<font color="yellow">He's quite famous in media.</font>

38
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:51,714
<font color="yellow">Am I right?</font>

39
00:02:52,974 --> 00:02:54,944
<font color="yellow">You are right. You saw him well.</font>

40
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:59,214
<font color="yellow">Please trust my judgement.</font>

41
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,444
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

42
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:05,114
<font color="yellow">I am known as the handsome lawyer Han Seong Sik...</font>

43
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:06,814
<font color="yellow">from Seoul National University.</font>

44
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:08,544
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

45
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:12,374
<font color="yellow">Did you study law at Seoul National University, too?</font>

46
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,344
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

47
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:18,544
<font color="yellow">You and Mr. Kim went to same school.</font>

48
00:03:19,214 --> 00:03:20,244
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

49
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:22,914
<font color="yellow">What a pleasant surprise.</font>

50
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:24,444
<font color="yellow">Indeed.</font>

51
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:29,114
<font color="yellow">I am truly honored to meet...</font>

52
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:32,414
<font color="yellow">the nation's most respected businessman and...</font>

53
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,074
<font color="yellow">a fellow graduate from my Alma mater.</font>

54
00:03:55,274 --> 00:03:56,474
<font color="yellow">Please give me one large pop corn.</font>

55
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:10,514
<font color="yellow">Ta-da. I arrived at the cinema.</font>

56
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:19,944
<font color="yellow">If you follow what I said, I guarantee that you will...</font>

57
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:23,114
<font color="yellow">avoid any legal problems.</font>

58
00:04:25,144 --> 00:04:27,914
<font color="yellow">Your eye for people is truly admirable.</font>

59
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:30,444
<font color="yellow">You're too generous.</font>

60
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:32,414
<font color="yellow">I'll pour you a drink.</font>

61
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,944
<font color="yellow">Sure. Thank you, Sir.</font>

62
00:04:36,574 --> 00:04:40,174
<font color="yellow">By the way, you should open a private practice.</font>

63
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:47,214
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been long since I quit my job in media.</font>

64
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,844
<font color="yellow">Why would you quit? You should continue.</font>

65
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,044
<font color="yellow">Yes. But...</font>

66
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:54,344
<font color="yellow">I was laid off during the restructuring.</font>

67
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:57,414
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

68
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,774
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim,</font>

69
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,714
<font color="yellow">shouldn't you help your handsome junior...</font>

70
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,074
<font color="yellow">to continue working in media?</font>

71
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:04,244
<font color="yellow">Of course I should.</font>

72
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:07,414
<font color="yellow">I should make a call for you.</font>

73
00:05:10,574 --> 00:05:13,744
<font color="yellow">People have to play in the big water.</font>

74
00:05:14,074 --> 00:05:16,214
<font color="yellow">You should open a private practice first.</font>

75
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,344
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

76
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,544
<font color="yellow">You need a base to build your empire. Don't you agree?</font>

77
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:26,014
<font color="yellow">After years of working in media, you should be ready to join politics.</font>

78
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,074
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

79
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:31,274
<font color="yellow">Politics, did you say?</font>

80
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:45,474
<font color="yellow">I already ate half the bucket, and the movie already began.</font>

81
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,114
<font color="yellow">Maybe he's not coming.</font>

82
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:10,314
<font color="yellow">You're right. It's just like what you said, Sir.</font>

83
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,244
<font color="yellow">- Is that right? - Yes.</font>

84
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:18,674
<font color="yellow">He's very funny, isn't he?</font>

85
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:24,274
<font color="yellow">I have another appointment to attend, so I'll leave first.</font>

86
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:28,914
<font color="yellow">You should get going, then.</font>

87
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:32,914
<font color="yellow">I hope you three will have a great time.</font>

88
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:34,214
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - All right.</font>

89
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:36,944
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

90
00:06:39,014 --> 00:06:40,714
<font color="yellow">He's very funny.</font>

91
00:06:40,714 --> 00:06:42,714
<font color="yellow">- He surely is. - Isn't he, Mr. Lee?</font>

92
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:46,514
<font color="yellow">Yes. I will serve you well.</font>

93
00:07:17,744 --> 00:07:19,314
<font color="yellow">He really didn't come.</font>

94
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,614
<font color="yellow">This is what happens to me.</font>

95
00:07:39,714 --> 00:07:41,074
<font color="yellow">But he's too mean.</font>

96
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:09,774
<font color="yellow">I should go now.</font>

97
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:27,014
<font color="yellow">You're too late.</font>

98
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,674
<font color="yellow">Let's watch movie another time.</font>

99
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,374
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

100
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:49,714
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go out with me?</font>

101
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,214
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you talking?</font>

102
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:29,544
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun I know never stops talking.</font>

103
00:09:32,774 --> 00:09:35,484
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm always talkative?</font>

104
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:37,984
<font color="yellow">After making me wait for such a long time,</font>

105
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:40,044
<font color="yellow">you suddenly appeared and asked me to go out with you.</font>

106
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,544
<font color="yellow">So I am in shock right now.</font>

107
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:45,514
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

108
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:49,014
<font color="yellow">Should we not go out, then?</font>

109
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:52,614
<font color="yellow">No. That's not what I mean.</font>

110
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,114
<font color="yellow">Why are you passing by it? I need to get off.</font>

111
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:05,244
<font color="yellow">It's cold today. You should sleep in the house.</font>

112
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:09,874
<font color="yellow">Sleep in the house.</font>

113
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,744
<font color="yellow">A lady shouldn't be sleeping anywhere.</font>

114
00:10:39,674 --> 00:10:40,814
<font color="yellow">So this is your house.</font>

115
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,014
<font color="yellow">It's my mom's house.</font>

116
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:44,984
<font color="yellow">Your mom's at home, so you should...</font>

117
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:46,914
<font color="yellow">sleep in your house from now on.</font>

118
00:10:51,514 --> 00:10:52,514
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:58,714
<font color="yellow">Can I ask you a question?</font>

120
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,544
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to go out with me?</font>

121
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:08,344
<font color="yellow">I want to know too.</font>

122
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:11,944
<font color="yellow">You're the most unsettled and the loudest person.</font>

123
00:11:12,344 --> 00:11:14,844
<font color="yellow">I don't know why I suddenly came up with the urge to go out with you.</font>

124
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,214
<font color="yellow">I am curious about that, too.</font>

125
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:21,474
<font color="yellow">I need to go home and think about it all night.</font>

126
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:28,074
<font color="yellow">I'm going. Good night.</font>

127
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:30,874
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

128
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:35,914
<font color="yellow">Then this is our first day of being together, right?</font>

129
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:37,674
<font color="yellow">It's our first day together. Right?</font>

130
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,814
<font color="yellow">I'm going to count until Day 100.</font>

131
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:43,974
<font color="yellow">I'm going to count until Day 300.</font>

132
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:47,574
<font color="yellow">I'm going to count until Day 1,000, too. Be ready.</font>

133
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,214
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

134
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,574
<font color="yellow">Bye, Hyun Woo.</font>

135
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,444
<font color="yellow">Thank you for today.</font>

136
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,814
<font color="yellow">Let's watch a movie together next time.</font>

137
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:00,314
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

138
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,744
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Atty. Han. - Hello?</font>

139
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:29,144
<font color="yellow">Perhaps I'm being a nuisance. You must be busy.</font>

140
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:31,744
<font color="yellow">No, you are not.</font>

141
00:12:32,214 --> 00:12:34,344
<font color="yellow">Did it go well yesterday?</font>

142
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,514
<font color="yellow">I should have stayed with you.</font>

143
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,614
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

144
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:41,144
<font color="yellow">I'm thankful for introducing them to me.</font>

145
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:45,274
<font color="yellow">I never imagined that I'd have the chance to meet those people.</font>

146
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:47,844
<font color="yellow">I sincerely appreciate it.</font>

147
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,644
<font color="yellow">I'm honored that I got to help you.</font>

148
00:12:53,544 --> 00:12:55,674
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

149
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:59,714
<font color="yellow">Did you forget? I'm your fan.</font>

150
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:02,644
<font color="yellow">Fan...</font>

151
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:10,714
<font color="yellow">What is your plan now?</font>

152
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:13,074
<font color="yellow">Now that you mentioned it...</font>

153
00:13:16,614 --> 00:13:19,644
<font color="yellow">Like what Mr. Kim suggested,</font>

154
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:23,114
<font color="yellow">I think I should open a private practice.</font>

155
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:29,014
<font color="yellow">I need a base to do something great.</font>

156
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:33,374
<font color="yellow">I lost my job, and I have nowhere to go in the morning anyway.</font>

157
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:38,274
<font color="yellow">Either to offer legal advices to Seonghan Group or join...</font>

158
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:42,714
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim's party, I need an office.</font>

159
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:45,514
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

160
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,014
<font color="yellow">So I thought...</font>

161
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:51,144
<font color="yellow">I heard your uncle...</font>

162
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:54,244
<font color="yellow">owns a lot of buildings in Bangbae-dong.</font>

163
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:57,944
<font color="yellow">Do you think he can lease me a good place at a cheap price?</font>

164
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:00,914
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

165
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:04,674
<font color="yellow">I wondered if he could help me.</font>

166
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,044
<font color="yellow">Don't you worry about it.</font>

167
00:14:10,544 --> 00:14:13,074
<font color="yellow">I will ask my uncle.</font>

168
00:14:16,714 --> 00:14:17,814
<font color="yellow">Will you really do that?</font>

169
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,174
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

170
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:23,044
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. Thank you.</font>

171
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,814
<font color="yellow">I will call you again tomorrow.</font>

172
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,074
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

173
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:43,544
<font color="yellow">My mom...</font>

174
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,714
<font color="yellow">has good sense of style.</font>

175
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,314
<font color="yellow">What are you looking for?</font>

176
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,474
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

177
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,044
<font color="yellow">It's for a grumpy woman in her 60s.</font>

178
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,774
<font color="yellow">It can't be the same as what other people wear.</font>

179
00:14:57,944 --> 00:14:58,974
<font color="yellow">How should I say it?</font>

180
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:02,444
<font color="yellow">Is there something special?</font>

181
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,074
<font color="yellow">He's no fun.</font>

182
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:09,274
<font color="yellow">I lost my interest. He fell for it too easily.</font>

183
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:12,474
<font color="yellow">However, it didn't cost you as much as it did...</font>

184
00:15:12,914 --> 00:15:14,714
<font color="yellow">when you acquired Jinsung Daily News.</font>

185
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:20,314
<font color="yellow">Anyway, he's going to tell his family about it.</font>

186
00:15:20,974 --> 00:15:24,614
<font color="yellow">This is the copy of padded account for Kim Geum Ja's academy.</font>

187
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:27,174
<font color="yellow">This suits well...</font>

188
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:29,714
<font color="yellow">to close down the academy.</font>

189
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,044
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your hard work.</font>

190
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:38,374
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good time with Ms. Han at the theater?</font>

191
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:44,244
<font color="yellow">- Yes, I did. - I hope you had fun.</font>

192
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:46,574
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by it?</font>

193
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,244
<font color="yellow">I mean you should enjoy it...</font>

194
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:51,144
<font color="yellow">and you should also be careful.</font>

195
00:15:52,044 --> 00:15:55,414
<font color="yellow">People will open up when you give what they want...</font>

196
00:15:55,974 --> 00:15:57,744
<font color="yellow">just like you gave the honor and power...</font>

197
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,374
<font color="yellow">to Han Seong Sik who sought for them.</font>

198
00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:06,514
<font color="yellow">What did she want from you?</font>

199
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:10,774
<font color="yellow">Do you plan on...</font>

200
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,544
<font color="yellow">including her on the list?</font>

201
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:17,014
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

202
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:18,844
<font color="yellow">Then, please be careful.</font>

203
00:16:19,474 --> 00:16:22,944
<font color="yellow">Give what she wants, but don't get swayed.</font>

204
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:29,714
<font color="yellow">I'm only telling you this because you are still young.</font>

205
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:54,844
<font color="yellow">I took off my cast.</font>

206
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:01,514
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

207
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:04,774
<font color="yellow">Why are you incompetent?</font>

208
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:08,684
<font color="yellow">And why is our family so insignificant?</font>

209
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:10,684
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me...</font>

210
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:14,944
<font color="yellow">someone from a family with no money or connections?</font>

211
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,184
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

212
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:19,074
<font color="yellow">make me someone who is from an insignificant family?</font>

213
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:23,644
<font color="yellow">Why are you so unsuccessful that you can't even back me up?</font>

214
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:30,074
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

215
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:36,144
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

216
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:39,044
<font color="yellow">- Get out. - Mom.</font>

217
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,414
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

218
00:17:40,444 --> 00:17:43,714
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to see you. Get out. - Mom.</font>

219
00:17:43,714 --> 00:17:46,914
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm really sorry. I deserve to die.</font>

220
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,644
<font color="yellow">- I don't need a son like you. - Mom.</font>

221
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:51,414
<font color="yellow">- Get out. - Mom.</font>

222
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,544
<font color="yellow">I had...</font>

223
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,474
<font color="yellow">my reasons.</font>

224
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,644
<font color="yellow">Please hear me out.</font>

225
00:17:58,874 --> 00:18:00,874
<font color="yellow">Reasons? What kind of reasons do you have?</font>

226
00:18:00,874 --> 00:18:03,844
<font color="yellow">Even if you did, how could you say those words to your parents?</font>

227
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:06,774
<font color="yellow">You asked why we raised you the way we did?</font>

228
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:08,444
<font color="yellow">- You little punk. - Mom.</font>

229
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,644
<font color="yellow">Somehow, I...</font>

230
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,874
<font color="yellow">got laid off from the program.</font>

231
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:17,544
<font color="yellow">I felt like destroying myself.</font>

232
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,074
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

233
00:18:19,714 --> 00:18:22,184
<font color="yellow">Why were you laid off?</font>

234
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:26,544
<font color="yellow">I told you. I got laid off because I didn't have connections.</font>

235
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:29,944
<font color="yellow">That isn't an excuse. How could you take it out on us?</font>

236
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,974
<font color="yellow">I didn't take it out on you, Mom.</font>

237
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,914
<font color="yellow">I was just stressed out.</font>

238
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:38,314
<font color="yellow">I just remembered how you played favorites with Seong Hoon.</font>

239
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:39,874
<font color="yellow">I was drunk.</font>

240
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,344
<font color="yellow">That's why...</font>

241
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,144
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

242
00:18:48,184 --> 00:18:49,214
<font color="yellow">Isn't this nice?</font>

243
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:54,774
<font color="yellow">I bought this because I thought this would look good on you.</font>

244
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:57,514
<font color="yellow">Don't buy me this sort of thing.</font>

245
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:59,614
<font color="yellow">Don't disappoint us.</font>

246
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:04,374
<font color="yellow">I've been holding grudges against you.</font>

247
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,844
<font color="yellow">Be honest. Dad and you did...</font>

248
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:10,074
<font color="yellow">discriminate me with Seong Hoon.</font>

249
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:12,714
<font color="yellow">You babied him even if he did badly because he was the oldest.</font>

250
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:16,314
<font color="yellow">You didn't compliment me when I did well because I was the youngest.</font>

251
00:19:16,374 --> 00:19:19,414
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. When did we do that? - You did.</font>

252
00:19:19,544 --> 00:19:22,244
<font color="yellow">To be frank, when we grew up together,</font>

253
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:25,444
<font color="yellow">which one of us disappointed you more? Did he disappoint you more?</font>

254
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,974
<font color="yellow">Or did I disappoint you more?</font>

255
00:19:27,974 --> 00:19:29,974
<font color="yellow">He disappointed you more than I did.</font>

256
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:32,074
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? Until now,</font>

257
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:35,374
<font color="yellow">he never disappointed us. He was the perfect oldest son.</font>

258
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,814
<font color="yellow">The perfect oldest son?</font>

259
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:38,474
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

260
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,314
<font color="yellow">Don't you really remember?</font>

261
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:55,874
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

262
00:19:57,144 --> 00:19:59,774
<font color="yellow">I want to drop out of school and play rock.</font>

263
00:20:00,844 --> 00:20:01,844
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

264
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:04,214
<font color="yellow">What? Play what?</font>

265
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:05,544
<font color="yellow">I want to play rock.</font>

266
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:07,814
<font color="yellow">Spirit of rock.</font>

267
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:11,014
<font color="yellow">I want to express the symbol and resistance...</font>

268
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:15,544
<font color="yellow">of youth in present time through rock.</font>

269
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:16,574
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

270
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:21,474
<font color="yellow">Mom. Mom!</font>

271
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,014
<font color="yellow">Mom! Get up.</font>

272
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:25,874
<font color="yellow">Get a hold of yourself.</font>

273
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,974
<font color="yellow">Mom. Seong Hoon. Mom!</font>

274
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:37,214
<font color="yellow">Father, what are we going to do with Seong Hoon?</font>

275
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:40,374
<font color="yellow">That's exactly my point.</font>

276
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:45,774
<font color="yellow">Please go back.</font>

277
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:50,344
<font color="yellow">I've already left the secular world.</font>

278
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:54,514
<font color="yellow">I will cut my ties to my family.</font>

279
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:57,714
<font color="yellow">I would like to enter the stage of nirvana...</font>

280
00:20:58,044 --> 00:21:01,684
<font color="yellow">in order to find deeper happiness.</font>

281
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:03,684
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:05,274
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

283
00:21:05,644 --> 00:21:08,914
<font color="yellow">Who told you to become a monk? You were to study for journalism exam.</font>

284
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:12,244
<font color="yellow">You're doing this because you don't want to study.</font>

285
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,744
<font color="yellow">Do you know what enlightenment is?</font>

286
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:21,274
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

287
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,614
<font color="yellow">- Seong Hoon. - Seong Hoon! Seong Hoon!</font>

288
00:21:28,684 --> 00:21:30,814
<font color="yellow">Don't do this.</font>

289
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:34,014
<font color="yellow">Let's go down and have spareribs.</font>

290
00:21:42,444 --> 00:21:47,414
<font color="yellow">I can't approve of this marriage. I won't give you my blessing.</font>

291

294
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,944
<font color="yellow">I will choose her...</font>

295
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:00,674
<font color="yellow">over you.</font>

296
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,474
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

297
00:22:06,244 --> 00:22:08,744
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, don't say that.</font>

298
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:15,214
<font color="yellow">Why do you like her?</font>

299

309
00:22:50,914 --> 00:22:54,174
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, you forgot because you've gotten old.</font>

310
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,344
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon troubled you a lot.</font>

311
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:00,114
<font color="yellow">But your brother didn't get drunk...</font>

312
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,444
<font color="yellow">and took it out on us.</font>

313
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:03,574
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

314
00:23:04,714 --> 00:23:06,744
<font color="yellow">Mom. Don't be like this.</font>

315
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:09,644
<font color="yellow">I think I should get an office for my practice.</font>

316
00:23:10,114 --> 00:23:14,074
<font color="yellow">Can't you lend me a little bit of money like you did for Seong Hoon?</font>

317
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,144
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

318
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:17,574
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

319
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:19,574
<font color="yellow">I should start my law practice again.</font>

320
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:21,074
<font color="yellow">Which brings me to my next question...</font>

321
00:23:21,214 --> 00:23:23,674
<font color="yellow">- I can't believe this. Hey! - Mom.</font>

322
00:23:28,144 --> 00:23:29,374
<font color="yellow">You, come outside with me.</font>

323
00:23:29,914 --> 00:23:31,944
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

324
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:32,974
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

325
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,574
<font color="yellow">- You come here. - Seong Hoon, hold on.</font>

326
00:23:35,844 --> 00:23:37,614
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Today, I will...</font>

327
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:40,144
<font color="yellow">- Come inside. - Seong Hoon, let go of me.</font>

328
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:42,414
<font color="yellow">- Let me go. - Come inside, you little punk.</font>

329
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:43,414
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

330
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,944
<font color="yellow">How could you behave so rudely after you've been drinking?</font>

331
00:23:49,114 --> 00:23:52,014
<font color="yellow">Do you know how sad they were because of you?</font>

332
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:53,374
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

333
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:56,844
<font color="yellow">That's why I bought a present for Mom.</font>

334
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:59,644
<font color="yellow">Do you think that can smooth things over after what you've done?</font>

335
00:24:00,114 --> 00:24:02,544
<font color="yellow">Do you think you can be forgiven with that?</font>

336
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:04,644
<font color="yellow">As I told Mom before,</font>

337
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:08,274
<font color="yellow">you're the one who troubled our parents the most.</font>

338
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:11,774
<font color="yellow">I vent a bit because I got laid off from the TV station.</font>

339
00:24:12,114 --> 00:24:15,014
<font color="yellow">To be blunt, when you are struggling,</font>

340
00:24:15,014 --> 00:24:18,674
<font color="yellow">haven't you wished that our parents were well connected?</font>

341
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:19,844
<font color="yellow">Well, I have.</font>

342
00:24:20,114 --> 00:24:21,674
<font color="yellow">What I'm saying is It's hard...</font>

343
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:25,144
<font color="yellow">to succeed on your own even if you are talented in Korea.</font>

344
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:28,614
<font color="yellow">I'm saying a great man can't rise from a humble family now.</font>

345
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:29,844
<font color="yellow">So you're saying...</font>

346
00:24:30,574 --> 00:24:33,074
<font color="yellow">our dad who has been living to raise us...</font>

347
00:24:33,614 --> 00:24:35,614
<font color="yellow">- for all his life is nothing? - I mean.</font>

348
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:37,874
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

349
00:24:38,244 --> 00:24:40,274
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean that.</font>

350
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:42,714
<font color="yellow">What an ungrateful child.</font>

351
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,174
<font color="yellow">How can you...</font>

352
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:48,074
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You're sly like a snake.</font>

353
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:49,374
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Hold on.</font>

354
00:24:49,374 --> 00:24:52,274
<font color="yellow">I'm going to teach you a lesson today.</font>

355
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:55,774
<font color="yellow">Wait. Isn't anyone home?</font>

356
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,774
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. Your father's about to die.</font>

357
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,344
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon! How dare you!</font>

358
00:25:02,674 --> 00:25:03,714
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

359
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:06,144
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die.</font>

360
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:10,074
<font color="yellow">The poor second son who received nothing...</font>

361
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:12,614
<font color="yellow">from his parents is dying!</font>

362
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,114
<font color="yellow">We are back.</font>

363
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,674
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Honey!</font>

364
00:25:17,744 --> 00:25:19,114
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

365
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:22,714
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, what's going on?</font>

366
00:25:23,144 --> 00:25:25,214
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Chang Soo,</font>

367
00:25:25,344 --> 00:25:28,514
<font color="yellow">I'm your dad. Come help me.</font>

368
00:25:28,644 --> 00:25:29,814
<font color="yellow">Let go of me.</font>

369
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:33,614
<font color="yellow">Honey, what on earth is this?</font>

370
00:25:34,544 --> 00:25:35,914
<font color="yellow">Can't you see it?</font>

371
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,344
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon is beating me up.</font>

372
00:25:40,114 --> 00:25:43,044
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Mom.</font>

373
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,214
<font color="yellow">Ah In, it's okay.</font>

374
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:47,974
<font color="yellow">You little jerk.</font>

375
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:51,914
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, how can you do this to him?</font>

376
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:56,014
<font color="yellow">You can't use violence in front of the children...</font>

377
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:58,444
<font color="yellow">even though he's younger than you.</font>

378
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:01,874
<font color="yellow">This is really barbaric.</font>

379
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:04,844
<font color="yellow">- Do you want them to learn this? - Hey.</font>

380
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:09,944
<font color="yellow">You can't talk down to Seong Hoon in front of the kids, either.</font>

381
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,974
<font color="yellow">- What? - Hey,</font>

382
00:26:12,644 --> 00:26:16,514
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik deserves a good beating, of course.</font>

383
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:17,914
<font color="yellow">Why would Chang Soo...</font>

384
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:21,514
<font color="yellow">Why would Ji Hoon's dad hit him, then?</font>

385
00:26:21,614 --> 00:26:23,214
<font color="yellow">- Hye Joo! - Enough!</font>

386
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:26,674
<font color="yellow">Let's stop. The kids are here.</font>

387
00:26:27,014 --> 00:26:29,644
<font color="yellow">You'd be as good as dead if it weren't the kids.</font>

388
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:33,474
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're really something else.</font>

389
00:26:33,714 --> 00:26:36,214
<font color="yellow">- Get you! - Say that again.</font>

390
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:39,644
<font color="yellow">Don't say anything!</font>

391
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:41,244
<font color="yellow">Why do you provoke him?</font>

392
00:26:41,514 --> 00:26:44,274
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, please let go of him.</font>

393
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,344
<font color="yellow">The kids are watching you.</font>

394
00:26:46,614 --> 00:26:48,674
<font color="yellow">- Wait. - Please calm down.</font>

395
00:26:48,714 --> 00:26:50,244
<font color="yellow">Let him go, Honey.</font>

396
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:54,144
<font color="yellow">Living in the same house with this jerk...</font>

397
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,244
<font color="yellow">is so stressful.</font>

398
00:26:57,514 --> 00:27:00,074
<font color="yellow">I am also very...</font>

399
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,774
<font color="yellow">stressed out.</font>

400
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:03,714
<font color="yellow">Honey, stop it.</font>

401
00:27:03,714 --> 00:27:06,774
<font color="yellow">- Let him go. - Goodness.</font>

402
00:27:06,814 --> 00:27:09,414
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, please let him go.</font>

403
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:12,074
<font color="yellow">I love you, Hye Joo.</font>

404
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:18,974
<font color="yellow">Gosh, get off from him.</font>

405
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:20,744
<font color="yellow">Honey, stop!</font>

406
00:27:20,744 --> 00:27:21,874
<font color="yellow">You little jerk.</font>

407
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:23,714
<font color="yellow">Stop it.</font>

408
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:26,614
<font color="yellow">Hey, don't just stand there. Come pull your dad.</font>

409
00:27:28,344 --> 00:27:30,744
<font color="yellow">Please let him go, Seong Hoon.</font>

410
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:33,674
<font color="yellow">How dare you?</font>

411
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:35,214
<font color="yellow">He's trying to kill me.</font>

412
00:27:35,544 --> 00:27:36,644
<font color="yellow">Why are you just watching us?</font>

413
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,714
<font color="yellow">Please stop!</font>

414
00:27:46,514 --> 00:27:48,474
<font color="yellow">Please stop fighting.</font>

415
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:56,174
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

416
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:59,574
<font color="yellow">Honey, we won.</font>

417
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:01,614
<font color="yellow">We won!</font>

418
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,614
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, good job. Give me a high five.</font>

419
00:28:07,414 --> 00:28:10,014
<font color="yellow">- We won. Honey. - Okay.</font>

420
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:12,844
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how embarrassing.</font>

421
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:16,644
<font color="yellow">You should have controlled yourself.</font>

422
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:19,544
<font color="yellow">But he was too rude to Mom and Dad.</font>

423
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:22,674
<font color="yellow">You know he's always been that way,</font>

424
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:27,944
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Ji Hoon and Ah In,</font>

425
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,844
<font color="yellow">I apologize for making you watch such disgraceful sight.</font>

426
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,514
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

427
00:28:36,244 --> 00:28:38,914
<font color="yellow">Come here, Ah In.</font>

428
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:43,274
<font color="yellow">- I am sorry, Ji Hoon. - It's all right.</font>

429
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:45,744
<font color="yellow">I think adults also need to be honest...</font>

430
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:49,244
<font color="yellow">- with their own feelings. - Goodness.</font>

431
00:28:49,914 --> 00:28:51,074
<font color="yellow">Thank you for understanding me.</font>

432
00:28:51,374 --> 00:28:53,974
<font color="yellow">However, I don't think what you did...</font>

433
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:57,374
<font color="yellow">wasn't a right thing to do as an adult.</font>

434
00:29:01,274 --> 00:29:02,274
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

435
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,974
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that I was beaten by him at this age.</font>

436
00:29:13,244 --> 00:29:14,714
<font color="yellow">How humiliating.</font>

437
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:19,174
<font color="yellow">You know he's ill-tempered. You should have been quiet.</font>

438
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:22,144
<font color="yellow">- Why did you get on his nerves? - It's your fault.</font>

439
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:25,174
<font color="yellow">- Why is that so? - I was busy working at the show.</font>

440
00:29:25,344 --> 00:29:27,474
<font color="yellow">You should have taken care of the family affairs.</font>

441
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,414
<font color="yellow">You've lost your mind since we found out about the kids.</font>

442
00:29:30,544 --> 00:29:33,074
<font color="yellow">So Seong Hoon ripped Mom and Dad off...</font>

443
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,744
<font color="yellow">and opened a restaurant with it.</font>

444
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:37,014
<font color="yellow">Oh, boy. Excuse me.</font>

445
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:41,144
<font color="yellow">My whole universe collapsed.</font>

446
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:44,074
<font color="yellow">- Would a restaurant be a big deal? - I don't care!</font>

447
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:48,044
<font color="yellow">We moved in to take care of Dad. Look what we ended up with.</font>

448
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:49,774
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon...</font>

449
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:54,114
<font color="yellow">took our money and son.</font>

450
00:29:55,014 --> 00:29:56,044
<font color="yellow">He even...</font>

451
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,114
<font color="yellow">beat me today.</font>

452
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:02,974
<font color="yellow">How pathetic.</font>

453
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,344
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

454
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:12,314
<font color="yellow">Please stay still.</font>

455
00:30:17,544 --> 00:30:18,614
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

456
00:30:18,674 --> 00:30:20,914
<font color="yellow">You still shouldn't have fought with him in front of the kids.</font>

457
00:30:21,274 --> 00:30:23,014
<font color="yellow">They learn from adults.</font>

458
00:30:23,944 --> 00:30:26,844
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry about me. I understand you.</font>

459
00:30:27,214 --> 00:30:28,874
<font color="yellow">What do you mean you understand me?</font>

460
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:32,774
<font color="yellow">Like Cain and Abel,</font>

461
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:35,644
<font color="yellow">brothers envy and compete against each other.</font>

462
00:30:37,974 --> 00:30:39,974
<font color="yellow">Once upon a time, there were Cain and Abel.</font>

463
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,474
<font color="yellow">Cain was a farmer and Abel was a herder.</font>

464
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:45,014
<font color="yellow">One day, Cain got really angry...</font>

465
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,874
<font color="yellow">and killed his brother Abel.</font>

466
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:51,474
<font color="yellow">What? He killed his brother?</font>

467
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:52,644
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

468
00:30:53,414 --> 00:30:54,414
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

469
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:56,514
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

470
00:30:57,844 --> 00:31:01,374
<font color="yellow">How did he become so smart all of a sudden?</font>

471
00:31:02,714 --> 00:31:05,114
<font color="yellow">He studies hard these days. Chang Soo.</font>

472
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:07,744
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Get up. You should study.</font>

473
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,144
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

474
00:31:10,444 --> 00:31:12,774
<font color="yellow">Calm down and stay here.</font>

475
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:14,914
<font color="yellow">- Let's go, Chang Soo! - Okay!</font>

476
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:17,514
<font color="yellow">Honey. Honey.</font>

477
00:31:22,944 --> 00:31:24,014
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

478
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:28,374
<font color="yellow">He wants to open his own office?</font>

479
00:31:28,744 --> 00:31:29,914
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

480
00:31:30,144 --> 00:31:33,344
<font color="yellow">That's what he said. He asked to give him some money for that.</font>

481
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,944
<font color="yellow">So what did you tell him?</font>

482
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:38,514
<font color="yellow">Of course, I flatly rejected. I said we have no money left.</font>

483
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:39,944
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

484
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:46,114
<font color="yellow">Our children are no different from enemies.</font>

485
00:31:46,744 --> 00:31:48,514
<font color="yellow">Thinking about it,</font>

486
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,214
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

487
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:54,474
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik is totally wrong.</font>

488
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,674
<font color="yellow">- What? - To be honest,</font>

489
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:01,514
<font color="yellow">we were busy taking care of Seong Hoon and Seong Joon.</font>

490
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:06,774
<font color="yellow">So we couldn't fully support him.</font>

491
00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:08,274
<font color="yellow">Please stop that rubbish.</font>

492
00:32:08,314 --> 00:32:11,444
<font color="yellow">Is that a conclusion you drew after a day at the mountain?</font>

493
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:14,644
<font color="yellow">You know how much he wants to stand out.</font>

494
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:17,714
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he was discouraged by his colleagues from wealthy families.</font>

495
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:21,844
<font color="yellow">I knew you'd think this way.</font>

496
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,144
<font color="yellow">Frankly speaking,</font>

497
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:26,544
<font color="yellow">he has no reason to be discouraged.</font>

498
00:32:26,974 --> 00:32:29,744
<font color="yellow">Some kids don't even have parents.</font>

499
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,944
<font color="yellow">He had parents who fed him with food, clothes,</font>

500
00:32:33,014 --> 00:32:34,714
<font color="yellow">and a place to live in and study.</font>

501
00:32:34,774 --> 00:32:37,444
<font color="yellow">We sent him college and helped him when he got married.</font>

502
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:40,544
<font color="yellow">How can he blame us for not being rich?</font>

503
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:43,474
<font color="yellow">Do you really think we deserve that?</font>

504
00:32:43,474 --> 00:32:45,914
<font color="yellow">He said that...</font>

505
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:49,174
<font color="yellow">because his life isn't easy. Don't take it literally.</font>

506
00:32:49,314 --> 00:32:51,814
<font color="yellow">What about you? Why do you climb the mountain...</font>

507
00:32:51,814 --> 00:32:54,514
<font color="yellow">almost every day, then? You even have a blister on your lips.</font>

508
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:57,744
<font color="yellow">You're also very disappointed at Seong Sik,</font>

509
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,514
<font color="yellow">aren't you?</font>

510
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:02,074
<font color="yellow">This blister has nothing to do with Seong Sik.</font>

511
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:05,214
<font color="yellow">I got it because the weather is too cold.</font>

512
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:10,214
<font color="yellow">By the way, how will he open...</font>

513
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:11,914
<font color="yellow">his office?</font>

514
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:15,714
<font color="yellow">- Don't we have to help him? - Honey!</font>

515
00:33:17,114 --> 00:33:19,244
<font color="yellow">You scared me. Why do you yell at me?</font>

516
00:33:19,544 --> 00:33:22,214
<font color="yellow">He received the deposit for rent.</font>

517
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:25,814
<font color="yellow">He can open the office with that. We're not his piggy bank.</font>

518
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,774
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

519
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,314
<font color="yellow">Please stop it.</font>

520
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:33,574
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Housing Finance Corporation.</font>

521

<font color="yellow">told me about it this morning.</font>

524
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,614
<font color="yellow">They have a pension plan.</font>

525
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:49,774
<font color="yellow">If we rent the second floor,</font>

526
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:53,644
<font color="yellow">they will pay us pension every month.</font>

527
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:55,474
<font color="yellow">As Seong Hoon...</font>

528
00:33:55,974 --> 00:33:59,144
<font color="yellow">doesn't seem to be able to pay rent to us.</font>

529
00:33:59,414 --> 00:34:01,844
<font color="yellow">He will also not going to move out easily.</font>

530
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:05,244
<font color="yellow">So let's go and ask them if we can get this pension.</font>

531
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,814
<font color="yellow">That's absurd.</font>

532
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:09,944
<font color="yellow">Why is it absurd?</font>

533
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:13,274

535
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:19,814
<font color="yellow">Did he say he'll get married?</font>

542
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:53,214
<font color="yellow">You're such a greedy girl.</font>

543

<font color="yellow">They won't pay you that much.</font>

544

<font color="yellow">You told me to pick someone ordinary and smart.</font>

618
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:52,444
<font color="yellow">I told you to pick one, not date one.</font>

619
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:53,614
<font color="yellow">Here you go again.</font>

620
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:55,444
<font color="yellow">It's not something you can control.</font>

621
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:58,344
<font color="yellow">You can't control your feelings.</font>

622
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:00,544
<font color="yellow">You can. That's what a business owner does.</font>

623
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,214
<font color="yellow">Have you forgotten that thousands of lives depend on your hands?</font>

624
00:39:04,444 --> 00:39:06,244
<font color="yellow">You'll soon run a company.</font>

625
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:10,084
<font color="yellow">And yet, you're lying in bed refusing to eat because of a guy.</font>

626
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,174
<font color="yellow">This is important to me.</font>

627
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:13,714
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

628
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:17,514
<font color="yellow">I just didn't want to give away my daughter and company to some guy.</font>

629
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,414
<font color="yellow">I was going to let you marry a smart and ordinary guy,</font>

630
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,714
<font color="yellow">and make him the chairman so I can control him from behind.</font>

631
00:39:23,814 --> 00:39:26,514
<font color="yellow">That's the only reason why I approved your relationship.</font>

632
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:30,544
<font color="yellow">It's not because I like him that I let you see him.</font>

633
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:34,444
<font color="yellow">Dad. Is that what you told Seong Joon?</font>

634
00:39:34,844 --> 00:39:36,914
<font color="yellow">Do you think he didn't know?</font>

635
00:39:37,444 --> 00:39:39,774
<font color="yellow">It all comes down to a decision in the end.</font>

636
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,084
<font color="yellow">He can either be my son-in-law and bear the disgrace,</font>

637
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:44,914
<font color="yellow">or he can keep his petty pride...</font>

638
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:46,544
<font color="yellow">and stay in the lower class.</font>

639
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:47,814
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

640
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:52,514
<font color="yellow">If that was your plan, why didn't you just let me run the company?</font>

641
00:39:53,214 --> 00:39:55,944
<font color="yellow">Grandma is a woman, but she ran the company by herself.</font>

642
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,274
<font color="yellow">Don't talk about your grandmother.</font>

643
00:39:58,614 --> 00:40:01,014
<font color="yellow">She's too weak and compassionate.</font>

644
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:03,474
<font color="yellow">If it wasn't for me, our company...</font>

645
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:06,044
<font color="yellow">would've been broken apart long ago.</font>

646
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:09,514
<font color="yellow">Your own daughter is about to be broken apart.</font>

647
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,114
<font color="yellow">If you keep doing this,</font>

648
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,414
<font color="yellow">I'll kill myself.</font>

649
00:40:15,474 --> 00:40:16,544
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

650
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,174
<font color="yellow">(Letter of Resignation)</font>

651
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:41,544
<font color="yellow">(Letter of Resignation)</font>

652
00:40:57,644 --> 00:41:00,544
<font color="yellow">The more I think about it, the more I get upset.</font>

653
00:41:01,514 --> 00:41:03,414
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

654
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,274
<font color="yellow">He's your son. It's not like you can kill him or anything.</font>

655
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:08,644
<font color="yellow">Mother. Hyung Seop says...</font>

656
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:11,214
<font color="yellow">he can understand Seong Sik.</font>

657
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:14,474
<font color="yellow">He says Seong Sik is a poor kid who gave up things for his brothers.</font>

658
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:15,844
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

659
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,514
<font color="yellow">Look. There is no one in this world...</font>

660
00:41:18,514 --> 00:41:20,914
<font color="yellow">whom Hyung Seop can't understand.</font>

661
00:41:21,014 --> 00:41:24,514
<font color="yellow">He should be scolding and yelling at Seong Sik.</font>

662
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:25,914
<font color="yellow">How could he say he understands?</font>

663
00:41:26,714 --> 00:41:28,214
<font color="yellow">I just can't believe it.</font>

664
00:41:29,114 --> 00:41:31,644
<font color="yellow">As a father, he should be stricter.</font>

665
00:41:31,644 --> 00:41:33,514
<font color="yellow">He's just too soft.</font>

666
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,274
<font color="yellow">When he gets older,</font>

667
00:41:35,274 --> 00:41:37,814
<font color="yellow">our children will all look down on him.</font>

668
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:40,344
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. You have Seong Joon.</font>

669
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:44,114
<font color="yellow">He will believe anything Hyung Seop says.</font>

670
00:41:44,114 --> 00:41:47,814
<font color="yellow">You only need one child who understands how you feel.</font>

671
00:41:48,014 --> 00:41:50,214
<font color="yellow">Don't expect all of them to understand you.</font>

672
00:41:50,874 --> 00:41:52,144
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

673
00:41:52,674 --> 00:41:54,944
<font color="yellow">what are we going to do with Seong Joon?</font>

674
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:56,044
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

675
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:59,084
<font color="yellow">What if he marries that girl named Mi Joo?</font>

676
00:41:59,274 --> 00:42:02,444
<font color="yellow">She's the only daughter of the chairman.</font>

677
00:42:02,444 --> 00:42:04,914
<font color="yellow">It should be different from how Seong Hoon...</font>

678
00:42:04,914 --> 00:42:06,914
<font color="yellow">and Seong Sik got married.</font>

679
00:42:06,974 --> 00:42:08,744
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're right.</font>

680
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:11,474
<font color="yellow">I guess we shouldn't be too happy that...</font>

681
00:42:11,474 --> 00:42:13,474
<font color="yellow">she's the chairman's beautiful daughter.</font>

682
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:15,174
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

683
00:42:19,344 --> 00:42:21,744
<font color="yellow">By the way, Mother.</font>

684
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,714
<font color="yellow">When Seong Joon gets married,</font>

685
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:27,874
<font color="yellow">his mother...</font>

686
00:42:28,374 --> 00:42:30,374
<font color="yellow">- will come, right? - What?</font>

687
00:42:32,144 --> 00:42:34,544
<font color="yellow">I've been holding it in...</font>

688
00:42:35,114 --> 00:42:37,474
<font color="yellow">for more than 20 years,</font>

689
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:40,814
<font color="yellow">but I'm going to see her face...</font>

690
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:43,774
<font color="yellow">when Seong Joon gets married.</font>

691
00:42:43,944 --> 00:42:45,314
<font color="yellow">Why would you do that?</font>

692
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:49,674
<font color="yellow">You've raised him for over 20 years. He's your son, not anybody else's.</font>

693
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:54,374
<font color="yellow">You're a woman, too. I'm sure you understand how I feel.</font>

694
00:42:54,374 --> 00:42:57,844
<font color="yellow">Of course I do. I understand how you must feel.</font>

695
00:42:58,014 --> 00:43:00,314
<font color="yellow">I don't know if anyone would, but I do understand.</font>

696
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:03,474
<font color="yellow">You've treated all of your four children alike.</font>

697
00:43:03,844 --> 00:43:07,114
<font color="yellow">I know you must have wanted to hate him and be mean to him,</font>

698
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:10,614
<font color="yellow">but you have been trying so hard not to.</font>

699
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:15,084
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae. That's why I've been always grateful to you.</font>

700
00:43:15,444 --> 00:43:18,744
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to see her face after all this time?</font>

701
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:20,514
<font color="yellow">Why would you want to dig up the past?</font>

702
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:23,774
<font color="yellow">I just want to know...</font>

703
00:43:24,214 --> 00:43:25,544
<font color="yellow">what kind of person she is.</font>

704
00:43:26,444 --> 00:43:29,344
<font color="yellow">She abandoned her child,</font>

705
00:43:29,584 --> 00:43:31,214
<font color="yellow">and never contacted us.</font>

706
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:33,874
<font color="yellow">I know. I want to see her, too.</font>

707
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:36,944
<font color="yellow">You know Hyung Seop isn't someone who would cheat on his wife,</font>

708
00:43:36,974 --> 00:43:40,014
<font color="yellow">but he cheated on you with that woman.</font>

709
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:41,544
<font color="yellow">I want to see her, too.</font>

710
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:45,014
<font color="yellow">But Jeong Ae. You should keep this to yourself.</font>

711
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:48,574
<font color="yellow">If you dig it up, it will only hurt your feelings.</font>

712
00:43:51,614 --> 00:43:52,844
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

713
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:56,074
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I'm having...</font>

714
00:43:56,674 --> 00:43:59,514
<font color="yellow">such a hard time because of my kids these days.</font>

715
00:43:59,874 --> 00:44:01,874
<font color="yellow">I know. My goodness.</font>

716
00:44:02,174 --> 00:44:03,914
<font color="yellow">It's never peaceful in our house.</font>

717
00:44:22,244 --> 00:44:23,374
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

718
00:44:26,114 --> 00:44:27,174
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

719
00:44:27,714 --> 00:44:29,144
<font color="yellow">Are you coming home from work?</font>

720
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:30,874
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

721
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:36,314
<font color="yellow">You got off work quite late.</font>

722
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:37,974
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

723
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:39,844
<font color="yellow">I was busy at work today.</font>

724
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:43,444
<font color="yellow">What line of work are you in?</font>

725
00:44:48,014 --> 00:44:49,114
<font color="yellow">Was that rude?</font>

726
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:50,714
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

727
00:44:51,014 --> 00:44:53,544
<font color="yellow">I'm working at contents marketing team.</font>

728
00:44:55,144 --> 00:44:56,274
<font color="yellow">That sounds like a fancy job.</font>

729
00:44:57,674 --> 00:45:00,374
<font color="yellow">It may sound like it, but that's not really true.</font>

730
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:04,514
<font color="yellow">But your father is so proud of you.</font>

731
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:09,214
<font color="yellow">My father is proud of all of his kids.</font>

732
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:14,274
<font color="yellow">But he seemed to have even more affection toward you.</font>

733
00:45:15,044 --> 00:45:16,474
<font color="yellow">It's because I'm the youngest.</font>

734
00:45:17,374 --> 00:45:19,274
<font color="yellow">Parents love their youngest kid the most.</font>

735
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:28,874
<font color="yellow">- Your name is Seong Joon, right? - Right.</font>

736
00:45:30,614 --> 00:45:32,574
<font color="yellow">You're very different from your brothers.</font>

737
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:34,544
<font color="yellow">You have a different personality.</font>

738
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:37,144
<font color="yellow">You are very good looking as well.</font>

739
00:45:38,314 --> 00:45:39,914
<font color="yellow">No, that's not true.</font>

740
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,114
<font color="yellow">My brothers are better than me.</font>

741
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,974
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

742
00:45:45,414 --> 00:45:48,274
<font color="yellow">Thank you for taking Seong Sik home...</font>

743
00:45:48,544 --> 00:45:49,874
<font color="yellow">the other day.</font>

744
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:53,044
<font color="yellow">I should have thanked you earlier.</font>

745
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:57,644
<font color="yellow">You're welcome. I just ran into him that day.</font>

746
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,274
<font color="yellow">Usually, he's not like that at all.</font>

747
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:04,944
<font color="yellow">I think he had some problem that day.</font>

748
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:09,074
<font color="yellow">I understand. Don't worry.</font>

749
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:12,514
<font color="yellow">Anyway, Seong Joon and my family...</font>

750
00:46:12,714 --> 00:46:15,074
<font color="yellow">owe you a lot.</font>

751
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:18,514
<font color="yellow">Please let me treat you to a good meal someday.</font>

752
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:23,944
<font color="yellow">Do you like drinking?</font>

753
00:46:24,244 --> 00:46:26,874
<font color="yellow">Yes, as much as others do.</font>

754
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:30,774
<font color="yellow">Then, let's have drinks later.</font>

755
00:46:31,514 --> 00:46:32,674
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

756
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,814
<font color="yellow">Good night, then.</font>

757
00:46:37,014 --> 00:46:38,414
<font color="yellow">It was nice to meet you.</font>

758
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:43,074
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

759
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,544
<font color="yellow">By the way, Jeong Eun is...</font>

760
00:46:53,074 --> 00:46:54,914
<font color="yellow">a soft touch.</font>

761
00:46:55,744 --> 00:46:56,844
<font color="yellow">Please be nice to her.</font>

762
00:47:10,874 --> 00:47:13,274
<font color="yellow">I was fired right away and didn't get any pay.</font>

763
00:47:13,514 --> 00:47:15,574
<font color="yellow">I should have written the scenario instead.</font>

764
00:47:16,844 --> 00:47:19,574
<font color="yellow">How can they steal my project proposal?</font>

765
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,674
<font color="yellow">I won't just sit back. Tomorrow...</font>

766
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:24,544
<font color="yellow">Should I write about it online?</font>

767
00:47:25,414 --> 00:47:27,474
<font color="yellow">Why don't you take some rest?</font>

768
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:29,944
<font color="yellow">Why are you standing and murmuring in the middle of the room?</font>

769
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:32,244
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing. - Did you have dinner?</font>

770
00:47:32,814 --> 00:47:34,174
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't and I won't.</font>

771
00:47:36,044 --> 00:47:37,074
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

772
00:47:37,974 --> 00:47:40,574
<font color="yellow">I'm busy. I will rather write the scenario.</font>

773
00:47:41,574 --> 00:47:45,474
<font color="yellow">Are you not studying with Seong Joon today?</font>

774
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,614
<font color="yellow">We don't study together every day.</font>

775
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,714
<font color="yellow">Writing isn't a team work.</font>

776
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:52,644
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

777
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:57,474
<font color="yellow">you work for the same company as Seong Joon, right?</font>

778
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,514
<font color="yellow">How did you know that?</font>

779
00:48:01,614 --> 00:48:04,814
<font color="yellow">Of course, Ms. Hwang told me.</font>

780
00:48:06,214 --> 00:48:10,014
<font color="yellow">I heard that he brought his fiance home the other day.</font>

781
00:48:11,744 --> 00:48:12,774
<font color="yellow">He did.</font>

782
00:48:12,874 --> 00:48:15,944
<font color="yellow">You should have told me about it earlier.</font>

783
00:48:15,944 --> 00:48:17,474
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you tell me?</font>

784
00:48:18,344 --> 00:48:21,714
<font color="yellow">He's your boss after all.</font>

785
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:25,114
<font color="yellow">I should thank him for helping you.</font>

786
00:48:25,144 --> 00:48:26,514
<font color="yellow">This isn't right.</font>

787
00:48:27,014 --> 00:48:30,514
<font color="yellow">I didn't tell you because I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.</font>

788
00:48:31,014 --> 00:48:34,014
<font color="yellow">Still, I should thank him, anyway.</font>

789
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:36,144
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

790
00:48:39,814 --> 00:48:40,814
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui,</font>

791
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:45,374
<font color="yellow">you can write more comfortably without me, right?</font>

792
00:48:45,574 --> 00:48:48,314
<font color="yellow">No, Grandma. You can stay here.</font>

793
00:48:48,474 --> 00:48:51,544
<font color="yellow">I'll just sleep downstairs.</font>

794
00:48:52,214 --> 00:48:55,944
<font color="yellow">Write as much as you want.</font>

795
00:48:56,844 --> 00:48:59,974
<font color="yellow">Why does she want me to sleep over these days?</font>

796
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:13,644
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

797
00:49:17,544 --> 00:49:18,574
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

798
00:49:19,674 --> 00:49:22,074
<font color="yellow">I was waiting for you.</font>

799
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:26,114
<font color="yellow">Will you make a scene again tonight?</font>

800
00:49:27,174 --> 00:49:28,344
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

801
00:49:29,374 --> 00:49:31,674
<font color="yellow">I heard about everything.</font>

802
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:39,814
<font color="yellow">I will thank you later. Have a good time.</font>

803
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:43,774
<font color="yellow">- See you tomorrow. - Good night.</font>

804
00:49:53,874 --> 00:49:56,744
<font color="yellow">What made you so scary that you want to sleep with me?</font>

805
00:49:56,914 --> 00:50:00,344
<font color="yellow">I think I'm too stressed because of my grandchildren.</font>

806
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,644
<font color="yellow">I fell asleep,</font>

807
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:05,644
<font color="yellow">and the grim reaper was...</font>

808
00:50:06,074 --> 00:50:08,944
<font color="yellow">sitting right there.</font>

809
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:11,044
<font color="yellow">It was really scary. Goodness.</font>

810
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:12,714
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

811
00:50:13,114 --> 00:50:16,444
<font color="yellow">you should have just followed him.</font>

812
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,574
<font color="yellow">Why did you send him away empty-handed?</font>

813
00:50:18,674 --> 00:50:20,774
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

814
00:50:20,774 --> 00:50:24,574
<font color="yellow">Are you saying I should have died last night?</font>

815
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:27,974
<font color="yellow">Let's not be petty.</font>

816
00:50:28,714 --> 00:50:32,044
<font color="yellow">We live with a lot of risks every day.</font>

817
00:50:32,314 --> 00:50:34,674
<font color="yellow">- The grim reaper is nothing. - What?</font>

818
00:50:35,344 --> 00:50:37,674
<font color="yellow">- What risks are you talking about? - Forget it.</font>

819
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:39,074
<font color="yellow">Let's go to bed.</font>

820
00:50:39,274 --> 00:50:42,974
<font color="yellow">Fine, I am petty. I want to live longer. Is that wrong?</font>

821
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:44,944
<font color="yellow">You're unbelievable.</font>

822
00:50:49,374 --> 00:50:51,874
<font color="yellow">You called me over for nothing.</font>

823
00:50:52,144 --> 00:50:53,514
<font color="yellow">You can't say it's nothing.</font>

824
00:50:53,974 --> 00:50:56,374
<font color="yellow">Aren't you afraid of death?</font>

825
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:01,744
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die than keep living like this.</font>

826
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:05,214
<font color="yellow">- What? - Look at me.</font>

827
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:09,214
<font color="yellow">I still have to work hard at this age.</font>

828
00:51:09,214 --> 00:51:10,544
<font color="yellow">I don't have my own house,</font>

829
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:14,174
<font color="yellow">so I'm living in my in-law's house with my granddaughter.</font>

830
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:17,814
<font color="yellow">It's such a harsh life, so I'd rather be dead.</font>

831
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,214
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

832
00:51:20,374 --> 00:51:22,244
<font color="yellow">I heard that Dong Hui is a writer.</font>

833
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:26,644
<font color="yellow">She does. Seong Joon is with her.</font>

834
00:51:27,444 --> 00:51:30,574
<font color="yellow">I think they'll have a discussion over night.</font>

835
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:32,944
<font color="yellow">Speaking of it,</font>

836
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:35,514
<font color="yellow">why don't you live on this floor?</font>

837
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:37,244
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

838
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,374
<font color="yellow">Writing requires a great deal of concentration...</font>

839
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:42,674
<font color="yellow">and sensitivity.</font>

840
00:51:42,774 --> 00:51:46,144
<font color="yellow">If you stay with her and snore while she writes,</font>

841
00:51:46,314 --> 00:51:49,944
<font color="yellow">she won't be able to come up with good stories.</font>

842
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,514
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

843
00:51:51,744 --> 00:51:53,974
<font color="yellow">Don't get mad and listen to me.</font>

844
00:51:53,974 --> 00:51:55,644
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui has to write the scenario,</font>

845
00:51:55,674 --> 00:51:59,314
<font color="yellow">and I am afraid of the grim reaper because I am petty.</font>

846
00:51:59,414 --> 00:52:01,274
<font color="yellow">So if you just live here with me,</font>

847
00:52:01,374 --> 00:52:05,274
<font color="yellow">it will be great for both Dong Hui and me, right?</font>

848
00:52:08,374 --> 00:52:11,144
<font color="yellow">("Fascinating Words")</font>

849
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,544
<font color="yellow">You're good at making ramyeon.</font>

850
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:19,644
<font color="yellow">- Is it good? - It is.</font>

851
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:23,444
<font color="yellow">I really wanted to read this book.</font>

852
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:25,174
<font color="yellow">I visited three libraries,</font>

853
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:26,874
<font color="yellow">but none of them had available one.</font>

854
00:52:32,314 --> 00:52:33,314
<font color="yellow">Were you okay...</font>

855
00:52:34,414 --> 00:52:35,874
<font color="yellow">when Mi Joo came here?</font>

856
00:52:37,874 --> 00:52:38,874
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

857
00:52:46,874 --> 00:52:48,544
<font color="yellow">I should be okay.</font>

858
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:52,874
<font color="yellow">I have no other choice.</font>

859
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:56,174
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

860
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:58,714
<font color="yellow">I understand.</font>

861
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:02,314
<font color="yellow">By the way, did something happen to you?</font>

862
00:53:02,674 --> 00:53:04,844
<font color="yellow">You look sad.</font>

863
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:08,644
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui,</font>

864
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:13,474
<font color="yellow">will you be okay...</font>

865
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:15,744
<font color="yellow">if I quit the company?</font>

866
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,944
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

867
00:53:18,974 --> 00:53:21,014
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

868
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:45,414
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

869
00:53:45,444 --> 00:53:47,944
<font color="yellow">You're my sunshine.</font>

870
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:50,614
<font color="yellow">My only sunshine.</font>

871
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:53,474
<font color="yellow">You make me happy.</font>

872
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:56,074
<font color="yellow">When skies are gray.</font>

873
00:53:56,214 --> 00:53:58,674
<font color="yellow">You'll never know dear.</font>

874
00:53:58,714 --> 00:54:01,274
<font color="yellow">How much I love you.</font>

875
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:05,774
<font color="yellow">Please don't take my sunshine away.</font>

876
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:08,644
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

877
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,314
<font color="yellow">Good morning, Hyun Woo.</font>

878
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:15,074
<font color="yellow">- This is what girlfriends do. - Girlfriend?</font>

879
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:18,544
<font color="yellow">I strangely couldn't sleep well,</font>

880
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:22,174
<font color="yellow">so I woke up early and opened the cafe.</font>

881
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:29,074
<font color="yellow">Do you know what time it is? It's five in the morning.</font>

882
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:34,214
<font color="yellow">Someone used to order sandwiches at three in the morning.</font>

883
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:38,974
<font color="yellow">You're up now. Come and have breakfast.</font>

884
00:54:39,044 --> 00:54:42,344
<font color="yellow">I'll prepare some hot milk and a cucumber sandwich.</font>

885
00:54:44,344 --> 00:54:45,374
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

886
00:54:46,514 --> 00:54:47,514
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

887
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:54,774
<font color="yellow">No, I won't take a shower</font>

888
00:54:55,544 --> 00:54:57,214
<font color="yellow">I won't wash my face.</font>

889
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:00,444
<font color="yellow">Why are you so late?</font>

890
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:02,644
<font color="yellow">I made your sandwich ages ago.</font>

891
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:04,744
<font color="yellow">I reheated the milk several times, too.</font>

892
00:55:05,544 --> 00:55:06,974
<font color="yellow">Hurry. Sit down.</font>

893
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:09,644
<font color="yellow">You have to eat and go to the construction site.</font>

894
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:11,514
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

895
00:55:15,014 --> 00:55:16,314
<font color="yellow">Eat your sandwich.</font>

896
00:55:21,014 --> 00:55:23,574
<font color="yellow">Welcome. Good morning.</font>

897
00:55:25,244 --> 00:55:26,414
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

898
00:55:26,974 --> 00:55:28,874
<font color="yellow">- I'd like sweet potato latte. - Sweet potato latte?</font>

899
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:31,374
<font color="yellow">Hold on please. Sweet potato latte.</font>

900
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:34,774
<font color="yellow">Here you go. Please wait.</font>

901
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:36,714
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

902
00:55:37,214 --> 00:55:38,244
<font color="yellow">Can I have the bubble tea?</font>

903
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:40,014
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thank you.</font>

904
00:55:40,014 --> 00:55:41,074
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

905
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:46,014
<font color="yellow">Please eat.</font>

906
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:58,614
<font color="yellow">My gosh. You ate the whole thing.</font>

907
00:55:59,944 --> 00:56:01,474
<font color="yellow">Good job.</font>

908
00:56:02,114 --> 00:56:03,544
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

909
00:56:04,714 --> 00:56:05,714
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

910
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:07,944
<font color="yellow">We decided to date each other.</font>

911
00:56:08,274 --> 00:56:10,114
<font color="yellow">This is what girlfriends do.</font>

912
00:56:10,474 --> 00:56:13,614
<font color="yellow">I read it in a book. This is how to earn affection from boyfriends.</font>

913
00:56:15,774 --> 00:56:17,444
<font color="yellow">You studied about that?</font>

914
00:56:18,514 --> 00:56:21,244
<font color="yellow">What can I do? I have no experience in dating.</font>

915
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:23,314
<font color="yellow">Please be understanding.</font>

916
00:56:24,544 --> 00:56:25,874
<font color="yellow">How cute.</font>

917
00:56:26,544 --> 00:56:27,644
<font color="yellow">Well done.</font>

918
00:56:28,444 --> 00:56:31,014
<font color="yellow">Don't go home tonight and wait for me here.</font>

919
00:56:32,844 --> 00:56:34,874
<font color="yellow">- What? - Bundle up.</font>

920
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:36,214
<font color="yellow">I will be here at 10pm.</font>

921
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:38,774
<font color="yellow">- Are we going somewhere? - Yes.</font>

922
00:56:38,874 --> 00:56:41,014
<font color="yellow">- Where? - Theater. To watch the movie again.</font>

923
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:42,674

01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:57,544
<font color="yellow">A guy named Mr. Lee came over.</font>

1079
01:06:58,844 --> 01:07:00,274
<font color="yellow">You like him, don't you?</font>

1080
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:05,174
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I knew it.</font>

1081
01:07:06,074 --> 01:07:07,644
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy.</font>

1082
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:09,514
<font color="yellow">How did you know?</font>

1083
01:07:09,944 --> 01:07:11,944
<font color="yellow">It's all written on your face.</font>

1084
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:15,944
<font color="yellow">Grandma and the rest of the family don't know.</font>

1085
01:07:16,044 --> 01:07:18,344
<font color="yellow">They're all blind fools who can't see anything.</font>

1086
01:07:22,014 --> 01:07:23,374
<font color="yellow">Listen to me carefully.</font>

1087
01:07:24,144 --> 01:07:26,174
<font color="yellow">- I can't let you see him. - What?</font>

1088
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:27,574
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

1089
01:07:51,774 --> 01:07:52,844
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - Gosh.</font>

1090
01:07:55,214 --> 01:07:57,244
<font color="yellow">- I'm going out on a date. - Pardon?</font>

1091
01:07:58,114 --> 01:08:00,214
<font color="yellow">You told me to give her what she wants.</font>

1092
01:08:20,114 --> 01:08:21,884
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1093
01:08:22,444 --> 01:08:24,544
<font color="yellow">So where is my brother, Sang Woo?</font>

1094
01:08:24,614 --> 01:08:27,614
<font color="yellow">He'd be around the same age as my cousin, Seong Joon.</font>

1095
01:08:28,074 --> 01:08:29,444
<font color="yellow">I've wished...</font>

1096
01:08:29,544 --> 01:08:32,314
<font color="yellow">you'd stay well and healthy all my life.</font>

1097

<font color="yellow">- Eat this. - My dear Ah In.</font>

1098
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:37,714
<font color="yellow">How would you feel if you have to live with me?</font>

1099
01:08:37,744 --> 01:08:39,444
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

1100
01:08:40,414 --> 01:08:41,544
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

1101
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:44,884
<font color="yellow">Are we going to sleep here together tonight?</font>

1102
01:08:44,974 --> 01:08:46,884
<font color="yellow">This is all for Seong Joon's sake.</font>

1103
01:08:47,114 --> 01:08:49,114
<font color="yellow">I'm just an office assistant. Even if I talk to him,</font>

1104
01:08:49,674 --> 01:08:51,144
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't make any difference.</font>
