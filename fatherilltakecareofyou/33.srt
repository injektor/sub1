1
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:10,705
<font color=#FFFF00>It said Hyung Seop drove your father to his death.</font>

2
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:16,975
<font color=#FFFF00>That can't be true.</font>

3
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:20,645
<font color=#FFFF00>- It can't be. My dad is... - Come to your senses.</font>

4
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad? Which one?</font>

5
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:26,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean your current dad who lived in an expensive house...</font>

6
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,475
<font color=#FFFF00>and acted superior because he worked at Seongsoo Trading Company?</font>

7
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:33,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Or do you mean your real dad who got beaten up...</font>

8
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:36,675
<font color=#FFFF00>and hung himself because he caused little injury...</font>

9
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,575
<font color=#FFFF00>to rich folk's children?</font>

10
00:00:39,745 --> 00:00:41,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Which one are you talking about?</font>

11
00:00:42,345 --> 00:00:43,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe it.</font>

12
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:46,175
<font color=#FFFF00>I just can't.</font>

13
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:50,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

14
00:00:51,645 --> 00:00:54,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess it's natural that you find it hard to believe. Why?</font>

15
00:00:55,975 --> 00:01:00,145
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because Hyung Seop has been such a wonderful father to you.</font>

16
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know that?</font>

17
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:06,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father only cares about his children.</font>

18
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:12,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Your sister Jeong Hwa was badly hurt, so he was furious.</font>

19
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,075
<font color=#FFFF00>He was an arrogant person who would do anything for his children.</font>

20
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:18,045
<font color=#FFFF00>After all that,</font>

21
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:20,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he think raising that man's son as his own...</font>

22
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,245
<font color=#FFFF00>was going to make up for what he's done?</font>

23
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:28,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I might not be a wealthy and noble person,</font>

24
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:32,975
<font color=#FFFF00>but I know others' children are also as precious as mine at least.</font>

25
00:01:45,845 --> 00:01:49,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you shouldn't talk on the phone when you're driving.</font>

26
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir,</font>

27
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,475
<font color=#FFFF00>I was talking with my wife...</font>

28
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:56,775
<font color=#FFFF00>because my kid got injured on his way to school this morning.</font>

29
00:01:56,775 --> 00:01:58,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang up already.</font>

30
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:02,645
<font color=#FFFF00>You're in charge of kids' safety. You can't use your phone.</font>

31
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:06,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, he cares a lot about the kids.</font>

32
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:08,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't worry.</font>

33
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,975
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I not be worried?</font>

34
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,375
<font color=#FFFF00>How would I know if he usually talks on the phone...</font>

35
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,275
<font color=#FFFF00>while he's driving or not?</font>

36
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't do that. I told you my kid got hurt.</font>

37
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:19,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, let me call you later.</font>

38
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Guys like you always cause car accidents...</font>

39
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:25,575
<font color=#FFFF00>and get kids injured. Do you know that?</font>

40
00:02:25,575 --> 00:02:28,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, can't you see that I hung up?</font>

41
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:31,005
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's enough. - How dare you!</font>

42
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandpa...</font>

43
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:37,575
<font color=#FFFF00>He explained that his kid got hurt. Please give him a break.</font>

44
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:40,905
<font color=#FFFF00>He even turned the engine off. Don't you think that's too much?</font>

45
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Min Seok, get in.</font>

46
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:45,345
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ah In, let's get in the car. - Forget it.</font>

47
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:49,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't send her to the kindergarten today. Just leave by yourselves.</font>

48
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:53,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll talk to the principal later.</font>

49
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,705
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to use your phone while you're driving,</font>

50
00:02:57,705 --> 00:03:00,375
<font color=#FFFF00>quit this job and find a new one. Okay?</font>

51
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:03,245
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you tell the principal about me?</font>

52
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir. Goodness.</font>

53
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously.</font>

54
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough is enough.</font>

55
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:24,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not the only one with grandchildren.</font>

56
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:29,305
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with that old woman?</font>

57
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandpa.</font>

58
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:34,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In.</font>

59
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:41,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In, let's have fun at home with me. Okay?</font>

60
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:43,545
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I hate you.</font>

61
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:47,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In.</font>

62
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,175
<font color=#FFFF00>It was for your safety.</font>

63
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:54,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Would the driver be fired today?</font>

64
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:57,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea.</font>

65
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:01,605
<font color=#FFFF00>If he gets fired, hire him.</font>

66
00:04:02,105 --> 00:04:03,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

67
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:05,605
<font color=#FFFF00>He hasn't changed at all.</font>

68
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:08,475
<font color=#FFFF00>He still cares about his children only.</font>

69
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:11,505
<font color=#FFFF00>You know people don't change easily.</font>

70
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:28,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Today, the executives of Golden Street will come...</font>

71
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,575
<font color=#FFFF00>to Korea to see you.</font>

72
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:33,175
<font color=#FFFF00>We could just have a video conference.</font>

73
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:35,775
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess they wanted to come...</font>

74
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,845
<font color=#FFFF00>and see how you're doing as your absence is prolonged.</font>

75
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. I heard that Seong Joon hasn't come to work...</font>

76
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,805
<font color=#FFFF00>since yesterday.</font>

77
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is that? Does he no longer want to work?</font>

78
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,175
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think so. It seems like he has some private problems.</font>

79
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,675
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't show up without notice.</font>

80
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:54,945
<font color=#FFFF00>That is why...</font>

81
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:59,275
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't come to my place to beg me to let his girlfriend...</font>

82
00:04:59,345 --> 00:05:00,775
<font color=#FFFF00>keep writing the scenario.</font>

83
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:03,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you plan to do with Jeong Hwa?</font>

84
00:05:07,745 --> 00:05:08,915
<font color=#FFFF00>As you can easily expect,</font>

85
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,415
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll have dinners...</font>

86
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,945
<font color=#FFFF00>and watch movies with her.</font>

87
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

88
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,205
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ah In, stop running. - Ah In.</font>

89
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you back home?</font>

90
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:29,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandpa told me not to go to the kindergarten.</font>

91
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:32,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you...</font>

92
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:36,445
<font color=#FFFF00>The driver kept talking on the phone while he was driving.</font>

93
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:39,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll talk to the principal first. Send her tomorrow.</font>

94
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:43,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, the driver is a really nice person.</font>

95
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:46,105
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter if he's nice or not.</font>

96
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,675
<font color=#FFFF00>He shouldn't be talking on the phone in the bus.</font>

97
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:51,705
<font color=#FFFF00>It might turn into a habit, and who knows what will happen?</font>

98
00:05:52,545 --> 00:05:53,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

99
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:56,575
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go to work today.</font>

100
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:58,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I will watch Ah In today.</font>

101
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

102
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I will watch her when I watch Ye Bin.</font>

103
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's your mother-in-law?</font>

104
00:06:04,705 --> 00:06:07,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think she can get up today.</font>

105
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:09,145
<font color=#FFFF00>That's understandable.</font>

106
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:10,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

107
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:15,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't like you. You should get out.</font>

108
00:06:15,545 --> 00:06:17,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I will talk Jeong Hwa out of it.</font>

109
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you tell her? What?</font>

110
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:22,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think she will listen to you just because you talk to her?</font>

111
00:06:24,345 --> 00:06:26,675
<font color=#FFFF00>- But still... - I don't know.</font>

112
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea.</font>

113
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even want to look at you. Get out.</font>

114
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:55,075
<font color=#FFFF00>He still hasn't called me.</font>

115
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,145
<font color=#FFFF00>How inconsiderate.</font>

116
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because of Jeong Hwa?</font>

117
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh. Are you there?</font>

118
00:07:12,205 --> 00:07:13,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

119
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:15,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

120
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,675
<font color=#FFFF00>It's before you head out for work, right?</font>

121
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry to bother you in the morning.</font>

122
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:22,275
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not bothering me.</font>

123
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon didn't come home last night.</font>

124
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,175
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering if something happened at work.</font>

125
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

126
00:07:32,405 --> 00:07:35,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard he went to the countryside for an urgent matter.</font>

127
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,145
<font color=#FFFF00>To the countryside? Why?</font>

128
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:41,505
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. I only heard it through a phone call.</font>

129
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:42,905
<font color=#FFFF00>What a brat.</font>

130
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,275
<font color=#FFFF00>He should have called me to let me know.</font>

131
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,005
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he do this?</font>

132
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I am relieved to hear...</font>

133
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,905
<font color=#FFFF00>he contacted you.</font>

134
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry to barge in at this hour.</font>

135
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:58,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You should get ready for work.</font>

136
00:07:58,705 --> 00:07:59,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

137
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,275
<font color=#FFFF00>The number you have dialed is unavailable.</font>

138
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,445
<font color=#FFFF00>- You'll be connected... - It's...</font>

139
00:08:10,445 --> 00:08:11,475
<font color=#FFFF00>- to voicemail. - turned off.</font>

140
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,305
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

141
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,175
<font color=#FFFF00>What is wrong with you? What have I done wrong?</font>

142
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,545
<font color=#FFFF00>You really don't know what you've done?</font>

143
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What have I done?</font>

144
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,975
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you throw a tantrum after you drank?</font>

145
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that the way to behave in front of our parents?</font>

146
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, honey!</font>

147
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,105
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let go of me. - What have you done right?</font>

148
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,105
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I heard...</font>

149
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:38,675
<font color=#FFFF00>you made our parents worry the most.</font>

150
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,245
<font color=#FFFF00>You got laid off and was hurt at a construction site.</font>

151
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,075
<font color=#FFFF00>You opened that restaurant with our parents' pension, right?</font>

152
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:46,015
<font color=#FFFF00>- You little brat. - Jeong Hwa.</font>

153
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,945
<font color=#FFFF00>You moved in here, but I can't?</font>

154
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:50,015
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stay at my parent's house comfortably?</font>

155
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I lived with my mother-in-law for seven years.</font>

156
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:55,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't I make myself at home in this house?</font>

157
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:57,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, this isn't your house. This is dad's and mom's house.</font>

158
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,345
<font color=#FFFF00>You are living off them too!</font>

159
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,805
<font color=#FFFF00>You aren't the only one. Seong Sik is also living off them.</font>

160
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,475
<font color=#FFFF00>So why are you picking on me?</font>

161
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:08,305
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you doing?</font>

162
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you yelling?</font>

163
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want your mother to hear this too?</font>

164
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:16,345
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - Father.</font>

165
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:18,375
<font color=#FFFF00>You brats.</font>

166
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:20,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, Dad.</font>

167
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:22,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

168
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,545
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go to work.</font>

169
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,345
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon. Let's talk. - Okay.</font>

170
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. You should get up now.</font>

171
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

172
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough is enough.</font>

173
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,775
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with you?</font>

174
00:09:48,205 --> 00:09:49,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Nowadays,</font>

175
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:52,305
<font color=#FFFF00>divorce isn't considered to be a flaw,</font>

176
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:54,305
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's not something to be proud of.</font>

177
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,375
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how difficult it is,</font>

178
00:09:56,605 --> 00:10:00,145
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think taking it out on your family is right.</font>

179
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,545
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I am stressed out.</font>

180
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you the only one who's stressed?</font>

181
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:06,675
<font color=#FFFF00>We are even more stressed out because of you.</font>

182
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Say that your stress level is 10, then our level is 100.</font>

183
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:11,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, you know what?</font>

184
00:10:11,805 --> 00:10:15,305
<font color=#FFFF00>The road you walked on before you got married was destroyed.</font>

185
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,275
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say? - That's why...</font>

186
00:10:17,275 --> 00:10:18,575
<font color=#FFFF00>your nickname is radioactivity.</font>

187
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:19,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

188
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,875
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been 17 years since I've been married.</font>

189
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:23,805
<font color=#FFFF00>You can treat me like a sister.</font>

190
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:27,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Look who's talking. You brought your grandmother and cousin.</font>

191
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:28,575
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

192
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,545
<font color=#FFFF00>"Look who's talking"?</font>

193
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you start a fight with her?</font>

194
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:36,575
<font color=#FFFF00>She has enough on her plate. She's already stressed out.</font>

195
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:39,345
<font color=#FFFF00>She was so rude...</font>

196
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,305
<font color=#FFFF00>in front of you and Mom.</font>

197
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:42,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave her alone.</font>

198
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:46,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Ye Bin will treat her the same way when she gets old.</font>

199
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:48,905
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be upset.</font>

200
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,975
<font color=#FFFF00>As your mother said, I don't know what children mean to me.</font>

201
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:55,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

202
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,605
<font color=#FFFF00>I shouldn't have burdened you.</font>

203
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,245
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

204
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:02,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not doing so well.</font>

205
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Running a fried chicken restaurant is good enough.</font>

206
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,305
<font color=#FFFF00>How about Seong Sik?</font>

207
00:11:08,205 --> 00:11:11,575
<font color=#FFFF00>He always makes mistakes and is very clumsy.</font>

208
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,675
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how he is.</font>

209
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:15,745
<font color=#FFFF00>What other choice do you have? You are his brother.</font>

210
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:17,945
<font color=#FFFF00>You should take care of him.</font>

211
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Which brings me to my next point.</font>

212
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you want to run another business?</font>

213
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:33,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. This time, it will certainly make profits.</font>

214
00:11:33,545 --> 00:11:35,605
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon. - I can't...</font>

215
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,605
<font color=#FFFF00>live off you forever.</font>

216
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:40,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa came back, and Seong Sik is struggling too.</font>

217
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:43,545
<font color=#FFFF00>I should lead our family since I am the oldest son.</font>

218
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:45,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Before I do that,</font>

219
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:48,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I should move out so that you won't be stressed out about me.</font>

220
00:11:49,205 --> 00:11:52,075
<font color=#FFFF00>I can also save my face in front of my younger siblings. Dad.</font>

221
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,575
<font color=#FFFF00>The money that goes into my children...</font>

222
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,745
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't a small amount.</font>

223
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:01,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if it isn't, how could you think this way?</font>

224
00:12:01,445 --> 00:12:03,745
<font color=#FFFF00>The item for this business will be successful for certain.</font>

225
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:07,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been thinking for a long time since my days as a journalist.</font>

226
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, right.</font>

227
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee, the neighbor decided to help me as well.</font>

228
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,505
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Lee? - Yes.</font>

229
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:16,405
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Lee across the street? - Yes.</font>

230
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:20,375
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of a person is he?</font>

231
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Lately, he is low in my favor.</font>

232
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. He had his reasons.</font>

233
00:12:25,505 --> 00:12:27,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you certain Mr. Lee will help you?</font>

234
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:28,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm certain.</font>

235
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:31,175
<font color=#FFFF00>So I ask you that you help me...</font>

236
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:32,805
<font color=#FFFF00>just this once.</font>

237
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you keep this a secret from Hye Joo for now?</font>

238
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,945
<font color=#FFFF00>- But still... - Dad.</font>

239
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:42,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

240
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Mr. Lee.</font>

241
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you talk now?</font>

242
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:50,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I can.</font>

243
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:52,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you now?</font>

244
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,075
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm at a company I invested in.</font>

245
00:12:54,675 --> 00:12:57,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I invested my money. I ought to follow through to see how it is.</font>

246
00:12:57,475 --> 00:12:59,245
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my life.</font>

247
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:02,445
<font color=#FFFF00>As is your right, of course.</font>

248
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:04,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

249
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:06,605
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

250
00:13:06,675 --> 00:13:09,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to meet you regarding the business we've discussed before.</font>

251
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you be available in the afternoon?</font>

252
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I am. Let's meet then.</font>

253
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,545
<font color=#FFFF00>I will contact you later.</font>

254
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:19,675
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Thank you. I will see you later.</font>

255
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:25,045
<font color=#FFFF00>It's either go big or go home.</font>

256
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:26,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Life is hard.</font>

257
00:13:31,105 --> 00:13:33,445
<font color=#FFFF00>It's cold. This is heavy.</font>

258
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon! How can you come to work so late?</font>

259
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,875
<font color=#FFFF00>So what if you are the owner?</font>

260
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:40,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Carry these now.</font>

261
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:42,775
<font color=#FFFF00>The headquarter sent us chickens.</font>

262
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:45,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You are so loud this morning.</font>

263
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:47,875
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because you don't do anything since you are the owner.</font>

264
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,805
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean I don't do anything?</font>

265
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:52,045
<font color=#FFFF00>You never do anything. Just now, you were on the phone, not helping me.</font>

266
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Who was it on the phone? Whom were you talking to?</font>

267
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so nosy.</font>

268
00:13:58,245 --> 00:14:01,105
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no law that says I must work with someone like you all day long.</font>

269
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,245
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take this. - This isn't even heavy.</font>

270
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,575
<font color=#FFFF00>- You jerk. - Do you think I want...</font>

271
00:14:04,575 --> 00:14:06,345
<font color=#FFFF00>to spend an entire day with you?</font>

272
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't kid yourself.</font>

273
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so mad. I'm so annoyed.</font>

274
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,675
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee.</font>

275
00:14:14,445 --> 00:14:16,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry to have kept you waiting.</font>

276
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,605
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need.</font>

277
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:19,975
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please take a seat. - Sure.</font>

278
00:14:21,805 --> 00:14:24,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang is testing...</font>

279
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,475
<font color=#FFFF00>our new products. So here I am.</font>

280
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:31,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to discuss with you.</font>

281
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:34,145
<font color=#FFFF00>You do?</font>

282
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,875
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it regarding?</font>

283
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:41,205
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm thinking of withdrawing my investment...</font>

284
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:43,105
<font color=#FFFF00>if the project continues to go on as it is now.</font>

285
00:14:45,545 --> 00:14:47,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you say that?</font>

286
00:14:49,145 --> 00:14:51,845
<font color=#FFFF00>The way Director Han works is very different...</font>

287
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:52,905
<font color=#FFFF00>from my approach of handling business.</font>

288
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:56,445
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems he doesn't think about money at all.</font>

289
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Doing whatever he wants to do isn't exactly called running a business.</font>

290
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:01,675
<font color=#FFFF00>On top of that,</font>

291
00:15:02,405 --> 00:15:05,345
<font color=#FFFF00>the rate the project is developing is quite slow.</font>

292
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to meet with Director Han and Bang regarding this matter,</font>

293
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,145
<font color=#FFFF00>but I couldn't even meet with them.</font>

294
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang is in charge of...</font>

295
00:15:15,275 --> 00:15:18,005
<font color=#FFFF00>supervising FGC's overall business.</font>

296
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:19,375
<font color=#FFFF00>What about Director Han?</font>

297
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:25,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... Director Han is...</font>

298
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,675
<font color=#FFFF00>From my perspective, I've invested a large sum of money.</font>

299
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think I'll be in a pickle if this continues?</font>

300
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:36,275
<font color=#FFFF00>The company might think that producing a drama is an excuse...</font>

301
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:37,605
<font color=#FFFF00>and I went to Korea to have fun and waste my investment.</font>

302
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Which made me think that it's not a bad idea...</font>

303
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,975
<font color=#FFFF00>for me to stop here.</font>

304
00:15:49,605 --> 00:15:51,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you not approve of...</font>

305
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:55,045
<font color=#FFFF00>- Director Han? - Well...</font>

306
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:00,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I decided to make an invest because of him in the beginning.</font>

307
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:05,405
<font color=#FFFF00>But as we proceeded with it, I couldn't trust him anymore.</font>

308
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:10,775
<font color=#FFFF00>If the project goes wrong, I'm the one who'd suffer a loss.</font>

309
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:14,445
<font color=#FFFF00>You wouldn't be the only one who'd suffer a loss...</font>

310
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:17,045
<font color=#FFFF00>if things go wrong.</font>

311
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:23,905
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be someone who'll be held accountable for this project.</font>

312
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:27,575
<font color=#FFFF00>That is...</font>

313
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that Director Han?</font>

314
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. Our company can lay...</font>

315
00:16:40,305 --> 00:16:43,545
<font color=#FFFF00>all the legal and financial responsibilities...</font>

316
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,045
<font color=#FFFF00>on Director Han.</font>

317
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:50,905
<font color=#FFFF00>That is why he is working really hard.</font>

318
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:53,005
<font color=#FFFF00>His life can be at stake.</font>

319
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,245
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is that so? - Sure.</font>

320
00:17:00,305 --> 00:17:03,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm relieved to hear that.</font>

321
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:10,775
<font color=#FFFF00>The number you have dialed is unavailable...</font>

322
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,475
<font color=#FFFF00>How is writing the scenario going these days?</font>

323
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:31,805
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good. I'm doing my best.</font>

324
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:38,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know that I made an investment in that drama?</font>

325
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:41,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

326
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

327
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Speaking of it,</font>

328
00:17:48,715 --> 00:17:52,675
<font color=#FFFF00>could you please leave Director Han alone?</font>

329
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,245
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

330
00:17:57,275 --> 00:18:00,215
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll try my best with the scenario...</font>

331
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,775
<font color=#FFFF00>until you're satisfied with it.</font>

332
00:18:04,845 --> 00:18:08,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you please stop meddling with the project...</font>

333
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:12,275
<font color=#FFFF00>so that he can make the best of his capabilities?</font>

334
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:19,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you backbite me in your room on the rooftop?</font>

335
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,875
<font color=#FFFF00>No, we don't.</font>

336
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,345
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not that kind of person.</font>

337
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:26,175
<font color=#FFFF00>He'd never do that.</font>

338
00:18:27,945 --> 00:18:30,845
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why do you cover up for him? - Sorry?</font>

339
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I almost thought you're his girlfriend.</font>

340
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:42,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I appreciate your opinion.</font>

341
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:46,745
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take that into account. See you.</font>

342
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,715
<font color=#FFFF00>I promise to do my best.</font>

343
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:55,045
<font color=#FFFF00>We can do it. Thank you in advance.</font>

344
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:12,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir, what are you doing here?</font>

345
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,775
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very sunny today.</font>

346
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:20,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Spring is here.</font>

347
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:23,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen?</font>

348
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,075
<font color=#FFFF00>No, nothing happened.</font>

349
00:19:28,745 --> 00:19:30,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just enjoying the lovely weather.</font>

350
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

351
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:38,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what I am doing now.</font>

352
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:41,045
<font color=#FFFF00>You're taking revenge.</font>

353
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:46,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have to put it that way?</font>

354
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I met Dong Hui who lives on the rooftop room.</font>

355
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:01,605
<font color=#FFFF00>I could see that she really likes Seong Joon.</font>

356
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:03,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you jealous?</font>

357
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:06,715
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

358
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:09,645
<font color=#FFFF00>It was disgusting instead.</font>

359
00:20:14,675 --> 00:20:15,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

360
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:18,045
<font color=#FFFF00>I was a little jealous too.</font>

361
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:22,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thinking what I did in her age.</font>

362
00:20:24,605 --> 00:20:27,715
<font color=#FFFF00>All I did were studying and working all day long.</font>

363
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,675
<font color=#FFFF00>As you said,</font>

364
00:20:31,845 --> 00:20:34,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I spent my young days planning the revenge...</font>

365
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:38,345
<font color=#FFFF00>and looking for my brother.</font>

366
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,745
<font color=#FFFF00>And he has a family who cares about him so much...</font>

367
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,805
<font color=#FFFF00>and a girlfriend who loves him.</font>

368
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

369
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,945
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not too late to back out.</font>

370
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:58,215
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how wicked I am.</font>

371
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:01,345
<font color=#FFFF00>What's with you?</font>

372
00:21:07,775 --> 00:21:08,875
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

373
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,645
<font color=#FFFF00>is your uncle's family all right?</font>

374
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,075
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure...</font>

375
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee would never let his family live happily.</font>

376
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:34,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, what brings you here?</font>

377
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:36,215
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Aunt here?</font>

378
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:39,475
<font color=#FFFF00>- She's in her room. - I see.</font>

379
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,375
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come to my house?</font>

380
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

381
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:48,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, I'm leaving.</font>

382
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:49,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you trying to run away?</font>

383
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:52,475
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all your fault.</font>

384
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:56,975
<font color=#FFFF00>You met him when you were on a trip and made him return to Korea.</font>

385
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:00,305
<font color=#FFFF00>This time, Hee Sook dragged him into my mom's house.</font>

386
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:03,305
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth do you think you're doing now?</font>

387
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:05,875
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean Hee Sook dragged him in?</font>

388
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:09,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, Jeong Eun,</font>

389
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll explain to you later.</font>

390
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:14,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry and leave. You should go.</font>

391
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,075
<font color=#FFFF00>You're always the worst troublemaker.</font>

392
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:20,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun, please leave. I'll see you later.</font>

393
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,045
<font color=#FFFF00>- Aunt. - Shut it.</font>

394
00:22:30,405 --> 00:22:33,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want me to do? Chang Soo has no instructor...</font>

395
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,905
<font color=#FFFF00>to help him to prepare for the coming competition.</font>

396
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,105
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean he has no instructor?</font>

397
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:41,045
<font color=#FFFF00>There are many instructors out there.</font>

398
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,045
<font color=#FFFF00>But he needs a world-class instructor.</font>

399
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:45,705
<font color=#FFFF00>So did you have to open up my old wound...</font>

400
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:48,205
<font color=#FFFF00>just to find a good teacher for Chang Soo?</font>

401
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:50,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say it's a wound?</font>

402
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:53,005
<font color=#FFFF00>- Don't you think it's so romantic? - What?</font>

403
00:22:53,645 --> 00:22:55,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say it's romantic?</font>

404
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:57,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Think carefully.</font>

405
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:02,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a happy woman.</font>

406
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:07,105
<font color=#FFFF00>There's hardly anyone who can still date a guy in your age.</font>

407
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:09,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Men don't even find women in my age attractive.</font>

408
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,845
<font color=#FFFF00>But your case is so special.</font>

409
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:16,045
<font color=#FFFF00>A charming man who still remembers you as his first love...</font>

410
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:19,545
<font color=#FFFF00>comes to you and calls you in a sweet voice like this,</font>

411
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:21,705
<font color=#FFFF00>"Ae Ri."</font>

412
00:23:24,845 --> 00:23:28,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I especially like him that he hasn't come back for the last 30 years.</font>

413
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,945
<font color=#FFFF00>What's good about that?</font>

414
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:33,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I had to suffer for 30 years.</font>

415
00:23:33,675 --> 00:23:37,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Living with one person for 30 years must've been more painful.</font>

416
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,545
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what Seong Sik is like.</font>

417
00:23:40,005 --> 00:23:44,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I lived with him for 16 years already.</font>

418
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:45,975
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'm seriously sick of him.</font>

419
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:50,575
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be grateful that he showed up so late.</font>

420
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:53,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet.</font>

421
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,705
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you're trying to sugarcoat it because it's none of your business.</font>

422
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:01,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt, please think positively.</font>

423
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:05,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that he made his comeback, Chang Soo might learn from him...</font>

424
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:07,045
<font color=#FFFF00>and make a good result at the competition.</font>

425
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it also a great opportunity for you...</font>

426
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:13,305
<font color=#FFFF00>to relieve your old grudges against him?</font>

427
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:17,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I no longer have anything to do with him.</font>

428
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,945
<font color=#FFFF00>And this isn't just about me. What about my mom?</font>

429
00:24:20,575 --> 00:24:23,175
<font color=#FFFF00>If that jerk gets caught by Mom,</font>

430
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,745
<font color=#FFFF00>he'd be as good as dead. Do you know that?</font>

431
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,905
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness. - What is it this time?</font>

432
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:34,005
<font color=#FFFF00>He's in our place now.</font>

433
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I must haven't come here.</font>

434
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,105
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's alone with Chang Soo there. - What?</font>

435
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:43,605
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart is</font>

436
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:47,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Young and green</font>

437
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:52,505
<font color=#FFFF00>So I shall live</font>

438
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:56,675
<font color=#FFFF00>In a blue mountain</font>

439
00:24:58,805 --> 00:25:03,405
<font color=#FFFF00>- During the long years - During the long years</font>

440
00:25:03,505 --> 00:25:06,045
<font color=#FFFF00>- After years - After years</font>

441
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:10,445
<font color=#FFFF00>- The whole world - The whole world</font>

442
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:16,875
<font color=#FFFF00>- Has changed - Has changed</font>

443
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:21,775
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yet the blue mountain - Yet the blue mountain</font>

444
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:26,745
<font color=#FFFF00>- Remains unchanged - Remains unchanged</font>

445
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:30,245
<font color=#FFFF00>- So I shall - So I shall</font>

446
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:37,175
<font color=#FFFF00>- Live in the blue mountain - Live in the blue mountain</font>

447
00:25:37,975 --> 00:25:40,545
<font color=#FFFF00>This spring</font>

448
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:43,805
<font color=#FFFF00>This is my favorite song composed by Kim Yeon Jun.</font>

449
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:45,445
<font color=#FFFF00>It's "I Shall Live In Green Mountain".</font>

450
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:48,245
<font color=#FFFF00>How can Chang Soo sing it so well?</font>

451
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:50,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you listening, Elizabeth?</font>

452
00:25:51,145 --> 00:25:54,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you listening to Chang Soo's singing?</font>

453
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:56,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

454
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:59,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I am listening.</font>

455
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:03,545
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're feeling okay, you should come out here.</font>

456
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:05,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you will hear it better.</font>

457
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, his voice is...</font>

458
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,545
<font color=#FFFF00>so loud and resonant.</font>

459
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,805
<font color=#FFFF00>You never know how children will turn out.</font>

460
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,705
<font color=#FFFF00>So you shouldn't look down on them because their grades are bad.</font>

461
00:26:16,045 --> 00:26:18,005
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to be patient and watch them.</font>

462
00:26:18,075 --> 00:26:21,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would've thought that Chang Soo could sing?</font>

463
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Right, Elizabeth?</font>

464
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

465
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:29,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this Chang Soo's voice?</font>

466
00:26:30,245 --> 00:26:32,305
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels strange.</font>

467
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

468
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:38,445
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this unpleasant feeling?</font>

469
00:26:40,205 --> 00:26:42,775
<font color=#FFFF00>This voice sounds very familiar.</font>

470
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it him?</font>

471
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:51,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop.</font>

472
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:55,175
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ae Ri. - Stop and hurry out.</font>

473
00:26:55,205 --> 00:26:57,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to escape.</font>

474
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma just called.</font>

475
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,445
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - She asked if Chang Soo is singing.</font>

476
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:05,545
<font color=#FFFF00>- You have to run. - Okay.</font>

477
00:27:05,545 --> 00:27:07,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up. Stop wasting time.</font>

478
00:27:07,745 --> 00:27:10,845
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come on. Hurry up. Go! - Run!</font>

479
00:27:10,845 --> 00:27:12,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, get your coat and follow me.</font>

480
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:13,875
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hurry up. - Okay.</font>

481
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:17,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up.</font>

482
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:19,145
<font color=#FFFF00>I am coming, girl.</font>

483
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:21,245
<font color=#FFFF00>- Run. - Okay.</font>

484
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:24,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Run.</font>

485
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:30,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is there nobody here?</font>

486
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:32,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are they?</font>

487
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:34,675
<font color=#FFFF00>This is strange.</font>

488
00:27:35,475 --> 00:27:38,705
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard someone singing.</font>

489
00:27:39,805 --> 00:27:42,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the unpleasant voice...</font>

490
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:45,875
<font color=#FFFF00>that came from under our windows 30 years ago.</font>

491
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:53,045
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

492
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this a man's handkerchief?</font>

493
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,675
<font color=#FFFF00>"Made in Italy".</font>

494
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there anyone in the house who's been to Italy?</font>

495
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe I'm doing this.</font>

496
00:28:09,305 --> 00:28:10,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome.</font>

497
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,445
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here, Jeong Eun?</font>

498
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:14,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you here to eat fried chicken?</font>

499
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Seong Hoon?</font>

500
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,575
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. He went out to meet someone.</font>

501
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:21,745
<font color=#FFFF00>He always makes me work and slacks off.</font>

502
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:23,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

503
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:27,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want anything?</font>

504
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik, do me a favor.</font>

505
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:32,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you answer my question honestly?</font>

506
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:33,805
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

507
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:38,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

508
00:28:39,645 --> 00:28:41,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't look at me with those scary eyes.</font>

509
00:28:41,975 --> 00:28:44,575
<font color=#FFFF00>It reminds me of the nightmare at the Public Prosecutors' Office.</font>

510
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:47,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik, why did you get fired from the TV show?</font>

511
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:49,045
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

512
00:28:49,505 --> 00:28:52,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you suddenly hitting me on a sore spot?</font>

513
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:53,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did I get fired?</font>

514
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:56,745
<font color=#FFFF00>That was...</font>

515
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:59,175
<font color=#FFFF00>because I had no connection.</font>

516
00:29:02,105 --> 00:29:04,805
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels so terrible when I think about that.</font>

517
00:29:05,975 --> 00:29:08,805
<font color=#FFFF00>And then what happened? What happened after that?</font>

518
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:10,245
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened after that?</font>

519
00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:12,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee introduced me...</font>

520
00:29:12,445 --> 00:29:15,945
<font color=#FFFF00>to Senior Secretary Kim Young Tae, and I almost became successful,</font>

521
00:29:15,975 --> 00:29:16,975
<font color=#FFFF00>although...</font>

522
00:29:18,245 --> 00:29:20,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I ended up like this in the end.</font>

523
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:21,805
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Goodness.</font>

524
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying it was Hyun Woo who introduced you...</font>

525
00:29:24,845 --> 00:29:25,875
<font color=#FFFF00>to that corrupt politician?</font>

526
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:27,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you surprised me.</font>

527
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:29,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey,</font>

528
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:32,305
<font color=#FFFF00>I was traumatized by the interrogation.</font>

529
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:35,345
<font color=#FFFF00>They questioned me day and night.</font>

530
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:39,905
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, Mr. Lee saved me from going to jail.</font>

531
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:41,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank goodness.</font>

532
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:45,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly, what did Mr. Lee do wrong?</font>

533
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,405
<font color=#FFFF00>It was my fault that I was blinded by the desire...</font>

534
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,945
<font color=#FFFF00>to win a position and did something illegal.</font>

535
00:29:50,645 --> 00:29:51,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

536
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:55,075
<font color=#FFFF00>how can a person be so great?</font>

537
00:29:55,275 --> 00:29:58,805
<font color=#FFFF00>The moment I saw him, I knew he wasn't just a construction manager.</font>

538
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:01,375
<font color=#FFFF00>But I never expected him to be the CEO of Golden Street.</font>

539
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:05,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you think it was strange?</font>

540
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,575
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

541
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:09,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you find it strange that he went from a construction manager...</font>

542
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:12,275
<font color=#FFFF00>to a CEO of an investment company?</font>

543
00:30:13,905 --> 00:30:16,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun, even Warren Buffett...</font>

544
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:19,775
<font color=#FFFF00>lives in the country town of Omaha, Nebraska,</font>

545
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,145
<font color=#FFFF00>disguised as an ordinary townsman.</font>

546
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:24,905
<font color=#FFFF00>He goes out to town in the morning to buy a newspaper.</font>

547
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,905
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the lifestyle of the true rich Americans.</font>

548
00:30:27,905 --> 00:30:31,375
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know anything. Goodness.</font>

549
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:35,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Our family is beyond help.</font>

550
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:38,975
<font color=#FFFF00>What does Seong Hoon think?</font>

551
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,675
<font color=#FFFF00>You know,</font>

552
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:44,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon is the biggest admirer of Mr. Lee.</font>

553
00:30:45,105 --> 00:30:47,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee helped him so much, you know?</font>

554
00:30:48,145 --> 00:30:49,275
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

555
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,545
<font color=#FFFF00>When he was laid off from work and was lost, Mr. Lee got him a job.</font>

556
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,645
<font color=#FFFF00>He got hurt after working only a short while,</font>

557
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:56,505
<font color=#FFFF00>but Mr. Lee paid him monthly pay, pension,</font>

558
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:59,105
<font color=#FFFF00>and even compensation.</font>

559
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did Seong Hoon get laid off from work?</font>

560
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course,</font>

561
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,445
<font color=#FFFF00>that's because he is incompetent.</font>

562
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:12,005
<font color=#FFFF00>He was so obsessed with that penguin business,</font>

563
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:13,575
<font color=#FFFF00>and he couldn't think about anything else.</font>

564
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,845
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he write good articles?</font>

565
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee helped him set up this restaurant too.</font>

566
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:21,005
<font color=#FFFF00>He rented out this place for a really cheap price.</font>

567
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee owns this building too.</font>

568
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:26,905
<font color=#FFFF00>He let me rent the office for a really cheap price too...</font>

569
00:31:27,205 --> 00:31:28,575
<font color=#FFFF00>when I was opening my own business.</font>

570
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:32,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss...</font>

571
00:31:33,405 --> 00:31:34,505
<font color=#FFFF00>that time.</font>

572
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:47,205
<font color=#FFFF00>I could go to your place.</font>

573
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:50,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought it would be uncomfortable for you.</font>

574
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:56,075
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think your family would be happy...</font>

575
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,775
<font color=#FFFF00>if they find out about your business plan.</font>

576
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you tell the elders about it?</font>

577
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:03,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I did. They are not too happy about it.</font>

578
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:06,105
<font color=#FFFF00>I've failed before, you know?</font>

579
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Honestly, I don't want to recommend it to you.</font>

580
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:16,245
<font color=#FFFF00>When it comes to business, it's all or nothing.</font>

581
00:32:17,445 --> 00:32:19,645
<font color=#FFFF00>I think your restaurant is doing quite well.</font>

582
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:21,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you trying to do a new business?</font>

583
00:32:23,105 --> 00:32:25,705
<font color=#FFFF00>I am a father and the eldest son of the family, you know?</font>

584
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,805
<font color=#FFFF00>My parents lost all their savings because of me.</font>

585
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:31,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik caused so much trouble,</font>

586
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:34,505
<font color=#FFFF00>and now he's serving at my restaurant.</font>

587
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:38,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, and my younger sister is now...</font>

588
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, my future is dark.</font>

589
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,445
<font color=#FFFF00>My children are still very young too.</font>

590
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:50,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel very frustrated.</font>

591
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:54,745
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a big responsibility.</font>

592
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:58,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. That's why I want to plan it thoroughly...</font>

593
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:02,205
<font color=#FFFF00>and raise my family.</font>

594
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:05,705
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance,</font>

595
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:08,445
<font color=#FFFF00>did you check my proposal?</font>

596
00:33:10,545 --> 00:33:12,175
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry,</font>

597
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:14,575
<font color=#FFFF00>but we are not experts in this area.</font>

598
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:18,475
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid we can't invest in your business.</font>

599
00:33:19,105 --> 00:33:20,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Is there...</font>

600
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:22,945
<font color=#FFFF00>absolutely no chance?</font>

601
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:25,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

602
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:30,205
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't go on like this.</font>

603
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:42,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I've recently met someone...</font>

604
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:43,605
<font color=#FFFF00>who's planning a business similar to this.</font>

605
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,145
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

606
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:48,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like to meet him?</font>

607
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:51,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

608
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:59,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that Dong Hui comes to work every day,</font>

609
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han doesn't come to work.</font>

610
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:03,775
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with our team?</font>

611
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:07,245
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. It's very unlike him.</font>

612
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, do you have any clue?</font>

613
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:14,045
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

614
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:17,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that he's going to a province.</font>

615
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:21,345
<font color=#FFFF00>To a province? Which province? Did he go on a business trip?</font>

616
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:22,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Hong, did he?</font>

617
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:24,775
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't know.</font>

618
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:29,205
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, it feels strange.</font>

619
00:34:29,305 --> 00:34:32,275
<font color=#FFFF00>How does Dong Hui know what we don't know?</font>

620
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:34,275
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I know.</font>

621
00:34:35,545 --> 00:34:37,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop being so ridiculous.</font>

622
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:41,045
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't help suspecting them when there are young people.</font>

623
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:43,745
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just that we're bored. We are bored.</font>

624
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han is acting strange these days.</font>

625
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:51,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did he go...</font>

626
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:54,115
<font color=#FFFF00>at this important time?</font>

627
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Mom and Dad?</font>

628
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:14,805
<font color=#FFFF00>They seemed very weak,</font>

629
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,875
<font color=#FFFF00>so I cooked chicken porridge for them.</font>

630
00:35:18,445 --> 00:35:20,375
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've treated them better before.</font>

631
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:21,905
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

632
00:35:22,045 --> 00:35:24,505
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the use of cooking them chicken porridge?</font>

633
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:26,905
<font color=#FFFF00>You all failed and invaded their place.</font>

634
00:35:28,205 --> 00:35:31,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo even brought her family with her.</font>

635
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa!</font>

636
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:36,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa, you should eat.</font>

637
00:35:36,445 --> 00:35:38,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Give me a glass of water.</font>

638
00:35:39,075 --> 00:35:40,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

639
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. I'll get you a glass of water.</font>

640
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:44,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

641
00:35:51,145 --> 00:35:52,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

642
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:55,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Ah In.</font>

643
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:57,975
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here are sausages. - Thank you.</font>

644
00:35:58,475 --> 00:36:02,045
<font color=#FFFF00>- Aunt. What about me? - Ask your mother.</font>

645
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,615
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's a delicious salad for you, Chang Soo.</font>

646
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:10,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. A salad won't be enough for me to sing.</font>

647
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:14,345
<font color=#FFFF00>You should still eat it. You didn't have vegetables today.</font>

648
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I will then if you say so.</font>

649
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:21,775
<font color=#FFFF00>What a nice boy. How can you listen to me so well?</font>

650
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:24,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Good boy. You are such a good son.</font>

651
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:27,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. What a soft touch you have.</font>

652
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:32,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you. You are so over the top.</font>

653
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:33,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. Hye Joo.</font>

654
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:35,205
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because I didn't eat sausages.</font>

655
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,575
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you act like this?</font>

656
00:36:41,705 --> 00:36:45,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. What is your point now?</font>

657
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really want to live having your children switched?</font>

658
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:50,145
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this mess? It's confusing me since I was away.</font>

659
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:53,205
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Hwa. What happened was... - Jeong Hwa.</font>

660
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,775
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a settled matter.</font>

661
00:36:58,145 --> 00:37:00,615
<font color=#FFFF00>We had a difficult time coping with the switch.</font>

662
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:03,405
<font color=#FFFF00>You might be confused since you were away.</font>

663
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:06,545
<font color=#FFFF00>From our perspective, you are beating a dead horse.</font>

664
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:09,775
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

665
00:37:09,945 --> 00:37:13,245
<font color=#FFFF00>So you should just have you meal. Make sure you chew well. Okay?</font>

666
00:37:14,005 --> 00:37:16,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, I don't want to eat.</font>

667
00:37:16,545 --> 00:37:19,615
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? You have to eat a lot if you want to grow taller.</font>

668
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:22,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. Make a fried egg for Ye Bin.</font>

669
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:26,045
<font color=#FFFF00>A fried egg?</font>

670
00:37:26,575 --> 00:37:28,675
<font color=#FFFF00>- Calm down. - Make one please.</font>

671
00:37:28,905 --> 00:37:31,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. I will make one right away.</font>

672
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:49,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo. How did you end up learning vocal music?</font>

673
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:52,505
<font color=#FFFF00>My school teacher recommended it.</font>

674
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:55,475
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what?</font>

675
00:37:55,745 --> 00:37:58,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Pavarotti isn't good at singing because he's fat.</font>

676
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:02,115
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because he's a good opera singer, we don't hold it against it.</font>

677
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:05,475
<font color=#FFFF00>You should lose some weight.</font>

678
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:08,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Nowadays, opera singers are slim and handsome.</font>

679
00:38:08,475 --> 00:38:10,675
<font color=#FFFF00>They watch their figure like a soccer player.</font>

680
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:14,675
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - And you, Ji Hoon.</font>

681
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:18,575
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going to be a magician? - Yes. I plan on it.</font>

682
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:22,575
<font color=#FFFF00>You think every magician succeeds like David Copperfield.</font>

683
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:24,115
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not true.</font>

684
00:38:24,475 --> 00:38:27,945
<font color=#FFFF00>You know people make desperate effort in order to become magicians.</font>

685
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,305
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't put all of your effort into it, you will end up...</font>

686
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:34,275
<font color=#FFFF00>taking out a rabbit or a pigeon out of a hat at a preschool recital.</font>

687
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,745
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - And you, Ah In.</font>

688
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:40,175
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes? - Can't you speak English well?</font>

689
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:42,405
<font color=#FFFF00>"Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Thank you." Is this all you can do?</font>

690
00:38:42,575 --> 00:38:46,075
<font color=#FFFF00>I think for the time we stay here, you should learn from Ye Bin.</font>

691
00:38:46,205 --> 00:38:47,205
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

692
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:55,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. Calm down.</font>

693
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:59,205
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I calm down? She treats us like servants. She says things...</font>

694
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,805
<font color=#FFFF00>she shouldn't say in front of our children. How can I stay calm?</font>

695
00:39:03,005 --> 00:39:05,045
<font color=#FFFF00>She's stressed out.</font>

696
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:08,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her this morning that she's not the only one who's stressed out.</font>

697
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,675
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do? Will you fight in front of Father rand Mother?</font>

698
00:39:11,745 --> 00:39:14,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me know if a daughter-in-law won after fighting her sister-in-law.</font>

699
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:15,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Then should I back off?</font>

700
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Then are you going to get a sword and lead a troop?</font>

701
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:21,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Please compose yourself.</font>

702
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:24,845
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter. We will forever be subordinates to her.</font>

703
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:29,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook. Since when have you become obedient...</font>

704
00:39:29,205 --> 00:39:30,845
<font color=#FFFF00>and accommodating?</font>

705
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:33,075
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know me well.</font>

706
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Except for my children's education,</font>

707
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:37,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I was always obedient and accommodating.</font>

708
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,045
<font color=#FFFF00>My husband...</font>

709
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:46,075
<font color=#FFFF00>cheated on me with that Anchor Jang Yoo Ra.</font>

710
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:49,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though the whole country knows about the affair,</font>

711
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:51,745
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't even bat an eye.</font>

712
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,805
<font color=#FFFF00>It only took me four days to recover.</font>

713
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:58,175
<font color=#FFFF00>In that sense, I hold you to the highest respect.</font>

714
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:02,615
<font color=#FFFF00>Some people are never meant to grow up. It's water under the bridge.</font>

715
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:05,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa is one of them.</font>

716
00:40:06,045 --> 00:40:08,175
<font color=#FFFF00>She will never come to her senses.</font>

717
00:40:08,575 --> 00:40:10,975
<font color=#FFFF00>So let's not turn this into a big deal.</font>

718
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't we just hold back? Okay, Hye Joo?</font>

719
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,145
<font color=#FFFF00>- But still... - Hye Joo.</font>

720
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:16,775
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. You're so close we might kiss.</font>

721
00:40:16,775 --> 00:40:19,575
<font color=#FFFF00>- So what? - Have you gone mad?</font>

722
00:40:20,705 --> 00:40:22,505
<font color=#FFFF00>- Calm down. - Stop it.</font>

723
00:40:25,045 --> 00:40:27,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. Where are the children?</font>

724
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:31,775
<font color=#FFFF00>- They went down after we talked. - They did?</font>

725
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:35,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I see. Are you going somewhere at this late hour?</font>

726
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to buy coffee. We ran out. Why?</font>

727
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:40,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to get it for me? I need to help Ye Bin brush her teeth.</font>

728
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,645
<font color=#FFFF00>What a shame. I have to help Ah In brush her teeth too.</font>

729
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:48,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you ask if you weren't going to get it for me?</font>

730
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:51,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Are you all right, Jeong Hwa?</font>

731
00:40:56,115 --> 00:40:58,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa. Are you okay?</font>

732
00:40:58,305 --> 00:41:01,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you hurt? You should've been more careful.</font>

733
00:41:01,705 --> 00:41:04,845
<font color=#FFFF00>You should stop by a pharmacy too.</font>

734
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:09,005
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo. - What?</font>

735
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,615
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you doing? - You're here.</font>

736
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,645
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

737
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this yours?</font>

738
00:41:23,405 --> 00:41:25,445
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not. Where did you get it?</font>

739
00:41:27,075 --> 00:41:29,905
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is weird. - What is weird?</font>

740
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:31,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

741
00:41:32,775 --> 00:41:34,245
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you don't look so good.</font>

742
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,375
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's because of Seong Joon. - What is it?</font>

743
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:40,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Did something happen to him?</font>

744
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:43,145
<font color=#FFFF00>He hasn't come home for days without calling us.</font>

745
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:44,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he was on a business trip.</font>

746
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,805
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what Dong Hui said.</font>

747
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,805
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter how urgent it is.</font>

748
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:54,945
<font color=#FFFF00>He never forgets to call and inform us.</font>

749
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,875
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

750
00:41:58,345 --> 00:41:59,645
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

751
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:03,745
<font color=#FFFF00>- it's because of Jeong Hwa. - What?</font>

752
00:42:04,075 --> 00:42:06,875
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how Jeong Hwa bullies him.</font>

753
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,675
<font color=#FFFF00>She even bullied him on the day he came here.</font>

754
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:11,775
<font color=#FFFF00>He thinks he's not welcomed even if we welcome him.</font>

755
00:42:12,205 --> 00:42:15,045
<font color=#FFFF00>It must've been hard on him. He must have felt uncomfortable...</font>

756
00:42:15,245 --> 00:42:19,345
<font color=#FFFF00>after finding out Jeong Hwa will stay with us for a while.</font>

757
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,475
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that Jeong Hwa isn't exactly the agreeable type.</font>

758
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:26,115
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, you need to reflect on your wrongdoings.</font>

759
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:28,845
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to spoil her.</font>

760
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:31,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Just because she was your only daughter,</font>

761
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:35,045
<font color=#FFFF00>you spoiled her by treating her like a princess.</font>

762
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:38,805
<font color=#FFFF00>Look how selfish she turned out to be.</font>

763
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:42,045
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no one to blame, but myself.</font>

764
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:47,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Poor Seong Joon.</font>

765
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,145
<font color=#FFFF00>(A car accident in Bangbae-dong, 1993)</font>

766
00:43:03,045 --> 00:43:04,045
<font color=#FFFF00>(Geumbit Academy's bus was turned over.)</font>

767
00:43:08,145 --> 00:43:11,745
<font color=#FFFF00>(Geumbit Academy's bus)</font>

768
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:30,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop drove your father to death.</font>

769
00:43:47,845 --> 00:43:51,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of Dong Hui as your cousin and get along with her.</font>

770
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:53,445
<font color=#FFFF00>If she were alive,</font>

771
00:43:54,205 --> 00:43:56,845
<font color=#FFFF00>she'd be the biggest shareholder. Do you know that?</font>

772
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you will have no place in this company.</font>

773
00:43:59,545 --> 00:44:02,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Ms. Oh that important to you, Dad?</font>

774
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:05,575
<font color=#FFFF00>20 years ago, she was a very special person...</font>

775
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:08,245
<font color=#FFFF00>for your grandmother.</font>

776
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,745
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Bang Mi Joo. Under Oh Dong Hui's family history,</font>

777
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:21,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh Gui Boon should be listed.</font>

778
00:44:22,005 --> 00:44:23,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you do a background check on her?</font>

779
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:28,605
<font color=#FFFF00>And get me the files regarding Chairwoman Park's disappearance.</font>

780
00:44:31,175 --> 00:44:33,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you feeling better?</font>

781
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am.</font>

782
00:44:36,605 --> 00:44:38,575
<font color=#FFFF00>Perhaps, you were exhausted.</font>

783
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:41,305
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I wasn't.</font>

784
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,045
<font color=#FFFF00>My house is quite big.</font>

785
00:44:45,545 --> 00:44:47,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, people with resources...</font>

786
00:44:49,045 --> 00:44:51,745
<font color=#FFFF00>always live in a big house.</font>

787
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:55,945
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, I think my father relies on you a lot.</font>

788
00:44:57,345 --> 00:44:59,075
<font color=#FFFF00>He doesn't rely on me.</font>

789
00:44:59,245 --> 00:45:01,705
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just because I raised him since he was young.</font>

790
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:03,745
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just an attachment, nothing else.</font>

791
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:07,405
<font color=#FFFF00>From what I have gathered, I learned you were quite close...</font>

792
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:09,105
<font color=#FFFF00>with my grandmother who passed away.</font>

793
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:15,645
<font color=#FFFF00>She did take good care of me.</font>

794
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:19,405
<font color=#FFFF00>It was after I lost my husband.</font>

795
00:45:19,975 --> 00:45:23,145
<font color=#FFFF00>I relied on her quite a lot.</font>

796
00:45:24,475 --> 00:45:28,045
<font color=#FFFF00>She understood and looked out for me.</font>

797
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:32,605
<font color=#FFFF00>My gratitude towards her still hasn't changed.</font>

798
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:37,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you must be aware of...</font>

799
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:38,975
<font color=#FFFF00>my grandmother's disappearance.</font>

800
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:42,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I was informed after her disappearance.</font>

801
00:45:44,145 --> 00:45:47,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I came to ask you something.</font>

802
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:53,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think the reason why my dad is putting off reporting...</font>

803
00:45:53,105 --> 00:45:55,475
<font color=#FFFF00>my grandmother's death is because he believes she is still alive.</font>

804
00:45:56,005 --> 00:45:59,145
<font color=#FFFF00>If it is, he shouldn't have reported Hyun Jeong's death either.</font>

805
00:46:02,505 --> 00:46:04,405
<font color=#FFFF00>If he admits that my grandmother is dead,</font>

806
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,975
<font color=#FFFF00>her will would automatically be revealed.</font>

807
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:11,775
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be afraid of what the will might state.</font>

808
00:46:12,975 --> 00:46:14,045
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I wanted to ask you...</font>

809
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:17,875
<font color=#FFFF00>if you know what my grandmother's will says.</font>

810
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:22,675
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I know what it says?</font>

811
00:46:22,675 --> 00:46:25,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a copy of it then?</font>

812
00:46:26,345 --> 00:46:29,045
<font color=#FFFF00>No. That's not possible.</font>

813
00:46:29,045 --> 00:46:32,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it say anything about Bang Hyun Jeong,</font>

814
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:33,745
<font color=#FFFF00>my cousin?</font>

815
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:37,145
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I don't know that.</font>

816
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

817
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:41,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

818
00:46:41,705 --> 00:46:44,175
<font color=#FFFF00>How would I know anything about it?</font>

819
00:46:44,575 --> 00:46:47,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Even your father doesn't know what it says.</font>

820
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:52,075
<font color=#FFFF00>There is no way a mere housekeeper like me knows what it's about.</font>

821
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:58,175
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think my grandmother's alive.</font>

822
00:46:58,505 --> 00:47:00,905
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been 20 years since her disappearance.</font>

823
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:02,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe...</font>

824
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,775
<font color=#FFFF00>we should follow her will whether it's advantageous...</font>

825
00:47:06,745 --> 00:47:09,375
<font color=#FFFF00>to me and my dad or not. It's what she wanted.</font>

826
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:11,705
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you...</font>

827
00:47:11,945 --> 00:47:14,145
<font color=#FFFF00>to convince my dad to report my grandmother's death...</font>

828
00:47:14,675 --> 00:47:16,345
<font color=#FFFF00>as soon as possible.</font>

829
00:47:16,845 --> 00:47:19,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I know my dad relies on you like you're his real mother.</font>

830
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:22,175
<font color=#FFFF00>You can at least do that, right?</font>

831
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

832
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:29,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if I can.</font>

833
00:47:32,745 --> 00:47:33,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides,</font>

834
00:47:37,345 --> 00:47:38,645
<font color=#FFFF00>wouldn't it be possible...</font>

835
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:40,505
<font color=#FFFF00>that your grandmother...</font>

836
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,775
<font color=#FFFF00>is still alive somewhere?</font>

837
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:45,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

838
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:49,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Your grandmother is such a strong person.</font>

839
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,275
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

840
00:47:54,445 --> 00:47:55,645
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

841
00:47:57,805 --> 00:48:01,575
<font color=#FFFF00>I suddenly started to miss her.</font>

842
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:06,905
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm greatly indebted to her.</font>

843
00:48:19,845 --> 00:48:21,505
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

844
00:48:22,005 --> 00:48:24,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Can't I be here?</font>

845
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:26,275
<font color=#FFFF00>You came to my place the other day,</font>

846
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:27,975
<font color=#FFFF00>so I came to yours this time.</font>

847
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm being childish?</font>

848
00:48:30,145 --> 00:48:32,105
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm glad you came.</font>

849
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:35,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come back inside. I'll cook you some noodles.</font>

850
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Director Han?</font>

851
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:38,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Has he come back yet?</font>

852
00:48:39,775 --> 00:48:40,805
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

853
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:42,445
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think the reason is?</font>

854
00:48:43,175 --> 00:48:44,775
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

855
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:48,145
<font color=#FFFF00>He has never behaved this way for the last five years.</font>

856
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:50,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying I'm responsible for this as well?</font>

857
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:53,775
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying you're good at meddling in others' business.</font>

858
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,075
<font color=#FFFF00>If your scripts for episodes 3 and 4 don't get picked,</font>

859
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:58,845
<font color=#FFFF00>you should give up completely. You know that, right?</font>

860
00:48:58,875 --> 00:49:00,705
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I do know that.</font>

861
00:49:00,875 --> 00:49:03,175
<font color=#FFFF00>- Quit your job at the company too. - Excuse me?</font>

862
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:05,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to be involved with you anymore.</font>

863
00:49:06,245 --> 00:49:07,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll pay off your brother's debt...</font>

864
00:49:07,975 --> 00:49:09,675
<font color=#FFFF00>with my own money.</font>

865
00:49:10,005 --> 00:49:13,205
<font color=#FFFF00>If your scripts don't get picked, please resign.</font>

866
00:49:14,075 --> 00:49:17,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, stop coming to my house even if my dad asks you to.</font>

867
00:49:17,845 --> 00:49:20,575
<font color=#FFFF00>We see each other at work and at home too.</font>

868
00:49:20,705 --> 00:49:22,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that too tiring for both of us?</font>

869
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:25,645
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the one who came to my house today.</font>

870
00:49:25,705 --> 00:49:28,305
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't your house. It's Director Han's house.</font>

871
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:31,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Please tell him to call me when he comes back.</font>

872
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:41,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to become a famous writer,</font>

873
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,575
<font color=#FFFF00>and I'm never going to work with you.</font>

874
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:46,375
<font color=#FFFF00>You will see.</font>

875
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:53,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay still. I'm going to dry your hair for you.</font>

876
00:49:54,445 --> 00:49:55,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. I'm here.</font>

877
00:49:56,345 --> 00:49:59,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come? You should be making dinner downstairs.</font>

878
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:02,145
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I didn't want you to take care of Ye Bin by yourself.</font>

879
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:03,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Father?</font>

880
00:50:03,445 --> 00:50:06,475
<font color=#FFFF00>He went to the supermarket to buy yogurt for Ye Bin.</font>

881
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me that towel. I'll dry her hair.</font>

882
00:50:10,045 --> 00:50:11,075
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

883
00:50:11,245 --> 00:50:14,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Ye Bin. Let's sit on the sofa. I'll dry your hair.</font>

884
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:24,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. I know you must be upset.</font>

885
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:27,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I am.</font>

886
00:50:28,345 --> 00:50:29,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure there will be a solution.</font>

887
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:33,145
<font color=#FFFF00>No, there isn't. They've already filed a suit.</font>

888
00:50:33,145 --> 00:50:34,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing will solve it now.</font>

889
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:38,845
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa and her husband didn't understand each other.</font>

890
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,075
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll be better for Jeong Hwa to just split up with him.</font>

891
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,275
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure...</font>

892
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:45,305
<font color=#FFFF00>if she's doing the right thing.</font>

893
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,645
<font color=#FFFF00>You still shouldn't stay inside the house all day.</font>

894
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,075
<font color=#FFFF00>It'll stress you out more.</font>

895
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:52,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have aerobics classes anymore?</font>

896
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have time to go to aerobics classes.</font>

897
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:00,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa is causing trouble now right after Seong Sik's scandal.</font>

898
00:51:00,905 --> 00:51:04,045
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too embarrassed to even go out of the house now.</font>

899
00:51:04,445 --> 00:51:08,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, I have to babysit Ye Bin. I can't go anywhere.</font>

900
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:11,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Jeong Hwa?</font>

901
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:13,875
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. She just went out.</font>

902
00:51:14,545 --> 00:51:15,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did she go?</font>

903
00:51:23,475 --> 00:51:26,275
<font color=#FFFF00>You're as beautiful as always, Ms. Han.</font>

904
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:30,175
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not true. I'm a woman who has a child now.</font>

905
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:33,245
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true. You don't look much different from before.</font>

906
00:51:33,545 --> 00:51:35,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, sir.</font>

907
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,705
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Are you back for good?</font>

908
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:39,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I guess so.</font>

909
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:42,405
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you want to meet me because you wanted to come back to work?</font>

910
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:46,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. If you give me a good show to host, I won't say no.</font>

911
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:51,345
<font color=#FFFF00>But you'll have to compete with the young anchors.</font>

912
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:55,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I suppose.</font>

913
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:58,675
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very hard to host a good show...</font>

914
00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:02,705
<font color=#FFFF00>even for young and popular anchors.</font>

915
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:06,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

916
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:10,475
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing this weekend?</font>

917
00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:12,905
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - Do you want to play golf with me?</font>

918
00:52:16,205 --> 00:52:17,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

919
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:27,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

920
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:33,875
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

921
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:38,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

922
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:56,545
<font color=#FFFF00>You look tired today.</font>

923
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:58,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I wrong?</font>

924
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:02,475
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I had a long day.</font>

925
00:53:04,245 --> 00:53:05,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have any beer?</font>

926
00:53:05,645 --> 00:53:07,605
<font color=#FFFF00>I think beer suits this house...</font>

927
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,645
<font color=#FFFF00>better than coffee.</font>

928
00:53:10,905 --> 00:53:11,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I got both.</font>

929
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:27,605
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep your place very neat.</font>

930
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,845
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels as if you're only staying here temporarily.</font>

931
00:53:32,845 --> 00:53:33,975
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just my personality.</font>

932
00:53:42,245 --> 00:53:44,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Beer tastes great when I feel frustrated.</font>

933
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:49,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you worried about something?</font>

934
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,175
<font color=#FFFF00>No one has given me a job yet.</font>

935
00:53:53,705 --> 00:53:56,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it would be hard to go back to work after seven years,</font>

936
00:53:57,445 --> 00:53:59,875
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm a little upset because it's not going so well.</font>

937
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:04,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

938
00:54:05,105 --> 00:54:06,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like me to help you?</font>

939
00:54:08,575 --> 00:54:11,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm still confused whether you're just being kind...</font>

940
00:54:12,545 --> 00:54:13,745
<font color=#FFFF00>or you're interested in me.</font>

941
00:54:21,045 --> 00:54:22,145
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it ugly?</font>

942
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:26,275
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a deep scar.</font>

943
00:54:27,905 --> 00:54:29,405
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a big accident.</font>

944
00:54:30,845 --> 00:54:31,905
<font color=#FFFF00>An accident?</font>

945
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:36,305
<font color=#FFFF00>That accident left a scar on my life.</font>

946
00:54:36,575 --> 00:54:38,375
<font color=#FFFF00>A scar that can't be forever removed.</font>

947
00:55:01,705 --> 00:55:02,775
<font color=#FFFF00>Did it hurt?</font>

948
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:05,245
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure.</font>

949
00:55:05,945 --> 00:55:07,405
<font color=#FFFF00>It must have hurt a lot.</font>

950
00:55:12,105 --> 00:55:13,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

951
00:55:17,075 --> 00:55:18,175
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a scar that...</font>

952
00:55:18,745 --> 00:55:20,445
<font color=#FFFF00>doesn't suit such a beauty like you.</font>

953
00:55:27,905 --> 00:55:29,345
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we go and get some fresh air?</font>

954
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:42,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. You can see our house so well from here.</font>

955
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:47,775
<font color=#FFFF00>You can see the whole neighborhood here.</font>

956
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:53,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Our house looks so old now. It used to be the best building before.</font>

957
00:55:55,075 --> 00:55:56,375
<font color=#FFFF00>It should be rebuilt.</font>

958
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:01,875
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think about Channel T?</font>

959
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:04,675
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you'll be great on a show about current events.</font>

960
00:56:05,505 --> 00:56:06,905
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a competent man.</font>

961
00:56:07,345 --> 00:56:09,275
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... I thought you knew.</font>

962
00:56:10,445 --> 00:56:13,005
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you want me to do in return?</font>

963
00:56:25,345 --> 00:56:27,745
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure. Why don't you...</font>

964
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:30,045
<font color=#FFFF00>give me some time to think about it?</font>

965
00:56:31,845 --> 00:56:33,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you always like this?</font>

966
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:37,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... On some level.</font>

967
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:53,245
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a bit cold. Shall we go back in?</font>

968
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,045
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I think we got enough fresh air.</font>

969
00:57:04,745 --> 00:57:05,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I just don't know...</font>

970
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:10,105
<font color=#FFFF00>what you're trying to get from doing this.</font>

971
00:57:19,445 --> 00:57:21,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I actually felt very lonely today.</font>

972
00:57:22,445 --> 00:57:23,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

973
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:28,205
<font color=#FFFF00>I also felt lonely today. Thank you for a lovely time.</font>

974
00:57:31,575 --> 00:57:32,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you still single?</font>

975
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:35,945
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you getting divorced?</font>

976
00:57:39,075 --> 00:57:40,105
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

977
00:57:41,745 --> 00:57:44,405
<font color=#FFFF00>If I had known such a great man was living across from my house,</font>

978
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I would've come back sooner.</font>

979
00:57:48,245 --> 00:57:49,805
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel the same way.</font>

980
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:53,745
<font color=#FFFF00>I can go by myself from here.</font>

981
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:59,905
<font color=#FFFF00>- I guess that's better. - Good night.</font>

982
00:58:00,905 --> 00:58:02,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Good night, Jeong Hwa.</font>

983
00:58:20,505 --> 00:58:21,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't do this.</font>

984
00:58:23,145 --> 00:58:24,705
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like dying.</font>

985
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:27,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I really feel like I'm going to die.</font>

986
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,145
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Eun. - That's right.</font>

987
00:58:33,445 --> 00:58:35,775
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Han Jeong Eun, the woman you once liked.</font>

988
00:58:38,705 --> 00:58:39,945
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to come here.</font>

989
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:44,345
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I not? I can't just let you ruin yourself.</font>

990
00:58:44,845 --> 00:58:46,975
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't let my family get ruined.</font>

991
00:58:47,075 --> 00:58:49,345
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't let myself get ruined.</font>

992
00:58:49,975 --> 00:58:51,445
<font color=#FFFF00>Go and tell them then.</font>

993
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:55,675
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your uncle and tell him who I am.</font>

994
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo. Please.</font>

995
00:59:01,445 --> 00:59:03,305
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm tired of all this too.</font>

996
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:06,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell your whole family to settle things with me...</font>

997
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:08,945
<font color=#FFFF00>once and for all.</font>

998
00:59:47,645 --> 00:59:49,205
<font color=#FFFF00>That's Mr. Lee.</font>

999
00:59:51,745 --> 00:59:53,745
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he was a decent guy.</font>

1000
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:55,905
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he doing with a woman on the street?</font>

1001
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:01,645
<font color=#FFFF00>This is hard for me too.</font>

1002
01:00:03,075 --> 01:00:05,945
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hyun Woo. - Please go back.</font>

1003
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:13,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo. Hyun Woo!</font>

1004
01:00:37,075 --> 01:00:38,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

1005
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,305
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I made you wait for so long.</font>

1006
01:00:45,905 --> 01:00:47,375
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I didn't answer my phone.</font>

1007
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,775
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

1008
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:55,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You look terrible. What happened?</font>

1009
01:00:58,775 --> 01:01:00,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

1010
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:28,505
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me a minute. I'm going to make some tea.</font>

1011
01:01:28,805 --> 01:01:30,305
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be cold. Please sit.</font>

1012
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:34,105
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

1013
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:43,075
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Why are you doing this?</font>

1014
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:47,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you tell me you were going on a business trip?</font>

1015
01:02:48,505 --> 01:02:51,475
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been doing? You look haggard.</font>

1016
01:02:51,745 --> 01:02:53,545
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I want my breakfast.</font>

1017
01:02:53,805 --> 01:02:56,005
<font color=#FFFF00>I set it up for you too. Where is Ye Bin?</font>

1018
01:02:56,045 --> 01:02:57,805
<font color=#FFFF00>She's still sleeping. She won't wake up.</font>

1019
01:02:58,545 --> 01:03:00,805
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's been a long time. - Yes.</font>

1020
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:05,275
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you can't just go on a business trip without saying a word.</font>

1021
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:07,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom and Dad were worried about you.</font>

1022
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:12,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Are you the one who raised him so poorly like this?</font>

1023
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,875
<font color=#FFFF00>You're in no place to say such a thing.</font>

1024
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,175
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so immature. You need to grow up.</font>

1025
01:03:17,475 --> 01:03:19,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, he shouldn't have done that.</font>

1026
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:22,105
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he treat his parents so rudely?</font>

1027
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:29,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you having breakfast, Seong Joon?</font>

1028
01:03:35,575 --> 01:03:36,605
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

1029
01:03:40,045 --> 01:03:41,175
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

1030
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:45,075
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

1031
01:03:46,705 --> 01:03:48,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something wrong?</font>

1032
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:51,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Nothing is wrong.</font>

1033
01:03:51,345 --> 01:03:55,105
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is everyone picking on him? Seong Joon. Come on and eat.</font>

1034
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:58,245
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be quiet too.</font>

1035
01:03:59,345 --> 01:04:01,805
<font color=#FFFF00>You always say mean things at breakfast.</font>

1036
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:04,475
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't changed at all.</font>

1037
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:08,305
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... I'll have breakfast later.</font>

1038
01:04:08,605 --> 01:04:09,605
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

1039
01:04:12,105 --> 01:04:13,205
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

1040
01:04:16,445 --> 01:04:18,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear. What's wrong with him?</font>

1041
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:24,005
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he just do that to make me feel uncomfortable? My gosh.</font>

1042
01:04:48,445 --> 01:04:49,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

1043
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:55,475
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on out.</font>

1044
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:17,675
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with you?</font>

1045
01:05:24,445 --> 01:05:26,375
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have something to say to me?</font>

1046
01:05:30,245 --> 01:05:31,645
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

1047
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:34,605
<font color=#FFFF00>You're making me upset.</font>

1048
01:05:37,445 --> 01:05:38,445
<font color=#FFFF00>I have...</font>

1049
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,205
<font color=#FFFF00>something I want to ask you.</font>

1050
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:44,545
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1051
01:05:49,605 --> 01:05:50,845
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

1052
01:05:53,145 --> 01:05:54,145
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance,</font>

1053
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:58,245
<font color=#FFFF00>did you...</font>

1054
01:06:01,105 --> 01:06:03,805
<font color=#FFFF00>make my biological father die?</font>

1055
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:09,905
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true...</font>

1056
01:06:12,675 --> 01:06:15,145
<font color=#FFFF00>that you made my biological father die?</font>

1057
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:24,975
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

1058
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:51,045
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1059
01:06:51,305 --> 01:06:53,245
<font color=#FFFF00>Checking her identity...</font>

1060
01:06:53,545 --> 01:06:56,645
<font color=#FFFF00>might make us lucky.</font>

1061
01:06:56,705 --> 01:06:57,745
<font color=#FFFF00>Until when...</font>

1062
01:06:58,145 --> 01:07:01,105
<font color=#FFFF00>do I have to live as if I don't exist?</font>

1063
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:04,175
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, Seong Joon has a woman.</font>

1064
01:07:04,345 --> 01:07:06,175
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Dong Hui.</font>

1065
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,575
<font color=#FFFF00>My uncle really believed...</font>

1066
01:07:08,745 --> 01:07:11,145
<font color=#FFFF00>that your father had been drunk-driving.</font>

1067
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:12,645
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me.</font>

1068
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:16,075
<font color=#FFFF00>Who am I? What are you keeping from me?</font>
