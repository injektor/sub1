1
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:08,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think it's too late to ask for forgiveness?</font>

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,489
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 39)</font>

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:12,691
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you think your wrongdoing would be justified if you raise Sang Woo?</font>

4
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:16,989
<font color=#FFFF00>I know I don't deserve to be forgiven.</font>

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I've ruined...</font>

6
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,389
<font color=#FFFF00>a guy's life.</font>

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,159
<font color=#FFFF00>And his young children have gone...</font>

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,159
<font color=#FFFF00>through a lot because of me.</font>

9
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,159
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I be forgiven?</font>

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,299
<font color=#FFFF00>If you know that well,</font>

11
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,529
<font color=#FFFF00>why did you come here?</font>

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to leave now.</font>

13
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:40,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave already!</font>

14
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:41,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Before that,</font>

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,789
<font color=#FFFF00>please let me ask you a favor.</font>

16
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:48,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

17
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:50,589
<font color=#FFFF00>leave...</font>

18
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:54,689
<font color=#FFFF00>with Seong Joon as soon as possible.</font>

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,359
<font color=#FFFF00>My family thinks...</font>

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,729
<font color=#FFFF00>he's my own son.</font>

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,159
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

22
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:10,129
<font color=#FFFF00>if they find out that he's not my son...</font>

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:14,459
<font color=#FFFF00>but the driver's son,</font>

24
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,559
<font color=#FFFF00>they will abandon...</font>

25
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon coldly.</font>

26
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:24,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Then they will blame...</font>

27
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:26,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon...</font>

28
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,429
<font color=#FFFF00>for everything.</font>

29
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,759
<font color=#FFFF00>So what does it have to do with us?</font>

30
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:37,159
<font color=#FFFF00>We no longer...</font>

31
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,259
<font color=#FFFF00>want to be entangled with you.</font>

32
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,629
<font color=#FFFF00>That'd be better for me as well.</font>

33
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:44,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Before it's too late,</font>

34
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,159
<font color=#FFFF00>before everyone finds out the truth,</font>

35
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,429
<font color=#FFFF00>please leave with Seong Joon.</font>

36
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,729
<font color=#FFFF00>That's for Seong Joon's sake.</font>

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

38
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you afraid that your family will know what you've done in the past?</font>

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,189
<font color=#FFFF00>You used to be a good father, a good husband, and a good neighbor.</font>

40
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you're afraid that others might find out your true colors?</font>

41
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,899
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you took Sang Woo away from me and raised him?</font>

42
00:02:12,929 --> 00:02:14,789
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you try to cover your sins like this?</font>

43
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a coward and a scum.</font>

44
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:20,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

45
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please stop. - See?</font>

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you know who this guy you believed to be your dad...</font>

47
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,029
<font color=#FFFF00>really is!</font>

48
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:46,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Please get up.</font>

49
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home.</font>

50
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:01,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

51
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

52
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:06,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

53
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:12,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo!</font>

54
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,029
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

55
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me walk him home.</font>

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,729
<font color=#FFFF00>We can talk later.</font>

57
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Dad.</font>

58
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:32,559
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Joon... - Hurry up.</font>

59
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

60
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your brother.</font>

61
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:34,699
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your brother.</font>

62
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:37,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me take you home.</font>

63
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

64
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,989
<font color=#FFFF00>You should be cursing me out and kicking me with him.</font>

65
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this?</font>

66
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:50,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't be nice to me.</font>

67
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:53,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to him now.</font>

68
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say anything.</font>

69
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:01,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

70
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

71
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:12,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik. Spread the blankets for him.</font>

72
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,429
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Okay. I'm going.</font>

73
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:16,729
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey. Hyung Seop. - Honey. What's wrong?</font>

74
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:18,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. What's wrong with him?</font>

75
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:20,429
<font color=#FFFF00>He was fine a little while ago. What's going on?</font>

76
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:21,589
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - Oh my.</font>

77
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,629
<font color=#FFFF00>- Slowly. Be careful. - Hyung Seop.</font>

78
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:27,489
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's up with him? - Dad. Should we go to the hospital?</font>

79
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:29,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. Should I take you there?</font>

80
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:31,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop. Pull yourself together.</font>

81
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What's gotten into you lately?</font>

82
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:36,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Seong Joon. Where did you go with Dad?</font>

83
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Why can't you answer me?</font>

84
00:05:40,329 --> 00:05:43,029
<font color=#FFFF00>He was fine when he went out, but now he's not in good condition.</font>

85
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did you go?</font>

86
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I will tell you later.</font>

87
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hear him?</font>

88
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,429
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you act so rude?</font>

89
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:54,089
<font color=#FFFF00>You ought to answer when I ask you a question.</font>

90
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going now?</font>

91
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave him alone.</font>

92
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't bother him.</font>

93
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

94
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:25,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he doing again?</font>

95
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:34,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

96
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really have to do this?</font>

97
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:37,789
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

98
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:38,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

99
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,989
<font color=#FFFF00>he is just a poor, weak old man.</font>

100
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:46,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What is your point?</font>

101
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:47,889
<font color=#FFFF00>You are right.</font>

102
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,689
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a bad person.</font>

103
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,189
<font color=#FFFF00>He shouldn't have done that,</font>

104
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:53,529
<font color=#FFFF00>no matter how precious his children were to him.</font>

105
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:55,029
<font color=#FFFF00>He shouldn't have mistreated and ignored...</font>

106
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,629
<font color=#FFFF00>poor people just because he had money.</font>

107
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:01,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I also hate and despise that kind of people.</font>

108
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:02,889
<font color=#FFFF00>If you know this,</font>

109
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,529
<font color=#FFFF00>how can you take him outside in front of me?</font>

110
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:08,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you will calm down. If you don't,</font>

111
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,089
<font color=#FFFF00>you are no better than my father 20 years ago.</font>

112
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is your father?</font>

113
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:21,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still call him your father?</font>

114
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:23,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father...</font>

115
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,859
<font color=#FFFF00>wasn't a selfish old man. He was a poor bus driver.</font>

116
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,459
<font color=#FFFF00>He had no connections or anyone to rely on.</font>

117
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,329
<font color=#FFFF00>There wasn't a single person who'd listen to his complaints.</font>

118
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,589
<font color=#FFFF00>A pitiful bus driver who was penniless...</font>

119
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,889
<font color=#FFFF00>- is your father. - I know.</font>

120
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how my defenseless father passed away...</font>

121
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,559
<font color=#FFFF00>and what mistake my current father made to him,</font>

122
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,659
<font color=#FFFF00>- but... - No.</font>

123
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:47,659
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know.</font>

124
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

125
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:21,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what this is?</font>

126
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:26,589
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the tie our father hanged himself with.</font>

127
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,159
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the tie Han Hyung Seop loosened...</font>

128
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,189
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to beat up our father.</font>

129
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Our father...</font>

130
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:37,689
<font color=#FFFF00>picked this up and hanged himself.</font>

131
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:41,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

132
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:45,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still feel...</font>

133
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:50,229
<font color=#FFFF00>sympathy for that vicious man after seeing this?</font>

134
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still pity him?</font>

135
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

136
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:57,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give me some time.</font>

137
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,659
<font color=#FFFF00>How much more time do you need?</font>

138
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:01,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been waiting for 23 years.</font>

139
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you everything.</font>

140
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Even at this moment, I'm waiting for you.</font>

141
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I need time to hate him.</font>

142
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,529
<font color=#FFFF00>You had 23 years.</font>

143
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:16,799
<font color=#FFFF00>I had only a few weeks.</font>

144
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,529
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sang Woo. - During the last 23 years,</font>

145
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:23,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I trusted and followed my father.</font>

146
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,929
<font color=#FFFF00>During that time, my father wasn't a dead bus driver.</font>

147
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,589
<font color=#FFFF00>It was Han Hyung Seop.</font>

148
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:35,229
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a long period of time.</font>

149
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,389
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I...</font>

150
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:39,529
<font color=#FFFF00>throw away those years overnight?</font>

151
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be weak.</font>

152
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:42,759
<font color=#FFFF00>You are not a kid.</font>

153
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,799
<font color=#FFFF00>So please. I beg of you to give me some time.</font>

154
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,559
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

155
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

156
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,459
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

157
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Get a grip!</font>

158
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I'm going out.</font>

159
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,589
<font color=#FFFF00>How's Dad?</font>

160
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see?</font>

161
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:21,089
<font color=#FFFF00>He hasn't moved an inch since last night.</font>

162
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:23,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't bother Dad.</font>

163
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,059
<font color=#FFFF00>You should ask Seong Joon.</font>

164
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

165
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:31,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I think the reason why he's acting like this has to do with Seong Joon.</font>

166
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Bring Seong Joon and ask him.</font>

167
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

168
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,799
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking nonsense and just go.</font>

169
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,299
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right? Can you sit up?</font>

170
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:47,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

171
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to go.</font>

172
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I'm going.</font>

173
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk tonight.</font>

174
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,389
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going somewhere? - Yes.</font>

175
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,189
<font color=#FFFF00>You should say your greetings in the morning properly and go.</font>

176
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. She's so rude.</font>

177
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:24,359
<font color=#FFFF00>So please tell me.</font>

178
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:27,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What is going on with you these days?</font>

179
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:28,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you feeling better?</font>

180
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,029
<font color=#FFFF00>What was Jeong Hwa talking about?</font>

181
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother mentioned something about that too.</font>

182
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,389
<font color=#FFFF00>You told Mother that Seong Joon was not your son.</font>

183
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you tell her that? What do you mean by that?</font>

184
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:45,129
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - Hyung Seop.</font>

185
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:48,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what's going on with you.</font>

186
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think it's better to...</font>

187
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,829
<font color=#FFFF00>tell your mother and wife at least?</font>

188
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What you told me troubled me greatly.</font>

189
00:11:58,229 --> 00:11:59,729
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I told Jeong Ae what you told me.</font>

190
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't bear this by myself.</font>

191
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,859
<font color=#FFFF00>So tell us. What happened?</font>

192
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you bringing up Seong Joon's past now?</font>

193
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:11,959
<font color=#FFFF00>You brought him home because you said he was your son.</font>

194
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,289
<font color=#FFFF00>You said he was born out of wedlock.</font>

195
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,429
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you tell us he's not your son now?</font>

196
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't press him for an answer. Speak softly.</font>

197
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

198
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,089
<font color=#FFFF00>I lived with this man for 40 years and he seems to be sly.</font>

199
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,589
<font color=#FFFF00>20 years ago, he said he had an affair...</font>

200
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,359
<font color=#FFFF00>and brought a child home.</font>

201
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Now he's telling us that it wasn't true.</font>

202
00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:33,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Then whose family does he belong to?</font>

203
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:36,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you turn someone else's son into yours and bring him home?</font>

204
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:40,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Whom have I been raising for 20 years?</font>

205
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:44,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, if this is the case, this is more aggravating.</font>

206
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,489
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to feel aggravated by this.</font>

207
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's hear him out.</font>

208
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:52,659
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not explaining himself.</font>

209
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:55,329
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I feel more insulted and uncomfortable.</font>

210
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Stop it. Ask Seong Joon when he comes back.</font>

211
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Ask him if he knows something.</font>

212
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:02,359
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance,</font>

213
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,659
<font color=#FFFF00>does Seong Joon know about this?</font>

214
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:08,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you weren't getting alone well lately?</font>

215
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

216
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

217
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,289
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not the time for you to feel glum.</font>

218
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,389
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not Ji Hoon's first time rebelling against you.</font>

219
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, does it really matter in what place he is ranked?</font>

220
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,289
<font color=#FFFF00>What good is it if he's ranked first?</font>

221
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,289
<font color=#FFFF00>The house he's living in now has been put up as a collateral.</font>

222
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:32,259
<font color=#FFFF00>His father will be a manager of a fried chicken restaurant...</font>

223
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,389
<font color=#FFFF00>or a mediocre lawyer if things keep going as it is now.</font>

224
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:38,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone needs to come up with a plan to lead this family.</font>

225
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:41,259
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

226
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:43,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's going to lead this family?</font>

227
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be me, of course.</font>

228
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Please know your place.</font>

229
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:49,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of you,</font>

230
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,229
<font color=#FFFF00>the children are bullied at school.</font>

231
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell them to wait a bit.</font>

232
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell them their father will return as a new, reformed man.</font>

233
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:00,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't just think about your success.</font>

234
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:03,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to get Ji Hoon to study again.</font>

235
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:06,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo is excelling at singing,</font>

236
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:08,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon's grades has dramatically gone down.</font>

237
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo isn't the type to nag Ji Hoon to study.</font>

238
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,429
<font color=#FFFF00>It might help if I don't see him.</font>

239
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:16,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Living in the same house isn't helping.</font>

240
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,889
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm about to lose my mind. - Shut it!</font>

241
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet!</font>

242
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

243
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:25,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you really think about someone else than your children?</font>

244
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:28,929
<font color=#FFFF00>The grown-ups must be successful for the children to be successful.</font>

245
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:30,759
<font color=#FFFF00>He's only in his third year of middle school.</font>

246
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:34,359
<font color=#FFFF00>It will take forever for a teenager to restore his family.</font>

247
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- So what's your plan? - Why do you even ask?</font>

248
00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:40,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that he wants to make money by getting a mortgage,</font>

249
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,059
<font color=#FFFF00>I will regain...</font>

250
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>the tarnished reputation of our family using my old fame.</font>

251
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Reputation is money, right?</font>

252
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make some money with the reputation...</font>

253
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,329
<font color=#FFFF00>and get out of this house as soon as possible...</font>

254
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,729
<font color=#FFFF00>and no longer argue with my brother. Okay?</font>

255
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll move out of this house.</font>

256
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, where are you going?</font>

257
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,259
<font color=#FFFF00>You should go talk to Ji Hoon. Honey!</font>

258
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

259
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:11,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

260
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:13,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang on a second.</font>

261
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

262
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my goodness.</font>

263
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:21,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Where on earth are we going?</font>

264
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to tell me?</font>

265
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:32,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off the car.</font>

266
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:55,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are we?</font>

267
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to bury me because I'm against your business?</font>

268
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I bury you?</font>

269
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I bury my wife who spent half her life with me?</font>

270
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to show you how you will live in comfort...</font>

271
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,159
<font color=#FFFF00>from now on.</font>

272
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:18,189
<font color=#FFFF00>- Live in comfort? - Hye Joo.</font>

273
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch carefully.</font>

274
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:25,159
<font color=#FFFF00>From here to there,</font>

275
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:27,929
<font color=#FFFF00>there will be the main building of the theme park.</font>

276
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:31,359
<font color=#FFFF00>There will be amenities for visitors over there.</font>

277
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,859
<font color=#FFFF00>And over there will be...</font>

278
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,589
<font color=#FFFF00>a huge aquarium.</font>

279
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,759
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where? - Right over there.</font>

280
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:42,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you see it?</font>

281
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,859
<font color=#FFFF00>- I don't see anything. - Hey.</font>

282
00:16:46,429 --> 00:16:48,989
<font color=#FFFF00>You will see them once they are built.</font>

283
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:52,389
<font color=#FFFF00>World-famous architects will design the buildings.</font>

284
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,789
<font color=#FFFF00>The buildings will stand out.</font>

285
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han, you are here.</font>

286
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know you were here.</font>

287
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course. We will start construction soon.</font>

288
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:02,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

289
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I came here with my wife.</font>

290
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you?</font>

291
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,499
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nice to meet you, ma'am.</font>

292
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,829
<font color=#FFFF00>When will you start construction?</font>

293
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,559
<font color=#FFFF00>We will start early next week.</font>

294
00:17:14,889 --> 00:17:17,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Take a look at this.</font>

295
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:19,759
<font color=#FFFF00>As you can see, this is the main building.</font>

296
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,929
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the aquarium.</font>

297
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure you looked into it closely?</font>

298
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:32,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

299
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:37,499
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel relieved at heart just by looking at the land.</font>

300
00:17:38,459 --> 00:17:39,999
<font color=#FFFF00>As a man,</font>

301
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:42,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've had...</font>

302
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,629
<font color=#FFFF00>a big dream just like this. Don't you think?</font>

303
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:49,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure everything is okay?</font>

304
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:51,389
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

305
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:53,889
<font color=#FFFF00>They will start construction next week.</font>

306
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:58,289
<font color=#FFFF00>So are you sure you checked the whole thing?</font>

307
00:17:58,999 --> 00:18:00,659
<font color=#FFFF00>- You are... - Hye Joo.</font>

308
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,289
<font color=#FFFF00>There will be a light...</font>

309
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,689
<font color=#FFFF00>at the end of the tunnel.</font>

310
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,559
<font color=#FFFF00>(Inbox)</font>

311
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:27,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't the sales report ready yet?</font>

312
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,689
<font color=#FFFF00>It has never happened before.</font>

313
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, Dong Hui was in charge of the work.</font>

314
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,329
<font color=#FFFF00>So? Are you saying it's not ready because she's not here?</font>

315
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:41,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you using her as an excuse?</font>

316
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:44,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry. I will have it ready as soon as possible.</font>

317
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Writer Choi. Did you get my message?</font>

318
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,689
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too busy to give you a call.</font>

319
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:02,589
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean you want to stay out of this?</font>

320
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:06,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi, please don't be upset.</font>

321
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,089
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand it hurt your feelings.</font>

322
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,229
<font color=#FFFF00>As you know, Oh Dong Hui is a novice writer.</font>

323
00:19:11,389 --> 00:19:14,529
<font color=#FFFF00>She won't be able to write well due to her lack of persistence.</font>

324
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,789
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure she will give up writing soon.</font>

325
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,189
<font color=#FFFF00>So please...</font>

326
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi! Writer Choi!</font>

327
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:25,999
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

328
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is already fired.</font>

329
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would write the script now?</font>

330
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you run away just to be at a place like this?</font>

331
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know that Gui Boon ran away from my father?</font>

332
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:54,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon has a connection...</font>

333
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,129
<font color=#FFFF00>with my grandmother who was the chairwoman.</font>

334
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,859
<font color=#FFFF00>My father is looking for Gui Boon...</font>

335
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:03,859
<font color=#FFFF00>to find my grandmother and her will.</font>

336
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:05,729
<font color=#FFFF00>All I'm saying...</font>

337
00:20:06,229 --> 00:20:08,029
<font color=#FFFF00>is that you shouldn't trample...</font>

338
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,629
<font color=#FFFF00>on her time and trouble to hide in a remote town...</font>

339
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,529
<font color=#FFFF00>just because of your stupid love stuff.</font>

340
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:30,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

341
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get caught by your grandmother again?</font>

342
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,499
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't send me an email.</font>

343
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:37,659
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't even read my email yet.</font>

344
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everything all right?</font>

345
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:42,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried.</font>

346
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:44,259
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just too long...</font>

347
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,089
<font color=#FFFF00>to wait until the weekend.</font>

348
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:48,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

349
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:52,459
<font color=#FFFF00>You nailed the scripts for episode 5 and 6 again.</font>

350
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to celebrate it with you.</font>

351
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,059
<font color=#FFFF00>(Your mail has been successfully sent.)</font>

352
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:13,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim, how are you?</font>

353
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,689
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Han Seong Sik.</font>

354
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:18,959
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

355
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim.</font>

356
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:28,159
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come here?</font>

357
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:29,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

358
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:32,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

359
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just here to pay my respects to you.</font>

360
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Your respects?</font>

361
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:40,559
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come here after doing such things?</font>

362
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:41,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Why...</font>

363
00:21:42,229 --> 00:21:44,689
<font color=#FFFF00>are you upset? What did I do wrong?</font>

364
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I just went to the prosecutor's office...</font>

365
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,429
<font color=#FFFF00>and had seolleongtang. That's it.</font>

366
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:52,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I had six bowls of seolleongtang.</font>

367
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:56,589
<font color=#FFFF00>How could a small fry like you...</font>

368
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,059
<font color=#FFFF00>work as a mole?</font>

369
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:00,789
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

370
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You and Lee Hyun Woo of Jinsung Daily News...</font>

371
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,659
<font color=#FFFF00>revealed the relations...</font>

372
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:07,329
<font color=#FFFF00>between Seonghan Group and Minjeong Party.</font>

373
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:10,189
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What did you say?</font>

374
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. He said he'd get me...</font>

375
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,429
<font color=#FFFF00>a smart and obedient guy as a scapegoat.</font>

376
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,159
<font color=#FFFF00>- It was a dirty trick. - What?</font>

377
00:22:20,189 --> 00:22:22,329
<font color=#FFFF00>- A scapegoat? A dirty trick? - Shut your mouth.</font>

378
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:25,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Lee Hyun Woo of Jinsung Daily News...</font>

379
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:27,289
<font color=#FFFF00>got me a stupid and loud guy like you...</font>

380
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:28,929
<font color=#FFFF00>on purpose.</font>

381
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Then he made me a fool...</font>

382
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,289
<font color=#FFFF00>printing out the newspapers.</font>

383
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:34,389
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

384
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:37,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What exactly do you mean?</font>

385
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:41,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying Lee Hyun Woo...</font>

386
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:44,529
<font color=#FFFF00>used me as a scapegoat?</font>

387
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:47,729
<font color=#FFFF00>To reveal the connection between you and Seonghan Group?</font>

388
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:51,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik.</font>

389
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:54,359
<font color=#FFFF00>There's not much to say about it.</font>

390
00:22:54,489 --> 00:22:56,689
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let you set foot in this business again.</font>

391
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't even think about...</font>

392
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:02,689
<font color=#FFFF00>working in politics or broadcasting.</font>

393
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of my office now.</font>

394
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:08,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim.</font>

395
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim!</font>

396
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:21,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying...</font>

397
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:24,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I should drop the case...</font>

398
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:25,729
<font color=#FFFF00>and settle my divorce?</font>

399
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. They say you should do that...</font>

400
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:29,829
<font color=#FFFF00>if you want to take your child.</font>

401
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:33,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Why do you think I stayed married to him for seven years?</font>

402
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should I step back without getting a penny?</font>

403
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:38,729
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't fair.</font>

404
00:23:39,129 --> 00:23:41,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't cheat on him.</font>

405
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,629
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hard to prove your innocence about the photos.</font>

406
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,289
<font color=#FFFF00>They say Jinsung Daily News who spread the photos...</font>

407
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,659
<font color=#FFFF00>passed the information to James Jeong.</font>

408
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:51,689
<font color=#FFFF00>The photos were taken...</font>

409
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,829
<font color=#FFFF00>to catch you having an affair.</font>

410
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:58,189
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say? Jinsung Daily News?</font>

411
00:24:00,489 --> 00:24:03,629
<font color=#FFFF00>My older brother used to work there.</font>

412
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:05,929
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't have an entertainment department.</font>

413
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:09,259
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. They were just a daily paper.</font>

414
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,459
<font color=#FFFF00>But they were recently taken over by Golden Street...</font>

415
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:14,529
<font color=#FFFF00>and has expanded the firm.</font>

416
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Then they created an entertainment department.</font>

417
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:19,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

418
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say Golden Street?</font>

419
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:24,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. It is an investment company...</font>

420
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,559
<font color=#FFFF00>based on Wall Street.</font>

421
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:29,629
<font color=#FFFF00>They've made their way to Korea eating up many domestic companies.</font>

422
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:32,929
<font color=#FFFF00>The CEO is David Lee.</font>

423
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:35,959
<font color=#FFFF00>He's very famous in that industry.</font>

424
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:37,229
<font color=#FFFF00>David Lee?</font>

425
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:39,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean Lee Hyun Woo?</font>

426
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:41,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, that's right.</font>

427
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,459
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk.</font>

428
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa! Jeong Hwa!</font>

429
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,729
<font color=#FFFF00>There you are!</font>

430
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,159
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir! - Jeong Hwa!</font>

431
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:01,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay, sir?</font>

432
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

433
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:06,059
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

434
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

435
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:09,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know?</font>

436
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you're the CEO of Jinsung Daily News.</font>

437
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:16,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you tell them to upload my pictures? Did you?</font>

438
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:22,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

439
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:23,889
<font color=#FFFF00>What's your real identity?</font>

440
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:27,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me? What did I do to you?</font>

441
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:33,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me. Tell me, you jerk!</font>

442
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:35,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it your hobby to ruin a person's life?</font>

443
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Calm down, Jeong Hwa. Don't do this here.</font>

444
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:38,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa, what are you doing?</font>

445
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't stop me.</font>

446
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:43,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of this jerk, all the struggles I put up with...</font>

447
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,929
<font color=#FFFF00>during my marriage became useless.</font>

448
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:48,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost my divorce trial!</font>

449
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:50,459
<font color=#FFFF00>He did that to you too?</font>

450
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:51,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Move.</font>

451
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee!</font>

452
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to talk to you too.</font>

453
00:25:56,859 --> 00:25:58,789
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you do to me?</font>

454
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I just met Senior Secretary Kim.</font>

455
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:05,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that you wanted to use me as a scapegoat?</font>

456
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:09,189
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's going on with you? - Let go!</font>

457
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I have just as many things to say to him as Jeong Hwa.</font>

458
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

459
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:15,829
<font color=#FFFF00>At least tell me the reason.</font>

460
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I do something wrong to you?</font>

461
00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:21,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I do so wrong...</font>

462
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,829
<font color=#FFFF00>to make you tear me into pieces?</font>

463
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you.</font>

464
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not a charity worker.</font>

465
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you fools for expecting...</font>

466
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:36,659
<font color=#FFFF00>my favor without any reason or anything in return?</font>

467
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:39,389
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

468
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:41,929
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

469
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:43,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I your family?</font>

470
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I your relative?</font>

471
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Or are we even friends?</font>

472
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,629
<font color=#FFFF00>On what grounds did you ask for my favor?</font>

473
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I am just your next door neighbor.</font>

474
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you should've acted like a next door neighbor!</font>

475
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:00,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you? Why?</font>

476
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,659
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to know the other reason,</font>

477
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,959
<font color=#FFFF00>go ask your father.</font>

478
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,889
<font color=#FFFF00>He would know much better than me.</font>

479
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Dad... Where is Dad?</font>

480
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, where is Dad?</font>

481
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking for him?</font>

482
00:27:20,189 --> 00:27:22,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you making a fuss together?</font>

483
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad! Are you in there?</font>

484
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:29,359
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

485
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:33,989
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on? Why are they making such a fuss?</font>

486
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, why is Mr. Lee, our neighbor...</font>

487
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:41,429
<font color=#FFFF00>doing these harms to us?</font>

488
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:45,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

489
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,589
<font color=#FFFF00>He told me to ask Dad.</font>

490
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:51,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked him why he's making our lives miserable,</font>

491
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:52,859
<font color=#FFFF00>and he told me to ask Dad.</font>

492
00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:55,689
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? How did he make your lives miserable?</font>

493
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, Grandmother, everything bad that happened to our family...</font>

494
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:01,659
<font color=#FFFF00>was because of Mr. Lee.</font>

495
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:04,689
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? Tell me in a way that I understand.</font>

496
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:07,089
<font color=#FFFF00>The whole story was revealed just today.</font>

497
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:09,489
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the one who made Jeong Hwa lose the divorce trial...</font>

498
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,689
<font color=#FFFF00>by making that scandalous photos go viral.</font>

499
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:14,859
<font color=#FFFF00>It was also him who persuaded me to get into politics...</font>

500
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:17,459
<font color=#FFFF00>after getting fired from the broadcasting job.</font>

501
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

502
00:28:19,629 --> 00:28:22,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you listening, Mom?</font>

503
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:24,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

504
00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:26,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Can it also be him...</font>

505
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:30,029
<font color=#FFFF00>who made me lose my broadcasting job?</font>

506
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it obvious?</font>

507
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,859
<font color=#FFFF00>He wouldn't even have broken a sweat firing you.</font>

508
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:38,859
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is happening?</font>

509
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, what happened?</font>

510
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:46,159
<font color=#FFFF00>After all he's done,</font>

511
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,059
<font color=#FFFF00>he didn't even look guilty. He proudly told us...</font>

512
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,689
<font color=#FFFF00>to ask you what happened.</font>

513
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,989
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? You know everything, right?</font>

514
00:28:54,389 --> 00:28:57,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me quickly. Will you?</font>

515
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:01,359
<font color=#FFFF00>So are you saying you all became like this...</font>

516
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,589
<font color=#FFFF00>- because of Mr. Lee, the neighbor? - Goodness.</font>

517
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,629
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - Grandmother! Grandmother!</font>

518
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:12,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, please tell me.</font>

519
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it, all of you!</font>

520
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you see that Uncle is in pain?</font>

521
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:20,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you torturing him when you don't know anything?</font>

522
00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:21,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop making him miserable.</font>

523
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,059
<font color=#FFFF00>You know something, don't you?</font>

524
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Know what?</font>

525
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me to watch out for Hyun Woo.</font>

526
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:30,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Even before all these happened,</font>

527
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,389
<font color=#FFFF00>you told me to watch out for him because he's a dangerous man.</font>

528
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,889
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew something when you said that, right?</font>

529
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:38,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. Jeong Eun,</font>

530
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:42,329
<font color=#FFFF00>you asked me loads of questions when you came to our restaurant.</font>

531
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:43,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that?</font>

532
00:29:43,629 --> 00:29:44,989
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

533
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us everything now!</font>

534
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you blaming me? It's not my fault!</font>

535
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Whose fault is it then?</font>

536
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,829
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all your fault!</font>

537
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:02,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Honey!</font>

538
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:05,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay, Honey?</font>

539
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:14,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I will pour it for you.</font>

540
00:30:14,189 --> 00:30:16,359
<font color=#FFFF00>- Never mind. - Come on.</font>

541
00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:27,889
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

542
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you really sure about this?</font>

543
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I'm sure about it. Why would I do it otherwise?</font>

544
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,589
<font color=#FFFF00>You're silly.</font>

545
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:41,729
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what that money means, don't you?</font>

546
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:44,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't spoil the fun.</font>

547
00:30:45,129 --> 00:30:46,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course I know.</font>

548
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:52,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't particularly like my mother-in-law,</font>

549
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:56,529
<font color=#FFFF00>but still, I don't want anything to happen to their money.</font>

550
00:30:57,729 --> 00:30:59,759
<font color=#FFFF00>They lived for 70 years,</font>

551
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,259
<font color=#FFFF00>and that house is all they've got.</font>

552
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,159
<font color=#FFFF00>If you use that house as a collateral,</font>

553
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:09,989
<font color=#FFFF00>then you really are a bad son to them.</font>

554
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I know that.</font>

555
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:15,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I doing this for myself?</font>

556
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I am doing this so that I can provide better for them...</font>

557
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,259
<font color=#FFFF00>and to raise our children better.</font>

558
00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:23,089
<font color=#FFFF00>But still, honey, you have to know this.</font>

559
00:31:24,489 --> 00:31:26,359
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a sin for a child who's older than 40 years old...</font>

560
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,429
<font color=#FFFF00>to be depending on his parents like this.</font>

561
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:31,659
<font color=#FFFF00>You should really be ashamed of yourself.</font>

562
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,589
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I am trying to make money and...</font>

563
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:36,059
<font color=#FFFF00>get out of their house.</font>

564
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:42,659
<font color=#FFFF00>I am really not sure if it's a right decision.</font>

565
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:44,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch me.</font>

566
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:48,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Later you will say that it was the right thing to do.</font>

567
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,429
<font color=#FFFF00>It's already happened,</font>

568
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,659
<font color=#FFFF00>so I can only hope that it will be a success.</font>

569
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:54,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

570
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,659
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

571
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,359
<font color=#FFFF00>our children saw everything we did.</font>

572
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What will we do if Ji Hoon grows up and asks us to fund his business?</font>

573
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:06,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I won't know what to say.</font>

574
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us, Jeong Eun.</font>

575
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us everything you know.</font>

576
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually...</font>

577
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:16,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell us, girl!</font>

578
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:18,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo is the son of the driver who got into an accident...</font>

579
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:21,659
<font color=#FFFF00>while driving a van for Geumbit Academy 23 years ago.</font>

580
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:25,829
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

581
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:27,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

582
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:33,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you talking about the van I was in?</font>

583
00:32:37,459 --> 00:32:38,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

584
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, what's that about? I don't remember it.</font>

585
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

586
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I remember it.</font>

587
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I got this scar on my forehead...</font>

588
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:49,229
<font color=#FFFF00>because of that accident.</font>

589
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:51,359
<font color=#FFFF00>But what about that?</font>

590
00:32:52,989 --> 00:32:55,089
<font color=#FFFF00>The driver killed himself...</font>

591
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,629
<font color=#FFFF00>because of Uncle.</font>

592
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:00,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

593
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:03,129
<font color=#FFFF00>That's absurd.</font>

594
00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:04,559
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

595
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:07,259
<font color=#FFFF00>How does his suicide have to do with Dad?</font>

596
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:09,929
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

597
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,359
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

598
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Mal Ja once said...</font>

599
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,429
<font color=#FFFF00>that the driver's son came back to take his revenge.</font>

600
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:20,759
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right, Aunt.</font>

601
00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:22,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that Mr. Lee?</font>

602
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:27,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

603
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say revenge?</font>

604
00:33:31,459 --> 00:33:34,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom! Grandmother. Mom!</font>

605
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

606
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up, Mom! Mom!</font>

607
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is happening?</font>

608
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:42,589
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is going on?</font>

609
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:45,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake up, Mom. Mom.</font>

610
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:47,329
<font color=#FFFF00>- Bring water. - Bring water.</font>

611
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

612
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:54,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some drink?</font>

613
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that?</font>

614
00:33:56,529 --> 00:33:57,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Do what?</font>

615
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa, whom you call your sister...</font>

616
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,529
<font color=#FFFF00>tried to slap me in the face.</font>

617
00:34:05,289 --> 00:34:06,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asking why I didn't do anything to her?</font>

618
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:08,689
<font color=#FFFF00>Or...</font>

619
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,689
<font color=#FFFF00>are you asking why I didn't do anything to...</font>

620
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:13,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik, whom you call your brother,</font>

621
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:17,359
<font color=#FFFF00>when he tried to have a go at me?</font>

622
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Those people...</font>

623
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,129
<font color=#FFFF00>don't know anything.</font>

624
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Since what happened yesterday,</font>

625
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:30,129
<font color=#FFFF00>did you worry about me at all?</font>

626
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,989
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't get a wink of sleep.</font>

627
00:34:37,259 --> 00:34:39,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You ran into my house...</font>

628
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:42,289
<font color=#FFFF00>and ask me why I did that to them...</font>

629
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>instead of asking about the pain I've suffered from.</font>

630
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:48,989
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew...</font>

631
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,029
<font color=#FFFF00>things would turn out as Hyung Seop wanted.</font>

632
00:34:53,529 --> 00:34:56,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I know his sins cannot be forgiven by any means.</font>

633
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,829
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's not their fault.</font>

634
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:00,859
<font color=#FFFF00>They just sat back...</font>

635
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,029
<font color=#FFFF00>and received everything from their parents.</font>

636
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:06,399
<font color=#FFFF00>As they're driven into a corner,</font>

637
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,159
<font color=#FFFF00>they tried to rip off a wealthy guy...</font>

638
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,559
<font color=#FFFF00>living across the street only to ruin themselves.</font>

639
00:35:12,089 --> 00:35:13,459
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what they have done.</font>

640
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:16,159
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hyun Woo. - How could you yell...</font>

641
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:19,359
<font color=#FFFF00>and even swear at me as soon as you get here?</font>

642
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:22,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this ridiculous?</font>

643
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I to blame?</font>

644
00:35:28,289 --> 00:35:29,289
<font color=#FFFF00>No,</font>

645
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,359
<font color=#FFFF00>this is just the way the world is.</font>

646
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,159
<font color=#FFFF00>They should blame their parents who spoiled them.</font>

647
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:40,859
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why they still live with their fully-grown children...</font>

648
00:35:41,629 --> 00:35:43,489
<font color=#FFFF00>justifying themselves that that's what parents do.</font>

649
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:46,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I could become an independent person...</font>

650
00:35:48,029 --> 00:35:49,829
<font color=#FFFF00>because I lost my father when I was little.</font>

651
00:35:51,529 --> 00:35:54,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't make such sarcastic remarks.</font>

652
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you're no different from my dad.</font>

653
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop, Hyun Woo.</font>

654
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:03,759
<font color=#FFFF00>This is enough.</font>

655
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:09,329
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sang Woo. - Let me...</font>

656
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,559
<font color=#FFFF00>take care of the rest.</font>

657
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,689
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure...</font>

658
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,989
<font color=#FFFF00>no one gets hurt because of this.</font>

659
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:18,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll go to you.</font>

660
00:36:19,129 --> 00:36:20,159
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

661
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:22,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you can't do that.</font>

662
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:28,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been watching you for quite a long time.</font>

663
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:30,729
<font color=#FFFF00>You can never...</font>

664
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,689
<font color=#FFFF00>put an end to all this on your own.</font>

665
00:36:34,329 --> 00:36:36,829
<font color=#FFFF00>You're wrong. I can.</font>

666
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:38,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

667
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I can.</font>

668
00:36:43,989 --> 00:36:44,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

669
00:36:45,629 --> 00:36:47,229
<font color=#FFFF00>If you say so,</font>

670
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:49,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to move out right away.</font>

671
00:36:51,129 --> 00:36:53,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stop everything as you said.</font>

672
00:36:54,689 --> 00:36:57,059
<font color=#FFFF00>So disconnect all your ties with that family.</font>

673
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,729
<font color=#FFFF00>You know we have an appointment tomorrow, right?</font>

674
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,789
<font color=#FFFF00>The officials from the Golden Street headquarters are in Korea.</font>

675
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:09,689
<font color=#FFFF00>I want...</font>

676
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,029
<font color=#FFFF00>to show them my brother.</font>

677
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:14,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Come with me.</font>

678
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Make sure to dress up.</font>

679
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

680
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:28,559
<font color=#FFFF00>you're more good looking than me.</font>

681
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,759
<font color=#FFFF00>That makes me the happiest.</font>

682
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,059
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

683
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:23,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui?</font>

684
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,329
<font color=#FFFF00>You're back, Grandmother.</font>

685
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:28,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so absent-minded? How could you not notice me?</font>

686
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:30,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thinking about something.</font>

687
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you thinking about?</font>

688
00:38:34,989 --> 00:38:36,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have dinner?</font>

689
00:38:36,489 --> 00:38:38,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Not yet. What about you?</font>

690
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me make dinner for you.</font>

691
00:38:40,659 --> 00:38:43,259
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right. I'm not hungry now.</font>

692
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:46,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you have dinner?</font>

693
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:50,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You must not skip meals like that. You're still young.</font>

694
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I've had some snacks.</font>

695
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:55,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you cold?</font>

696
00:38:57,029 --> 00:38:58,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

697
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:01,989
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't really matter for old people like me.</font>

698
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say that.</font>

699
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:08,159
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you do today?</font>

700
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I did nothing special.</font>

701
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:13,589
<font color=#FFFF00>You stayed in all day long?</font>

702
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:16,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What else could I do?</font>

703
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You told me not to go outside.</font>

704
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Wasn't it hard to just stay in?</font>

705
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm all right.</font>

706
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,259
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't go many places when I lived in Seoul either.</font>

707
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:31,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I just went to work and came home every day.</font>

708
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:35,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'm relieved then.</font>

709
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:37,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad to hear that.</font>

710
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,489
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

711
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to ask you.</font>

712
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:45,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

713
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have to move this far?</font>

714
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:52,899
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wondered...</font>

715
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:56,759
<font color=#FFFF00>if there was some reason why we had to move to this remote town.</font>

716
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,229
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no reason.</font>

717
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:01,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted...</font>

718
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:04,089
<font color=#FFFF00>to lead a quiet life with you.</font>

719
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:06,689
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

720
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:10,559
<font color=#FFFF00>there's something I am curious about.</font>

721
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:16,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have any trouble with President Bang?</font>

722
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:21,129
<font color=#FFFF00>What... What on earth are you talking about?</font>

723
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:22,489
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by trouble?</font>

724
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I have any trouble with him?</font>

725
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:28,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget it.</font>

726
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought President Bang cared a lot about you,</font>

727
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,629
<font color=#FFFF00>but you didn't even call him before we moved here.</font>

728
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:36,259
<font color=#FFFF00>So I wondered if something happened.</font>

729
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:39,089
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just curious. That's it.</font>

730
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:41,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

731
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:45,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I also love living with you alone.</font>

732
00:40:45,929 --> 00:40:47,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I really mean it.</font>

733
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:21,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

734
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

735
00:41:26,429 --> 00:41:28,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you still up?</font>

736
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you ill?</font>

737
00:41:30,929 --> 00:41:32,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

738
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:34,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

739
00:41:36,189 --> 00:41:37,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I just can't fall asleep easily.</font>

740
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:41,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Old people all have trouble falling asleep. You'll know later.</font>

741
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:44,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you crying?</font>

742
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:48,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, a little.</font>

743
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:50,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

744
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:53,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Because I couldn't fall asleep.</font>

745
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:58,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I just couldn't help thinking about various things.</font>

746
00:42:00,529 --> 00:42:01,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother...</font>

747
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:09,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel bad for you.</font>

748
00:42:10,399 --> 00:42:12,529
<font color=#FFFF00>You're suffering a lot...</font>

749
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,229
<font color=#FFFF00>because I took you here with me.</font>

750
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:15,829
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I cried.</font>

751
00:42:16,329 --> 00:42:17,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

752
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:20,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I like it here.</font>

753
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:23,259
<font color=#FFFF00>It's quiet, so I can write the scripts better.</font>

754
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:26,729
<font color=#FFFF00>It's also comfortable to live with you alone.</font>

755
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:32,989
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not meant to suffer in this remote place.</font>

756
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

757
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,589
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have been...</font>

758
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:40,459
<font color=#FFFF00>raised in a wealthy family and received a lot of love.</font>

759
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:43,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have lived in a happy family.</font>

760
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:45,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going through a lot...</font>

761
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,229
<font color=#FFFF00>because of me.</font>

762
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:52,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

763
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:55,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

764
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:59,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I am really sorry.</font>

765
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I will pay a heavy price...</font>

766
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,129
<font color=#FFFF00>later.</font>

767
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:10,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here.</font>

768
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:14,059
<font color=#FFFF00>My Dong Hui.</font>

769
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,789
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor girl.</font>

770
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:19,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

771
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:22,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

772
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:28,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

773
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here so early today?</font>

774
00:43:34,259 --> 00:43:35,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo isn't here yet.</font>

775
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,189
<font color=#FFFF00>You know I left 10 minutes earlier last time.</font>

776
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:39,899
<font color=#FFFF00>So I came early today.</font>

777
00:43:40,399 --> 00:43:41,959
<font color=#FFFF00>This is for you.</font>

778
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you here to play around?</font>

779
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

780
00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:51,129
<font color=#FFFF00>This is where my romance is played.</font>

781
00:43:53,189 --> 00:43:55,229
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. That's lame.</font>

782
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:58,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll stay in my room. Leave when the lesson is over.</font>

783
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:01,829
<font color=#FFFF00>And I'll throw these flowers away when you leave.</font>

784
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's too rude...</font>

785
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:05,929
<font color=#FFFF00>to throw them away in front of you.</font>

786
00:44:09,989 --> 00:44:10,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Start the music.</font>

787
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:18,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Beautiful Dreamer,</font>

788
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:22,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Wake unto me</font>

789
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:25,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Starlight and dewdrops are</font>

790
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:27,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Waiting for thee</font>

791
00:44:29,089 --> 00:44:32,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds of the rude world</font>

792
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Past the sun</font>

793
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel empty inside</font>

794
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,559
<font color=#FFFF00>You are a cute pal in my dream</font>

795
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:51,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me</font>

796
00:44:51,329 --> 00:44:57,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to my beautiful song</font>

797
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom?</font>

798
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:03,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing's going on at your house, right?</font>

799
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing's going on.</font>

800
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:07,659
<font color=#FFFF00>What, Mom?</font>

801
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:10,459
<font color=#FFFF00>My ears are working fine. Why are you yelling at me?</font>

802
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:13,789
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? Is someone singing?</font>

803
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:15,829
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean... Mom.</font>

804
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:18,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I turned up the volume today.</font>

805
00:45:18,459 --> 00:45:20,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. That jerk.</font>

806
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,789
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what's up?</font>

807
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:24,789
<font color=#FFFF00>You know what?</font>

808
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out Mr. Lee across the street bullied our grandchildren.</font>

809
00:45:28,389 --> 00:45:29,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

810
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:32,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. What do you mean?</font>

811
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:38,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Please wake up</font>

812
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:40,329
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let her off easy this time.</font>

813
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:46,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Jeong Eun.</font>

814
00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:48,059
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

815
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:49,359
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this mess?</font>

816
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:50,759
<font color=#FFFF00>What mess?</font>

817
00:45:50,959 --> 00:45:53,029
<font color=#FFFF00>The man you used to date.</font>

818
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:54,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Lee Hyun Woo across the street.</font>

819
00:45:54,529 --> 00:45:56,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that he came back...</font>

820
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,329
<font color=#FFFF00>here to take revenge on your uncle?</font>

821
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:00,889
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not true. Mom.</font>

822
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:03,759
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's not, why did your grandmother call me to say this?</font>

823
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:05,259
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what happened.</font>

824
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:07,189
<font color=#FFFF00>He had his reasons.</font>

825
00:46:07,189 --> 00:46:09,659
<font color=#FFFF00>How can such a vicious guy have reasons?</font>

826
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:13,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why he approached you on purpose?</font>

827
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:16,189
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Mom. He didn't do anything wrong to me.</font>

828
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:18,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you see that he used you?</font>

829
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:21,259
<font color=#FFFF00>This is why he played you and then left you.</font>

830
00:46:21,259 --> 00:46:24,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of him, you cried day and night and suffered.</font>

831
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:26,359
<font color=#FFFF00>That is not how it happened, Mom.</font>

832
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:28,829
<font color=#FFFF00>You are pathetic.</font>

833
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:30,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Today will be the last day for both of us.</font>

834
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,329
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you?</font>

835
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:34,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't I tell you to be careful of men?</font>

836
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,759
<font color=#FFFF00>You learned what I told you not to learn...</font>

837
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:38,689
<font color=#FFFF00>and didn't learn what you should've learned.</font>

838
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:40,889
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to cut off all of your hair today.</font>

839
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:42,529
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey. Ae Ri. - Come here.</font>

840
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:44,529
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come here. - This is beneath you.</font>

841
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:45,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop hurting my daughter.</font>

842
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,429
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Your daughter? Did you say "my daughter"?</font>

843
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:50,389
<font color=#FFFF00>You resurfaced after 30 years.</font>

844
00:46:50,389 --> 00:46:53,359
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you pretend to be her father? Stay out of it.</font>

845
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:55,429
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom. - Today,</font>

846
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:57,359
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad, are you okay? - I'm going to...</font>

847
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not okay.</font>

848
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:01,629
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? You got zero?</font>

849
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:03,059
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you score zero?</font>

850
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:06,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo. I am scared.</font>

851
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:08,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In. Don't worry. I'm here.</font>

852
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think I know you did this on purpose?</font>

853
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,689
<font color=#FFFF00>There is not a day that goes by peacefully.</font>

854
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:22,089
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, Mom is feeling under the weather. What should I do?</font>

855
00:47:22,489 --> 00:47:25,489
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you? You had your fun.</font>

856
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:27,659
<font color=#FFFF00>It's time for you to pull yourself together and study.</font>

857
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:29,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you still rebelling?</font>

858
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,259
<font color=#FFFF00>So you should stop already!</font>

859
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:33,989
<font color=#FFFF00>I can study...</font>

860
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,129
<font color=#FFFF00>without you nagging me.</font>

861
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:37,429
<font color=#FFFF00>How can your rank drop like this...</font>

862
00:47:37,489 --> 00:47:39,389
<font color=#FFFF00>if you can study by yourself?</font>

863
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,129
<font color=#FFFF00>The result speaks for itself!</font>

864
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,589
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom said it would be enough for her...</font>

865
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:46,329
<font color=#FFFF00>as long as I am ranked within the 10th place.</font>

866
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:49,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me, Aunt?</font>

867
00:47:50,959 --> 00:47:52,259
<font color=#FFFF00>If you study just a bit,</font>

868
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:54,789
<font color=#FFFF00>you can be top of your class.</font>

869
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:57,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you satisfied with just a 10th place?</font>

870
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:01,859
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you realize anything from watching what happened to us?</font>

871
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you pass the bar exam, become a reporter,</font>

872
00:48:04,029 --> 00:48:05,529
<font color=#FFFF00>or graduate from the most prestigious university,</font>

873
00:48:05,689 --> 00:48:08,189
<font color=#FFFF00>it's nothing unless you are the best.</font>

874
00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:10,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you realize it after seeing what happened to our family?</font>

875
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:14,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt. That's all you see.</font>

876
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,459
<font color=#FFFF00>All of my parents studied hard.</font>

877
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:19,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you ever wondered...</font>

878
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:22,359
<font color=#FFFF00>if they are happy now?</font>

879
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:26,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Listen to yourself.</font>

880
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said we are not happy?</font>

881
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:32,089
<font color=#FFFF00>We are happy. We are very happy.</font>

882
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:36,829
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want to be happy like us, you can start by studying.</font>

883
00:48:37,729 --> 00:48:40,089
<font color=#FFFF00>If a smart boy like you doesn't study,</font>

884
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:41,889
<font color=#FFFF00>who would study?</font>

885
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:44,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Let's not give up. Please?</font>

886
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo. Take your mother away.</font>

887
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:50,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

888
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:51,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Please.</font>

889
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What are you doing?</font>

890
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:56,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you go to your lesson?</font>

891
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:58,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Escort her upstairs.</font>

892
00:48:58,729 --> 00:49:01,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go, Mom. You're not feeling good. Why don't you rest?</font>

893
00:49:01,929 --> 00:49:02,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

894
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:05,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me off. Put me down. Chang Soo.</font>

895
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:08,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. You can be happy.</font>

896
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:13,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

897
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,959
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like she will suffocate me to death.</font>

898
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,359
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't breathe.</font>

899
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:25,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

900
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,789
<font color=#FFFF00>It's really hard for me.</font>

901
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:31,929
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't live in this house.</font>

902
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:35,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

903
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:37,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Your former mother...</font>

904
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,429
<font color=#FFFF00>raised you for a long time.</font>

905
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:44,759
<font color=#FFFF00>She thinks you are still her son.</font>

906
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:48,029
<font color=#FFFF00>She hasn't regained her senses yet.</font>

907
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:50,689
<font color=#FFFF00>So Ji Hoon,</font>

908
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:53,789
<font color=#FFFF00>while you live here,</font>

909
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:57,059
<font color=#FFFF00>don't argue with her.</font>

910
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:00,429
<font color=#FFFF00>Just let her have her ways sometimes. Okay?</font>

911
00:50:01,659 --> 00:50:04,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Wait a bit more.</font>

912
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:07,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom and Dad are trying right now.</font>

913
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:10,129
<font color=#FFFF00>We are going to move out soon.</font>

914
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:12,089
<font color=#FFFF00>If she keeps at it,</font>

915
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:16,289
<font color=#FFFF00>there's no point for me to live in the basement giving up...</font>

916
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:18,259
<font color=#FFFF00>my room and comfortable life.</font>

917
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,229
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

918
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:22,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't come down because I wanted.</font>

919
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,189
<font color=#FFFF00>I came down here...</font>

920
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,429
<font color=#FFFF00>because living upstairs was a torture.</font>

921
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,129
<font color=#FFFF00>She even followed me here.</font>

922
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,289
<font color=#FFFF00>She's trying to kill me.</font>

923
00:50:37,129 --> 00:50:39,929
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

924
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,359
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean there's no point?</font>

925
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:47,859
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

926
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:52,329
<font color=#FFFF00>came down because of your biological mother and father.</font>

927
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever.</font>

928
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:03,459
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't sleep a wink last night.</font>

929
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:06,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think he's sly no matter how you look at this?</font>

930
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:09,629
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my point. I am dumbfounded. This is so shocking.</font>

931
00:51:09,629 --> 00:51:11,789
<font color=#FFFF00>I still don't feel at ease.</font>

932
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:13,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it.</font>

933
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:15,529
<font color=#FFFF00>He made a small scratch on my car,</font>

934
00:51:15,529 --> 00:51:18,029
<font color=#FFFF00>but he lent me an expensive car.</font>

935
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:20,489
<font color=#FFFF00>He let me rent an office at a low rate.</font>

936
00:51:20,759 --> 00:51:23,859
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I have thought that he did those out of kindness?</font>

937
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have... Mom. Look.</font>

938
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have goosebumps.</font>

939
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,159
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he do this with such a gentle face?</font>

940
00:51:35,389 --> 00:51:36,789
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

941
00:51:37,059 --> 00:51:40,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I still remember the day he moved into the neighborhood.</font>

942
00:51:41,189 --> 00:51:43,959
<font color=#FFFF00>The thought of it makes me shiver.</font>

943
00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:45,759
<font color=#FFFF00>He treated us so well.</font>

944
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:47,489
<font color=#FFFF00>We treated him just as well as he did.</font>

945
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:49,929
<font color=#FFFF00>But how could he have...</font>

946
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:51,529
<font color=#FFFF00>such a vicious ulterior motive...</font>

947
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:53,359
<font color=#FFFF00>and befriend us?</font>

948
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,729
<font color=#FFFF00>The thought of it gives me goosebumps.</font>

949
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:57,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Crazy jerk.</font>

950
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:00,659
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a psychopath. He's out of his mind.</font>

951
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:03,029
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

952
00:52:03,159 --> 00:52:04,729
<font color=#FFFF00>It's true.</font>

953
00:52:04,729 --> 00:52:07,959
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, how can his father's suicide be your fault?</font>

954
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,289
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he commit suicide leaving his children behind?</font>

955
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:12,459
<font color=#FFFF00>He should have raised them after paying for what he did.</font>

956
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:15,689
<font color=#FFFF00>If I were him, I wouldn't be able to get rid of my daughter's face...</font>

957
00:52:15,689 --> 00:52:17,289
<font color=#FFFF00>until the moment I died.</font>

958
00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:18,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

959
00:52:19,629 --> 00:52:21,829
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all my fault.</font>

960
00:52:22,029 --> 00:52:24,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it your fault?</font>

961
00:52:24,629 --> 00:52:26,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you kill that bus driver?</font>

962
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:28,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you help him hang himself?</font>

963
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:30,159
<font color=#FFFF00>Or did you hold him up to hang himself?</font>

964
00:52:30,829 --> 00:52:32,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

965
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:35,529
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm pointing out the facts. At that time, a lot of children were hurt.</font>

966
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:37,489
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa almost died from the accident.</font>

967
00:52:37,689 --> 00:52:40,559
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you have stayed on the sideline when she was about to die?</font>

968
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:43,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, he drove under the influence.</font>

969
00:52:44,189 --> 00:52:46,389
<font color=#FFFF00>You just called him an alcoholic because he was one.</font>

970
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:50,089
<font color=#FFFF00>You filed a report to the police. You didn't do anything wrong.</font>

971
00:52:50,929 --> 00:52:53,529
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why he committed suicide?</font>

972
00:52:56,389 --> 00:52:59,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. It is a sad story indeed.</font>

973
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:02,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother. It has nothing to do with us.</font>

974
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Drinking and driving is a habit for people like him.</font>

975
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:07,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he didn't get caught that time,</font>

976
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:09,289
<font color=#FFFF00>he would have definitely driven after drinking.</font>

977
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Then other children might have been hurt too.</font>

978
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:14,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough is enough.</font>

979
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:16,429
<font color=#FFFF00>You, stay out of it.</font>

980
00:53:17,189 --> 00:53:18,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this why...</font>

981
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:22,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee grabbed you by the collar?</font>

982
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:26,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun should have kept her mouth shut.</font>

983
00:53:26,629 --> 00:53:28,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe her too.</font>

984
00:53:28,129 --> 00:53:30,329
<font color=#FFFF00>If she knew about this, she should've told us sooner.</font>

985
00:53:30,329 --> 00:53:32,789
<font color=#FFFF00>How can she keep this a secret from us?</font>

986
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:35,029
<font color=#FFFF00>What if Mr. Lee did manage to ruin our family?</font>

987
00:53:35,029 --> 00:53:36,359
<font color=#FFFF00>What would she have done then?</font>

988
00:53:36,389 --> 00:53:38,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. She's ridiculous.</font>

989
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,159
<font color=#FFFF00>She'd better not show her face here.</font>

990
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:42,889
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's ban her from coming into our house.</font>

991
00:53:43,129 --> 00:53:45,259
<font color=#FFFF00>Can all of you stay quiet?</font>

992
00:53:45,259 --> 00:53:47,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take care of it.</font>

993
00:53:47,029 --> 00:53:49,259
<font color=#FFFF00>How will you take care of this?</font>

994
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:53,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Why are you acting like this?</font>

995
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:56,329
<font color=#FFFF00>On whose side are you?</font>

996
00:53:56,729 --> 00:54:01,089
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What does he plan to do?</font>

997
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,589
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear.</font>

998
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,129
<font color=#FFFF00>How does Seong Joon fit into this?</font>

999
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:06,889
<font color=#FFFF00>What about him?</font>

1000
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:09,859
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

1001
00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:12,089
<font color=#FFFF00>it seemed like he's visiting Mr. Lee quite often recently.</font>

1002
00:54:12,189 --> 00:54:14,559
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering if Seong Joon was affected by this in any way.</font>

1003
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:17,689
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Even Seong Joon?</font>

1004
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:22,059
<font color=#FFFF00>(Inbox)</font>

1005
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>

1006
00:54:26,359 --> 00:54:28,629
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you waiting for my emails?</font>

1007
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:31,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I didn't send you an email.</font>

1008
00:54:32,489 --> 00:54:34,589
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a problem now.</font>

1009
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it is about my grandmother,</font>

1010
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:39,229
<font color=#FFFF00>but I know nothing about it.</font>

1011
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:40,929
<font color=#FFFF00>And I can't ask her anything.</font>

1012
00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:44,789
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you were coming this weekend. I will wait for you.</font>

1013
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:47,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I will tell you everything then.</font>

1014
00:54:47,729 --> 00:54:49,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I have three days left until the weekend.</font>

1015
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:51,129
<font color=#FFFF00>I miss you.</font>

1016
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:01,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Oh Dong Hui?</font>

1017
00:55:02,929 --> 00:55:03,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

1018
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:05,859
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1019
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:10,929
<font color=#FFFF00>- We got it. - Let's go.</font>

1020
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:12,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me? What are you doing?</font>

1021
00:55:13,429 --> 00:55:16,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me.</font>

1022
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:50,389
<font color=#FFFF00>- You are here. - Yes, sir.</font>

1023
00:55:53,429 --> 00:55:55,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You look good today.</font>

1024
00:55:55,929 --> 00:55:57,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Today is an important day for you.</font>

1025
00:55:58,429 --> 00:56:00,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Above all things,</font>

1026
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:02,729
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to cause any harm to you and your brother.</font>

1027
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:05,589
<font color=#FFFF00>So I dressed up.</font>

1028
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:10,489
<font color=#FFFF00>That's very thoughtful of you.</font>

1029
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:13,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Where's Sang Woo?</font>

1030
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:17,159
<font color=#FFFF00>I will meet him in front of my house at seven o'clock.</font>

1031
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:18,589
<font color=#FFFF00>That's good to know.</font>

1032
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope it will be...</font>

1033
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:23,289
<font color=#FFFF00>a meaningful day for you two.</font>

1034
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:25,229
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope so too.</font>

1035
00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:29,689
<font color=#FFFF00>People must be curious...</font>

1036
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:31,129
<font color=#FFFF00>about David Lee's brother.</font>

1037
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:32,889
<font color=#FFFF00>You bet.</font>

1038
00:56:33,129 --> 00:56:35,389
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't be afraid of anything...</font>

1039
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:37,159
<font color=#FFFF00>even in New York...</font>

1040
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,489
<font color=#FFFF00>as long as you have Sang Woo with you.</font>

1041
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:43,229
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you need a brother.</font>

1042
00:56:45,189 --> 00:56:48,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess that's why my father left him to me.</font>

1043
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:50,329
<font color=#FFFF00>So that I won't be lonely...</font>

1044
00:56:51,129 --> 00:56:53,629
<font color=#FFFF00>and live alone in this rough world.</font>

1045
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:58,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Congratulations on the party.</font>

1046
00:57:00,189 --> 00:57:01,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

1047
00:57:02,729 --> 00:57:04,889
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that?</font>

1048
00:57:06,829 --> 00:57:08,029
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you find it out?</font>

1049
00:57:09,189 --> 00:57:11,029
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out even before Seong Joon.</font>

1050
00:57:11,459 --> 00:57:13,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it when I went to see Mal Ja.</font>

1051
00:57:14,859 --> 00:57:17,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you told me to go see Mal Ja?</font>

1052
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,429
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

1053
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:27,159
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've been through a lot of heartaches.</font>

1054
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:29,059
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

1055
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:32,329
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon said he'd take care of it.</font>

1056
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:33,729
<font color=#FFFF00>Please give him a chance.</font>

1057
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:38,789
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sorry for him. He must be miserable.</font>

1058
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:41,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle.</font>

1059
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:45,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Does your family have hard feelings toward Hyun Woo?</font>

1060
00:57:47,689 --> 00:57:49,359
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all my fault.</font>

1061
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:51,459
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle.</font>

1062
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:55,489
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it wouldn't make any difference even if I tell you this.</font>

1063
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:57,759
<font color=#FFFF00>But I have to tell you this.</font>

1064
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:03,389
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to tell you this though.</font>

1065
00:58:04,129 --> 00:58:05,629
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you've lived...</font>

1066
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:07,659
<font color=#FFFF00>with guilt all your life.</font>

1067
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:11,529
<font color=#FFFF00>If I can't help you, I don't want to give you a hard time at least.</font>

1068
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,459
<font color=#FFFF00>But now that your family found it out,</font>

1069
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:17,389
<font color=#FFFF00>you should know the truth.</font>

1070
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,929
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop beating around the bush and just tell me.</font>

1071
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:24,589
<font color=#FFFF00>The van incident.</font>

1072
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:26,789
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact,</font>

1073
00:58:26,959 --> 00:58:30,059
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja was going to give some money and reach an agreement.</font>

1074
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:32,859
<font color=#FFFF00>But you kept insisting...</font>

1075
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:35,729
<font color=#FFFF00>he was a drunkard and tried to call the police.</font>

1076
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:38,089
<font color=#FFFF00>She were afraid of getting caught,</font>

1077
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:40,659
<font color=#FFFF00>so she brought...</font>

1078
00:58:40,689 --> 00:58:42,959
<font color=#FFFF00>a false charge against Hyun Woo's father with Mal Ja...</font>

1079
00:58:44,129 --> 00:58:45,929
<font color=#FFFF00>to save her face.</font>

1080
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,459
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

1081
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:52,759
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo's father...</font>

1082
00:58:53,389 --> 00:58:55,359
<font color=#FFFF00>was not drunk.</font>

1083
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,129
<font color=#FFFF00>He already quit drinking.</font>

1084
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:01,989
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't even touch a drop of alcohol that day.</font>

1085
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:06,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle. You got the wrong person.</font>

1086
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:09,859
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1087
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:15,689
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what's taking her so long.</font>

1088
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,289
<font color=#FFFF00>And what's wrong with you?</font>

1089
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:22,289
<font color=#FFFF00>I will talk to Jeong Eun once she comes out of the room.</font>

1090
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:25,989
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle, what's wrong? Wake up.</font>

1091
00:59:26,929 --> 00:59:29,129
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's going on? - I don't know.</font>

1092
00:59:29,459 --> 00:59:31,189
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt! Grandmother!</font>

1093
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:35,659
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt! Grandmother! Please come here.</font>

1094
00:59:35,759 --> 00:59:37,429

1095
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:39,389
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, what's wrong?</font>

1096
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:41,789
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on? Honey!</font>

1097
00:59:41,789 --> 00:59:43,259
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with him?</font>

1098
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,359
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon! Grandmother!</font>

1099
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:46,059
<font color=#FFFF00>We should take him to the hospital.</font>

1100
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:47,559
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with him? - Dad.</font>

1101
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:50,189
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad, wake up. - Hurry.</font>

1102
00:59:50,229 --> 00:59:52,189
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - Hurry.</font>

1103
00:59:52,229 --> 00:59:53,789
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with him? - What should we do?</font>

1104
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,489
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

1105
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,129
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo must be running a little late, sir.</font>

1106
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:15,059
<font color=#FFFF00>He'll come soon.</font>

1107
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:21,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, where's your car?</font>

1108
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:23,989
<font color=#FFFF00>It's down the street.</font>

1109
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:26,389
<font color=#FFFF00>That's too far.</font>

1110
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:33,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

1111
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,189
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

1112
01:00:40,259 --> 01:00:41,559
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you forget our plan?</font>

1113
01:00:43,559 --> 01:00:46,229
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo, Dad is sick.</font>

1114
01:00:56,229 --> 01:00:58,829
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo, I'm sorry. I will talk to you later.</font>

1115
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:32,759
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, we have a problem.</font>

1121

1122
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:09,959
<font color=#FFFF00>Where should I go? Which way?</font>

1123
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,629
