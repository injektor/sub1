00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:31,573
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 28)</font>

2
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:47,705
<font color=#FFFF00>How about Seong Joon?</font>

3
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,055
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. He hasn't woken up yet.</font>

4
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:51,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

5
00:00:51,355 --> 00:00:54,625
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will go check on him. - No, I will go.</font>

6
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:01,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

7
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:03,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

8
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:05,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

9
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:08,355
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? You didn't answer when I called you.</font>

10
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,625
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you thinking so hard about that you didn't hear me?</font>

11
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:13,925
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

12
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,155
<font color=#FFFF00>You are sweating a lot. Are you sick?</font>

13
00:01:20,085 --> 00:01:21,085
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I am fine.</font>

14
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.</font>

15
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,755
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not sick. I'm fine, Father.</font>

16
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you certain?</font>

17
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:28,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course I am.</font>

18
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out and have breakfast. Mom's worried about you.</font>

19
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,455
<font color=#FFFF00>- All right. - Come out quickly.</font>

20
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:34,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

21
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:53,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Seong Hoon.</font>

22
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:56,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. Get the morning paper. Get the paper.</font>

23
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,385
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

24
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:00,625
<font color=#FFFF00>We have already located Attorney Han Seong Sik.</font>

25
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I understand.</font>

26
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:05,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Get the newspaper so that Father doesn't read it.</font>

27
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:08,255
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

28
00:02:09,625 --> 00:02:12,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone's calling me. I'll talk to you later.</font>

29
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:17,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Reporter Yim. What happened?</font>

30
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have breakfast?</font>

31
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,025
<font color=#FFFF00>I am about to have it.</font>

32
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:24,155
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you have breakfast? - Yes, I had some bread.</font>

33
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:27,595
<font color=#FFFF00>I came downstairs to have some coffee.</font>

34
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,925
<font color=#FFFF00>You could drink your coffee while we have our breakfast.</font>

35
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess I can do that. Here's the newspaper.</font>

36
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,685
<font color=#FFFF00>I always tell them to deliver well,</font>

37
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:36,325
<font color=#FFFF00>but they sloppily throw it.</font>

38
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

39
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:39,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you go to work yet?</font>

40
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,095
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get going soon.</font>

41
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:44,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Ae. Give me a cup of coffee, please.</font>

42
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,585
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Come.</font>

43
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:48,385
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

44
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:57,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you reading the paper in the middle of your breakfast?</font>

45
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,655
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right. It's distracting. Put it away.</font>

46
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

47
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,925
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

48
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:08,355
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

49
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this Seong Hoon in the picture?</font>

50
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,225
<font color=#FFFF00>What is going on?</font>

51
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:18,155
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Isn't this Seong Hoon?</font>

52
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,525
<font color=#FFFF00>That's Seong Sik next to him.</font>

53
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:23,885
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why are they in the picture? - What on earth is going on?</font>

54
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are both of my grandchildren in the newspaper?</font>

55
00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:29,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. Please calm down. Let me read what this is about.</font>

56
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:34,655
<font color=#FFFF00>"Popular attorney who was involved in the collusion..."</font>

57
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,185
<font color=#FFFF00>"of Minjeong Party and Seonghan Group..."</font>

58
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:39,555
<font color=#FFFF00>"is revealed to be ex-presenter, Han Seong Sik."</font>

59
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,355
<font color=#FFFF00>"He is scheduled to be questioned by the prosecution."</font>

60
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:44,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

61
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Seong Joon.</font>

62
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:50,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What is all this? Were you aware of this?</font>

63
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:52,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

64
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:54,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I just got a call from Seong Hoon.</font>

65
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,155
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did he say? - What did he say?</font>

66
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

67
00:03:58,485 --> 00:03:59,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

68
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are Seong Hoon and Seong Sik? Are they home?</font>

69
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

70
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,925
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong? - Mother.</font>

71
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:08,055
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Ae. - Honey.</font>

72
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,585
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness. Hey. - Mother.</font>

73
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,555
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother. - Jeong Ae. Hold on.</font>

74
00:04:13,555 --> 00:04:16,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get her to her room quickly. What are we going to do?</font>

75
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:20,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she going to be okay?</font>

76
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey. Are you all right?</font>

77
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:25,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Ae. My goodness. What's wrong? Jeong Ae!</font>

78
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:29,555
<font color=#FFFF00>So where are you? I asked where you are!</font>

79
00:04:29,955 --> 00:04:32,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you think I am? I am in the office.</font>

80
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I am with Seong Hoon.</font>

81
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Reporters are camped outside the office,</font>

82
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,425
<font color=#FFFF00>so I can't leave.</font>

83
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

84
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,395
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sincerely sorry.</font>

85
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:57,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

86
00:04:57,985 --> 00:04:59,395
<font color=#FFFF00>But Honey,</font>

87
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,755
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so dirty.</font>

88
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:07,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you bring me new underwear?</font>

89
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:08,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you jerk.</font>

90
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:12,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to change your underwear at this very moment?</font>

91
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:16,085
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to hit me though.</font>

92
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:20,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I am a human being. I am entitled to have clean underwear.</font>

93
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand you, jerk.</font>

94
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you...</font>

95
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:27,655
<font color=#FFFF00>not get involved with Seonghan Group and Minjeong Party.</font>

96
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:28,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

97
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:32,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't hit me. Whatever you do, don't hit me.</font>

98
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You never listen to me.</font>

99
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,725
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do with all those reporters?</font>

100
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:41,025
<font color=#FFFF00>How are you going to handle the investigation by the prosecution?</font>

101
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

102
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:45,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't bring up such a thing.</font>

103
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:46,525
<font color=#FFFF00>An investigation by the prosecution...</font>

104
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I am really terrified.</font>

105
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,625
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hold on. - Hey.</font>

106
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook. What are we going to do with this mess?</font>

107
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should go to the office.</font>

108
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,685
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you? There is a gang of reporters there.</font>

109
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:04,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find a way. Hye Joo.</font>

110
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:06,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Please look after the children. I'm going now.</font>

111
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:09,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook. Hee Sook!</font>

112
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

113
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:15,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Seong Sik. I knew this would happen when he got into politics.</font>

114
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. What's going on?</font>

115
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:19,255
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father. - Where's Hee Sook?</font>

116
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,525
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this all about?</font>

117
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:25,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook just went out to see Seong Sik.</font>

118
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:27,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it all true what the article said about him? Is it true?</font>

119
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:28,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

120
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:30,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon said it probably is.</font>

121
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:34,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. How are we going to handle this?</font>

122
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

123
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In.</font>

124
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:43,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this nonsense out of the blue?</font>

125
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop being upset.</font>

126
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:48,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so upset that I can't live.</font>

127
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:50,055
<font color=#FFFF00>How are we going to manage this?</font>

128
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:52,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down. Children are here.</font>

129
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go upstairs.</font>

130
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:54,655
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness, Seong Sik.</font>

131
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:00,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. What is going on?</font>

132
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:02,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. It's nothing.</font>

133
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why is Great-Grandmother crying?</font>

134
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Trust me. It's nothing.</font>

135
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:11,725
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Shouldn't you get ready for school?</font>

136
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take you to school today. Get ready now. Hurry.</font>

137
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,725
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hurry. - Okay.</font>

138
00:07:20,755 --> 00:07:22,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. What am I going to do?</font>

139
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,755
<font color=#FFFF00>How are we going to survive this?</font>

140
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Father.</font>

141
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:32,625
<font color=#FFFF00>You can put Ah In on the yellow bus from the preschool.</font>

142
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:35,525
<font color=#FFFF00>The same bus will drop her off. You can just pick her up there.</font>

143
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Father. Thank you.</font>

144
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on. What is this smell?</font>

145
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Did one of you put on your father's toner?</font>

146
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:56,325
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

147
00:07:56,525 --> 00:07:57,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you put on your father's toner?</font>

148
00:07:58,155 --> 00:07:59,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I did. What's wrong with it?</font>

149
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:03,985
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand smelling both of your hair product and the toner.</font>

150
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't open the window.</font>

151
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:08,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Cold wind will be damaging for my throat.</font>

152
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

153
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:12,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother told me to be careful of the cold.</font>

154
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,485
<font color=#FFFF00>She said opera singers' greatest asset is their body.</font>

155
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,985
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

156
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:19,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Han Chang Soo.</font>

157
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:23,385
<font color=#FFFF00>I do want to congratulate you for working hard to be an opera singer.</font>

158
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:26,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Enough is enough.</font>

159
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:30,325
<font color=#FFFF00>You pooped your pants recently.</font>

160
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:32,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt!</font>

161
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:36,585
<font color=#FFFF00>- You scared me. - Stop talking about my past.</font>

162
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:39,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm no longer who I used to be.</font>

163
00:08:39,355 --> 00:08:40,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

164
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:44,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Just live as you please.</font>

165
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,185
<font color=#FFFF00>- Here it is. - What is this?</font>

166
00:08:57,255 --> 00:08:59,855
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a list of Germany and Italian song books I need.</font>

167
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,755
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom went to buy them, but they were sold out.</font>

168
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,995
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure you'll be able to find them at the bookstore today.</font>

169
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no time to go buy these. Why don't you buy yourself?</font>

170
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,425
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a lesson right after school.</font>

171
00:09:10,495 --> 00:09:13,285
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Please buy them for me. See you.</font>

172
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Chang Soo!</font>

173
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:20,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm super busy today. Goodness.</font>

174
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:26,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, what are you doing? Get off.</font>

175
00:09:26,385 --> 00:09:27,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you not going to school?</font>

176
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, will we not going to move out?</font>

177
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:34,225
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Why are you talking about it out of the blue?</font>

178
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:37,585
<font color=#FFFF00>You know why. We live in the same house as Chang Soo,</font>

179
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:40,925
<font color=#FFFF00>so my former mom still meddles in my life.</font>

180
00:09:42,385 --> 00:09:45,785
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ji Hoon. - I really want to move out.</font>

181
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Now there's no point in having a new mom after all.</font>

182
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:55,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, I've also been troubled with that matter.</font>

183
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:58,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Please find a way to move out as soon as possible...</font>

184
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:01,825
<font color=#FFFF00>or I'll suffocate to death.</font>

185
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:05,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Darn it.</font>

186
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,855
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Did he say, "Darn it"? Fine. Darn it.</font>

187
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:12,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, wait for me.</font>

188
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,925
<font color=#FFFF00>He's also a little kid...</font>

189
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,025
<font color=#FFFF00>who doesn't know how hard his parents work.</font>

190
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,055
<font color=#FFFF00>This is driving me crazy.</font>

191
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:34,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, my back aches.</font>

192
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:44,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Do you have something to talk to me about?</font>

193
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:46,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

194
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to know who I am?</font>

195
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:52,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I work at the tea house,</font>

196
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, at the cafe...</font>

197
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,655
<font color=#FFFF00>on the second floor.</font>

198
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Madam Jeong. Why?</font>

199
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:02,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

200
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:10,455
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just back from a trip. And what's all this fuss about?</font>

201
00:11:10,585 --> 00:11:14,185
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to open the cafe from today. Why are you so crowded here?</font>

202
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you...</font>

203
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,855
<font color=#FFFF00>have a cup of coffee?</font>

204
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:22,285
<font color=#FFFF00>No thanks.</font>

205
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Fine.</font>

206
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:32,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Move.</font>

207
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:43,555
<font color=#FFFF00>It was dangerous. It is because of my foolish husband.</font>

208
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:52,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim,</font>

209
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:56,725
<font color=#FFFF00>please count me out this.</font>

210
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,425
<font color=#FFFF00>I gave you the advice personally...</font>

211
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,685
<font color=#FFFF00>without expecting anything in return.</font>

212
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:06,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do newspapers say it was an advice on tax evasion?</font>

213
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,155
<font color=#FFFF00>How pathetic.</font>

214
00:12:09,185 --> 00:12:10,425
<font color=#FFFF00>I know...</font>

215
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:14,155
<font color=#FFFF00>the collusion between Minjeong Party and Seonghan has been revealed,</font>

216
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,285
<font color=#FFFF00>but I have no idea why I am involved in that.</font>

217
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:21,485
<font color=#FFFF00>I have been nominated because they found me competent.</font>

218
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:25,125
<font color=#FFFF00>It has nothing to do with the advice.</font>

219
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:26,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Am I wrong?</font>

220
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:27,825
<font color=#FFFF00>How silly.</font>

221
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:34,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I will stay in my office and avoid the reporters.</font>

222
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:38,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Please handle this well and save me.</font>

223
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

224
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:45,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I will not go outside for a week.</font>

225
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:49,755
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. Please call me. Goodbye.</font>

226
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon,</font>

227
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim said he'll take care of this.</font>

228
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:02,025
<font color=#FFFF00>He just wants me to stay in...</font>

229
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:03,955
<font color=#FFFF00>and not see any reporters.</font>

230
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Staying inside won't settle anything.</font>

231
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Senior Secretary Kim will resolve the situation.</font>

232
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure he's also in trouble like you.</font>

233
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:17,725
<font color=#FFFF00>He is very...</font>

234
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,755
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who... Who is it? - It's me.</font>

235
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,785
<font color=#FFFF00>This is your wife.</font>

236
00:13:28,925 --> 00:13:30,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

237
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:34,825
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey, I missed you. - Hello, Hee Sook.</font>

238
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:38,555
<font color=#FFFF00>You're totally useless!</font>

239
00:13:39,725 --> 00:13:42,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to enter the political arena.</font>

240
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:46,325
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey. - What will you do now?</font>

241
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me what your plan is.</font>

242
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:51,055
<font color=#FFFF00>If you lose your title as a lawyer because of this,</font>

243
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:54,185
<font color=#FFFF00>how will we make a living? Tell me!</font>

244
00:13:54,325 --> 00:13:55,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it!</font>

245
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,785
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be all right!</font>

246
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,585
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be settled soon!</font>

247
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:05,385
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to just work hard as a lawyer.</font>

248
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you meddle...</font>

249
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:10,885
<font color=#FFFF00>in broadcasting and politics? Why did you overstep your bounds?</font>

250
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,625
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is terrible. - Stop.</font>

251
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook,</font>

252
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,455
<font color=#FFFF00>do you want some ramyeon?</font>

253
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon gave this pot to every one of the mountaineering club,</font>

254
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:23,925
<font color=#FFFF00>and this is highly likely to be considered a bribe.</font>

255
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:27,855
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why you... - This is unbelievable.</font>

256
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:30,385
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's all done! - Honey...</font>

257
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:32,755
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's get divorced. - Honey.</font>

258
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,825
<font color=#FFFF00>We should get divorced.</font>

259
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,085
<font color=#FFFF00>So tell us honestly now!</font>

260
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:42,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get anything in return for raising illegal fund for Seonghan?</font>

261
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:46,125
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't. I'm not lying.</font>

262
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, how were you nominated by the Party's members?</font>

263
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:52,325
<font color=#FFFF00>They voted for me only because I'm competent...</font>

264
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:56,125
<font color=#FFFF00>and popular among the public.</font>

265
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:57,925
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still out of your mind.</font>

266
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:01,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop hitting me!</font>

267
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:05,025
<font color=#FFFF00>It hurts! It hurts so bad!</font>

268
00:15:05,025 --> 00:15:08,825
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a possibility for you to be arrested...</font>

269
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:11,325
<font color=#FFFF00>along with the officials of Minjeong Party and Seonghan Group.</font>

270
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true, Seong Hoon?</font>

271
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:16,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me the truth.</font>

272
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,525
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you ask them for help? - Well...</font>

273
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,155
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about my brother.</font>

274
00:15:27,955 --> 00:15:30,755
<font color=#FFFF00>He runs a semiconductor manufacturer,</font>

275
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,455
<font color=#FFFF00>and he wants to work with Seonghan again.</font>

276
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

277
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:38,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if you can help him resume the trade with Seonghan.</font>

278
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:41,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

279
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:46,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't. There's nothing like that at all.</font>

280
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:47,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

281
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:51,055
<font color=#FFFF00>I am.</font>

282
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:55,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. You neither asked them for anything nor received anything.</font>

283
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

284
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,585
<font color=#FFFF00>- Exactly. - Don't be ridiculous.</font>

285
00:16:01,885 --> 00:16:05,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it hurts so much. Darn it</font>

286
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:07,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, why are you hiding now?</font>

287
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:13,455
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's just for... - Tell us already!</font>

288
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:17,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure? Are you really innocent?</font>

289
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:21,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I am! I am really innocent!</font>

290
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:26,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you hit the same spot? It aches a lot.</font>

291
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:29,985
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad, it's me. - What is it?</font>

292
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:33,825
<font color=#FFFF00>How is Mom?</font>

293
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,925
<font color=#FFFF00>She's the same.</font>

294
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,055
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm relieved since Seong Hoon...</font>

295
00:16:39,225 --> 00:16:42,155
<font color=#FFFF00>and Hee Sook are with Seong Sik in his office now.</font>

296
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,485
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'm still worried about how things will turn out.</font>

297
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:49,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry too much. Seong Sik is an honest person.</font>

298
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,025
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be all right, Dad.</font>

299
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,355
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you feel better now? - Sorry?</font>

300
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:58,055
<font color=#FFFF00>You were sweating this morning. Are you okay?</font>

301
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:00,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

302
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Come home early. I'll make you invigorating tea.</font>

303
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

304
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,355
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to protect your dad.</font>

305
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:31,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What did he do to him?</font>

306
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really not remember anything?</font>

307
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,155
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it that you want to say?</font>

308
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad...</font>

309
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:44,655
<font color=#FFFF00>is not your biological dad.</font>

310
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,425
<font color=#FFFF00>He told the orphanage that he is your biological father.</font>

311
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,025
<font color=#FFFF00>But he is not.</font>

312
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:54,785
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a silly man.</font>

313
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,885
<font color=#FFFF00>He fooled you completely.</font>

314
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:02,655
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you needed to believe that you were related to one of them.</font>

315
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:05,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, you would've endured your time there.</font>

316
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:07,885
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

317
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,755
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

318
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:12,695
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you one more thing.</font>

319
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,985
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't admire your father so much.</font>

320
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:22,695
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not so admirable after all.</font>

321
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,085
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it, Director Bang?</font>

322
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:43,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Please come in, Director Han.</font>

323
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,055
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. - Hi.</font>

324
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:49,955
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

325
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Please sit down, Director Han.</font>

326
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:54,855
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee came to discuss a few things with us. Please sit.</font>

327
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:57,085
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

328
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,225
<font color=#FFFF00>You...</font>

329
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,455
<font color=#FFFF00>want to include a secret behind the character's birth?</font>

330
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Will it be a problem?</font>

331
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:16,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Many Korean viewers like a plot with a secret behind someone's birth.</font>

332
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Some may think it is out-dated,</font>

333
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:24,585
<font color=#FFFF00>but we can't deny the fact that they do like it when it's in the plot.</font>

334
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:28,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, in order to export this to every country in Asia,</font>

335
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,425
<font color=#FFFF00>this plot twist is an essential factor.</font>

336
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so, Director Bang?</font>

337
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:37,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I agree with your assessment.</font>

338
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,285
<font color=#FFFF00>However,</font>

339
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:41,885
<font color=#FFFF00>this may be a bit over the line.</font>

340
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:47,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Over the line?</font>

341
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I believe so.</font>

342
00:19:52,285 --> 00:19:54,125
<font color=#FFFF00>As you know, the genre of our drama is...</font>

343
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,055
<font color=#FFFF00>romantic comedy.</font>

344
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,255
<font color=#FFFF00>I am fully aware of that.</font>

345
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:01,885
<font color=#FFFF00>However, this isn't an unreasonable demand.</font>

346
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,885
<font color=#FFFF00>You can change the plot slightly.</font>

347
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:06,585
<font color=#FFFF00>There are some things that...</font>

348
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,255
<font color=#FFFF00>we can not give up on our end for the quality of the drama.</font>

349
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,285
<font color=#FFFF00>If we ask the writer to do such a thing,</font>

350
00:20:12,385 --> 00:20:13,855
<font color=#FFFF00>you will put the writer in confusion.</font>

351
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,255
<font color=#FFFF00>The whole storyline might go wrong.</font>

352
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:20,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I personally believe a talented producer...</font>

353
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:22,625
<font color=#FFFF00>creates the highest profits...</font>

354
00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,625
<font color=#FFFF00>without changing the writer's intention.</font>

355
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't patronize me.</font>

356
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:37,655
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon? - President Lee. What he meant...</font>

357
00:20:37,825 --> 00:20:39,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not trying to patronize you.</font>

358
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:43,525
<font color=#FFFF00>In producing dramas, we have the upper hand from you.</font>

359
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:46,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I meant you would trust us regarding the production of the drama.</font>

360
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,195
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand where you are coming from.</font>

361
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:53,985
<font color=#FFFF00>However, right now you are not making any profits.</font>

362
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:56,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it better to make profits...</font>

363
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:58,855
<font color=#FFFF00>by all means for your team...</font>

364
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:01,885
<font color=#FFFF00>and for an investor like myself?</font>

365
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:07,195
<font color=#FFFF00>Please add in a secret behind the character's birth...</font>

366
00:21:07,695 --> 00:21:10,255
<font color=#FFFF00>or I will personally meet the writer.</font>

367
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,485
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee.</font>

368
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to us?</font>

369
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:35,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand what you mean.</font>

370
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:38,225
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you would trust and leave it to us.</font>

371
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

372
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,785
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I have invested in the production.</font>

373
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:46,055
<font color=#FFFF00>However, once I start investing the money,</font>

374
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I tend to worry in advance.</font>

375
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,155
<font color=#FFFF00>- But still. - Do you think I am interfering?</font>

376
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:54,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I think so.</font>

377
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:57,025
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to hear that.</font>

378
00:21:57,755 --> 00:22:00,555
<font color=#FFFF00>From my perspective, under the contract,</font>

379
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm merely exercising my right as an investor.</font>

380
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:07,055
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd be grateful if you can understand.</font>

381
00:22:20,655 --> 00:22:22,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui. Did you make the presentation for this?</font>

382
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:24,555
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not done.</font>

383
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:28,125
<font color=#FFFF00>This is urgent. How could you have not finished this already?</font>

384
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:29,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on one second.</font>

385
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:32,825
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Park. Here's your coffee. - Thanks.</font>

386
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I will finish it before I go home.</font>

387
00:22:35,225 --> 00:22:38,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui. Please finish your assignments in a timely manner.</font>

388
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:41,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know we're busy with new products for the upcoming season?</font>

389
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:46,325
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

390
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:48,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. You are here.</font>

391
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:49,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Sir.</font>

392
00:22:50,785 --> 00:22:53,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui. What are you doing here?</font>

393
00:22:53,825 --> 00:22:55,885
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - Why did you come to work?</font>

394
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't you be writing at home?</font>

395
00:22:57,855 --> 00:22:58,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

396
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:02,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. We are very busy, too.</font>

397
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,185
<font color=#FFFF00>New products will be launching soon.</font>

398
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:08,125
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter. She is a writer who has to write scripts.</font>

399
00:23:08,355 --> 00:23:10,355
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you make her do work like this?</font>

400
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:11,625
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't mean any harm.</font>

401
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,185
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her to come to work.</font>

402
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether she is a writer or not,</font>

403
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,285
<font color=#FFFF00>the fact that she is our assistant hasn't changed.</font>

404
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:24,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. Can we have a moment?</font>

405
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:40,925
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it this time? Did something happen?</font>

406
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:42,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no clue.</font>

407
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,685
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the investor came to visit.</font>

408
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:45,825
<font color=#FFFF00>The investor?</font>

409
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:48,925
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to comply with his demand.</font>

410
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:50,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't allow it.</font>

411
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,625
<font color=#FFFF00>So we are not going to accept any demands from the investors?</font>

412
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:56,555
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't bite the hands that feed us.</font>

413
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to ruin the drama?</font>

414
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,555
<font color=#FFFF00>We won't ruin it then.</font>

415
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it matter of the writer's ability?</font>

416
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:06,555
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to give them some breathing room.</font>

417
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:09,455
<font color=#FFFF00>In a romantic comedy of 16-episode drama, where can the writer...</font>

418
00:24:09,585 --> 00:24:11,185
<font color=#FFFF00>include the secret behind the character's birth?</font>

419
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:12,585
<font color=#FFFF00>It's possible.</font>

420
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:13,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Mi Joo.</font>

421
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this how you've been handling your business?</font>

422
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:19,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. Don't be dramatic. Try to compromise.</font>

423
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,725
<font color=#FFFF00>We can only produce the drama with the fund from the investor.</font>

424
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,285
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't change the fact that...</font>

425
00:24:24,285 --> 00:24:26,085
<font color=#FFFF00>putting in the storyline is absurd.</font>

426
00:24:26,085 --> 00:24:28,255
<font color=#FFFF00>All we need is good ratings for us to make profits!</font>

427
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:29,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang!</font>

428
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Hong. What was that?</font>

429
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Director Han just yell?</font>

430
00:24:34,885 --> 00:24:36,185
<font color=#FFFF00>I think he did.</font>

431
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:41,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Did he yell because we told Ms. Oh Dong Hui to come to work?</font>

432
00:24:41,585 --> 00:24:42,885
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

433
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are they fighting?</font>

434
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,655
<font color=#FFFF00>This is getting scary.</font>

435
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think there's a problem?</font>

436
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui. Do you know anything about this?</font>

437
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:52,625
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

438
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,455
<font color=#FFFF00>- A secret of the character's birth? - Yes.</font>

439
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:02,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Why do I have to include it?</font>

440
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:04,425
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

441
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,755
<font color=#FFFF00>This might sound funny, but the investor wants it in the drama.</font>

442
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:13,025
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be. I have never thought about that possibility.</font>

443
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:14,855
<font color=#FFFF00>That makes two of us.</font>

444
00:25:17,285 --> 00:25:19,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui. In times like this, you can't be flustered.</font>

445
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You must get a hold of yourself.</font>

446
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:23,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Once the writer starts getting affected by other people,</font>

447
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:26,485
<font color=#FFFF00>from that point on, you won't be able to manage.</font>

448
00:25:26,885 --> 00:25:29,255
<font color=#FFFF00>But if the investor demands it,</font>

449
00:25:29,255 --> 00:25:31,285
<font color=#FFFF00>how can a novice writer like me refuse?</font>

450
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:32,655
<font color=#FFFF00>You have me.</font>

451
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:35,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I would look out for you.</font>

452
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:44,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why I feel so lonely today.</font>

453
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:47,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like...</font>

454
00:25:47,885 --> 00:25:50,225
<font color=#FFFF00>there are only two of us in this entire world.</font>

455
00:25:54,325 --> 00:25:57,985
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make sure you write what you want to write by any means.</font>

456
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,685
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do this, right?</font>

457
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:07,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, then. I won't be swayed by the investor.</font>

458
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,755
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Please write good scripts.</font>

459
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:14,355
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, will you be okay with handling both work and the scripts?</font>

460
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:18,485
<font color=#FFFF00>I will try my best. I will ask for leave of absence time to time.</font>

461
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,185
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have much time. Start writing now.</font>

462
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's talk more after you write.</font>

463
00:26:50,785 --> 00:26:51,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

464
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:02,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

465
00:27:04,655 --> 00:27:07,385
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you that you don't need to come as often as before.</font>

466
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,925
<font color=#FFFF00>President, but still...</font>

467
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:13,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You have nothing to report.</font>

468
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:17,185
<font color=#FFFF00>My father passed away 23 years ago.</font>

469
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:20,325
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother died, then.</font>

470
00:27:22,525 --> 00:27:23,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I have...</font>

471
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,385
<font color=#FFFF00>nothing left.</font>

472
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:30,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I should wrap up this revenge quickly.</font>

473
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:33,655
<font color=#FFFF00>I plan on returning to the US and throw a party.</font>

474
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:36,455
<font color=#FFFF00>President.</font>

475
00:27:36,985 --> 00:27:38,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you've been drinking a lot lately.</font>

476
00:27:42,155 --> 00:27:44,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I have nothing to live for nowadays.</font>

477
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:50,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, you should listen to the report regarding Han Seong Sik.</font>

478
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:53,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

479
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:57,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what has Han Seong Sik...</font>

480
00:27:57,755 --> 00:27:58,925
<font color=#FFFF00>been doing lately?</font>

481
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:02,355
<font color=#FFFF00>He's been locked inside his office for two days.</font>

482
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Only he would do such a thing.</font>

483
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:11,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to finish him as soon as possible.</font>

484
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,225
<font color=#FFFF00>From the start, he was too interested in money, power,</font>

485
00:28:16,525 --> 00:28:18,025
<font color=#FFFF00>reputation, and women.</font>

486
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:21,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost my interest since he was an easy prey.</font>

487
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:24,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Things will be settled in a few days.</font>

488
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:29,525
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what will you do about Seong Joon?</font>

489
00:28:30,655 --> 00:28:34,485
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you'd take care of him yourself.</font>

490
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:39,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm writing a drama these days.</font>

491
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:44,285
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir? - I'm writing a drama with him.</font>

492
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,055
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the most fun thing.</font>

493
00:28:49,485 --> 00:28:51,025
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll take care of that,</font>

494
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:53,425
<font color=#FFFF00>so you should take care of Seong Sik as soon as possible.</font>

495
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:56,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I will do that.</font>

496
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Also...</font>

497
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:02,655
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is it now? - Today,</font>

498
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun contacted me.</font>

499
00:29:09,855 --> 00:29:12,285
<font color=#FFFF00>She wants to close her coffee shop.</font>

500
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Let her do whatever she wants.</font>

501
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,725
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems like...</font>

502
00:29:18,785 --> 00:29:20,885
<font color=#FFFF00>she's leaving for some place.</font>

503
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:22,555
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not interested.</font>

504
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:26,385
<font color=#FFFF00>President.</font>

505
00:29:27,085 --> 00:29:28,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to sleep. You should leave now.</font>

506
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,725
<font color=#FFFF00>(1 message)</font>

507
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:51,585
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me. Please answer your phone.</font>

508
00:29:53,255 --> 00:29:54,885
<font color=#FFFF00>He's unbelievable.</font>

509
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,925
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't answer the phone again, I will go to your place.</font>

510
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,155
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

511
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,185
<font color=#FFFF00>He's crazy.</font>

512
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:18,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

513
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:22,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Do whatever you want.</font>

514
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:25,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never come back to Korea.</font>

515
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

516
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:39,985
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

517
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:42,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm leaving Korea tonight, Mom.</font>

518
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going again?</font>

519
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:49,985
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. I will go wherever I can go with the cheapest flight.</font>

520
00:30:50,285 --> 00:30:52,525
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

521
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,285
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need me, do you? You have Dad.</font>

522
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,555
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that?</font>

523
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you meet your dad?</font>

524
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Since he's back, you should try to work things out with him.</font>

525
00:31:03,855 --> 00:31:05,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

526
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:09,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't hate him so much. He came back just for you.</font>

527
00:31:09,725 --> 00:31:12,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go now, Mom.</font>

528
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:15,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Jeong Eun!</font>

529
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:19,955
<font color=#FFFF00>What is she thinking?</font>

530
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:54,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine! I hope you're happy, you jerk!</font>

531
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:57,155
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you dump a girl like that?</font>

532
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:59,785
<font color=#FFFF00>We dated for four months,</font>

533
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,855
<font color=#FFFF00>and I gave you my heart, my love, and my body...</font>

534
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I gave you everything, and you changed so quickly.

535
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:09,585
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you play with me?</font>

536
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. I hope you're happy with your life.</font>

537
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never see you again.</font>

538
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you will be unlucky for the next 30 years, you jerk.</font>

539
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:22,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Did you say you played with me?</font>

540
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:25,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you are the only one? I did as well.</font>

541
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:28,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I played well! I played well!</font>

542
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:31,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you! Goodbye, you jerk!</font>

543
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh!</font>

544
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:46,655
<font color=#FFFF00>The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.</font>

545
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:48,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Your call will be charged after the beep.</font>

546
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,655
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not picking up the call.</font>

547
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,985
<font color=#FFFF00>What if she actually leaves?</font>

548
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:56,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

549
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:14,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did she go?</font>

550
00:33:16,725 --> 00:33:20,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Please open the windows</font>

551
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:27,155
<font color=#FFFF00>- I miss you my darling - What is this now?</font>

552
00:33:32,055 --> 00:33:35,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't sing without an accompaniment.</font>

553
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:46,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I have dreamed thee too long</font>

554
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:49,985
<font color=#FFFF00>But known thee</font>

555
00:33:49,985 --> 00:33:54,885
<font color=#FFFF00>With all of my heart</font>

556
00:33:56,925 --> 00:34:01,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Half a prayer, half a song</font>

557
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:06,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Thou hast always been with me</font>

558
00:34:06,155 --> 00:34:11,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Though we have been always apart</font>

559
00:34:12,755 --> 00:34:18,955
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dulcinea - Is he out of his mind?</font>

560
00:34:19,425 --> 00:34:24,025
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dulcinea - Wait there.</font>

561
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:28,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I see heaven when I see thee</font>

562
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:33,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

563
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:39,985
<font color=#FFFF00>And thy name is like a prayer</font>

564
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:44,555
<font color=#FFFF00>An angel whispers</font>

565
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:50,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

566
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:57,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

567
00:34:58,785 --> 00:35:03,155
<font color=#FFFF00>If I reach out to thee</font>

568
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:06,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Do not tremble and shrink</font>

569
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:11,225
<font color=#FFFF00>From the touch of my hand on thy hair</font>

570
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:17,425
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is this a dream - We're taking you in.</font>

571
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

572
00:35:22,725 --> 00:35:24,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri. Ae Ri.</font>

573
00:35:25,785 --> 00:35:28,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come back tomorrow. Good night.</font>

574
00:35:36,785 --> 00:35:37,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

575
00:35:58,555 --> 00:35:59,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

576
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't study if you don't want to.</font>

577
00:36:03,025 --> 00:36:04,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't tell you to study, did I?</font>

578
00:36:05,355 --> 00:36:07,185
<font color=#FFFF00>So let's move out.</font>

579
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,955
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that easy to move.</font>

580
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,525
<font color=#FFFF00>You can just find your peace of mind.</font>

581
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,155
<font color=#FFFF00>The problem is that I can't find my peace of mind.</font>

582
00:36:16,285 --> 00:36:18,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't you find your peace of mind?</font>

583
00:36:18,725 --> 00:36:21,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Your biological mother is right here.</font>

584
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:23,885
<font color=#FFFF00>And yet you can't defy your former mom.</font>

585
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:25,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do it if you don't want to.</font>

586
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Saying once a son, forever a son,</font>

587
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:30,185
<font color=#FFFF00>she always pushes me to study.</font>

588
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why are you angry at me...</font>

589
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,225
<font color=#FFFF00>for not wanting to study?</font>

590
00:36:39,885 --> 00:36:41,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

591
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In,</font>

592
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,325
<font color=#FFFF00>you don't have to study if you don't want to.</font>

593
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:50,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Since when did you care about Chinese characters?</font>

594
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:51,985
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to do it if you don't want to.</font>

595
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,555
<font color=#FFFF00>But Aunt will scold me if I don't do it.</font>

596
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,625
<font color=#FFFF00>What? This is unbelievable.</font>

597
00:36:59,825 --> 00:37:03,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Ah In, whose daughter are you? Are you Aunt's daughter?</font>

598
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:07,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me where you belong.</font>

599
00:37:16,455 --> 00:37:19,485
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's up with you now? - Where is my bean?</font>

600
00:37:25,725 --> 00:37:28,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. I can't believe I'm doing this.</font>

601
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

602
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

603
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:06,385
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

604
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:09,095
<font color=#FFFF00>This is tough.</font>

605
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,685
<font color=#FFFF00>What's so tough?</font>

606
00:38:13,955 --> 00:38:16,355
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not cooked enough.</font>

607
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:20,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey,</font>

608
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:23,185
<font color=#FFFF00>do you think I'm your servant?</font>

609
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:25,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you? You tell me to buy you an Italian songbook,</font>

610
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,125
<font color=#FFFF00>fill up the humidifier with water,</font>

611
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,485
<font color=#FFFF00>draw you a bath, and boil the beans.</font>

612
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm your servant?</font>

613
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,955
<font color=#FFFF00>My mom did all those things for me.</font>

614
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:39,025
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying. Ask her to do it when she comes back.</font>

615
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,225
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't do that.</font>

616
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Once a mom, always a mom. You're my mom, too.</font>

617
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:43,955
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

618
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:45,595
<font color=#FFFF00>Look.</font>

619
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:47,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to memorize these lyrics.</font>

620
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:50,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Could you bring me a cup of water?</font>

621
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:52,855
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

622
00:38:59,925 --> 00:39:02,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen up, everyone!</font>

623
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:08,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook isn't home right now.</font>

624
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:11,055
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't want to study, don't study.</font>

625
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:14,455
<font color=#FFFF00>If you want water, get it yourself with your own hands.</font>

626
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,095
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

627
00:39:17,285 --> 00:39:18,425
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better...</font>

628
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:20,755
<font color=#FFFF00>stay quiet today.</font>

629
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:25,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I will give you a good scolding if you upset me in any way!</font>

630
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:33,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

631
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:40,425
<font color=#FFFF00>A piano?</font>

632
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:43,985
<font color=#FFFF00>The chest?</font>

633
00:39:45,655 --> 00:39:47,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir!</font>

634
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:50,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I never said I wanted to sell this!</font>

635
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:53,055
<font color=#FFFF00>We've already closed the bargain, Ma'am.</font>

636
00:39:53,055 --> 00:39:55,225
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not important right now!</font>

637
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:57,325
<font color=#FFFF00>We're taking this chest in exchange...</font>

638
00:39:57,325 --> 00:39:59,485
<font color=#FFFF00>for a discount on the piano. I told you already. See?</font>

639
00:39:59,485 --> 00:40:01,925
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care. You can't take this!</font>

640
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,825
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go. - No. You can't do this.</font>

641
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:05,885
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let it go, Ma'am. - No! Put it down!</font>

642
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:06,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Put it down!</font>

643
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Put it down, Sir! Hey!</font>

644
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:23,385
<font color=#FFFF00>- Is it fun, Ah In? - Yes.</font>

645
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:25,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you play the piano now, Chang Soo?</font>

646
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I should learn how to play the piano...</font>

647
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:29,555
<font color=#FFFF00>to become a great opera singer.</font>

648
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:39,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

649
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Put Hee Sook on the phone right now.</font>

650
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,425
<font color=#FFFF00>She's there, isn't she?</font>

651
00:40:45,385 --> 00:40:46,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

652
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:50,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she really sell your chest without talking to you about it?</font>

653
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:52,225
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

654
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:55,285
<font color=#FFFF00>I took a day off...</font>

655
00:40:55,525 --> 00:40:58,555
<font color=#FFFF00>and stayed home because the kids are on their spring vacation.</font>

656
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook sent guys to take...</font>

657
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:04,725
<font color=#FFFF00>my chest, the article that my parents left me.</font>

658
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Put her on the phone now.</font>

659
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:09,095
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to kill her today.</font>

660
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:14,385
<font color=#FFFF00>She disguised herself as the cafe owner...</font>

661
00:41:14,925 --> 00:41:16,185
<font color=#FFFF00>and went out to buy food.</font>

662
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:18,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, what?</font>

663
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe her.</font>

664
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:26,285
<font color=#FFFF00>You should come home, then.</font>

665
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:29,655
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too upset that I'm going crazy here.</font>

666
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. I know how you feel,</font>

667
00:41:32,595 --> 00:41:35,025
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can't just leave right now.</font>

668
00:41:35,055 --> 00:41:38,025
<font color=#FFFF00>What does it have to do with you? You can just leave!</font>

669
00:41:39,155 --> 00:41:41,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... Actually,</font>

670
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:45,685
<font color=#FFFF00>it's partly my fault that this happened to Seong Sik.</font>

671
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:47,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is it your fault?</font>

672
00:41:48,485 --> 00:41:51,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know Reporter Yim from Jinsung Daily News I worked with?</font>

673
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:53,985
<font color=#FFFF00>He came to see me a few days ago.</font>

674
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,685
<font color=#FFFF00>He asked me for documents on the corrupt relationship...</font>

675
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:59,595
<font color=#FFFF00>between Minjeong Party and Seonghan Group, so I gave them to him.</font>

676
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik of all people got involved in it.</font>

677
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:05,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

678
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,625
<font color=#FFFF00>It's driving me crazy now.</font>

679
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:11,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

680
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,925
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say, Seong Hoon?</font>

681
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,125
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you get back?</font>

682
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:23,095
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say...</font>

683
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:25,955
<font color=#FFFF00>you handed over documents to Jinsung Daily News?</font>

684
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:28,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me explain, Seong Sik.</font>

685
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,725
<font color=#FFFF00>How... How could you do this to me, Seong Hoon?</font>

686
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:36,655
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do this to your brother? How could you?</font>

687
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,455
<font color=#FFFF00>- How? - Wait, Seong Sik.</font>

688
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:42,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik. What's wrong?</font>

689
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,955
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you do this to me?</font>

690
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:47,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. Why is he doing this?</font>

691
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:49,825
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong, Seong Sik? Let go of him first.</font>

692
00:42:49,825 --> 00:42:50,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off of me.</font>

693
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:53,485
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you...</font>

694
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,185
<font color=#FFFF00>help people ruin your brother?</font>

695
00:42:58,025 --> 00:42:59,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of a person does that?</font>

696
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Who does that?</font>

697
00:43:01,655 --> 00:43:04,255
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who? - It's not that, Seong Sik.</font>

698
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:05,595
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me explain.</font>

699
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:06,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon!</font>

700
00:43:07,055 --> 00:43:09,625
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon! - I'm sorry.</font>

701
00:43:09,725 --> 00:43:10,855
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this be?</font>

702
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:16,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Hwang.</font>

703
00:43:16,485 --> 00:43:19,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you get up and eat some porridge?</font>

704
00:43:19,825 --> 00:43:21,555
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I don't want to eat anything.</font>

705
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:24,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on now. Please get up.</font>

706
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:25,955
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - Here.</font>

707
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:30,095
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything tastes bitter.</font>

708
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:34,155
<font color=#FFFF00>My grandson is on the front page of the newspaper...</font>

709
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:36,685
<font color=#FFFF00>for doing something bad.</font>

710
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:39,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his grandmother. How can I be eating now?</font>

711
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:44,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that. You should eat.</font>

712
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:48,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it's not something so terrible.</font>

713
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,185
<font color=#FFFF00>He wasn't arrested or anything.</font>

714
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:52,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Arrested?</font>

715
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:56,225
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you say that?</font>

716
00:43:56,355 --> 00:43:58,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What I'm trying to say is...</font>

717
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:01,955
<font color=#FFFF00>it may turn out to be something not so serious.</font>

718
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:06,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Sometimes you get into trouble,</font>

719
00:44:06,255 --> 00:44:09,825
<font color=#FFFF00>and sometimes you have bad things happen to you.</font>

720
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:13,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, your second grandson was on...</font>

721
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:14,785
<font color=#FFFF00>many TV shows.</font>

722
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:18,525
<font color=#FFFF00>He has been on everyone's lips.</font>

723
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,225
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying.</font>

724
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,585
<font color=#FFFF00>He always has been so fond of the limelight.</font>

725
00:44:22,585 --> 00:44:25,485
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew something like this would happen to him someday.</font>

726
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:30,255
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Ms. Hwang.</font>

727
00:44:30,455 --> 00:44:32,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

728
00:44:36,655 --> 00:44:37,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going out.</font>

729
00:44:38,455 --> 00:44:41,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Please eat the porridge when you feel better.</font>

730
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:43,855
<font color=#FFFF00>We're old women.</font>

731
00:44:43,855 --> 00:44:46,325
<font color=#FFFF00>If we worry too much, we will soon die.</font>

732
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Please try to ease your mind, okay?</font>

733
00:45:05,555 --> 00:45:07,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Ms. Oh Dong Hui?</font>

734
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:08,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, President Bang.</font>

735
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:11,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

736
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:14,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you were signing the contract today.</font>

737
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:17,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I just called you here to meet you. Don't be scared.</font>

738
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:19,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not, Sir.</font>

739
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Your grandmother is Ms. Oh Gui Boon, right?</font>

740
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:27,985
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you know my grandmother?</font>

741
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:33,555
<font color=#FFFF00>I grew up eating the food your grandmother made.</font>

742
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:38,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you?</font>

743
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,855
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know.</font>

744
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:45,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess she didn't tell you. That's disappointing.</font>

745
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,685
<font color=#FFFF00>You're her granddaughter,</font>

746
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,155
<font color=#FFFF00>so that'd make you my niece.</font>

747
00:45:53,855 --> 00:45:56,625
<font color=#FFFF00>You can relax. Treat me like your uncle.</font>

748
00:45:58,725 --> 00:45:59,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

749
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,555
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard both of your parents passed away.</font>

750
00:46:04,755 --> 00:46:08,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. They died when I was little.</font>

751
00:46:08,155 --> 00:46:10,725
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why my grandmother raised me.</font>

752
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,285
<font color=#FFFF00>You look much better in person.</font>

753
00:46:14,225 --> 00:46:17,555
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't resemble your grandmother at all.</font>

754
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:21,025
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

755
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,155
<font color=#FFFF00>you somehow look familiar to me.</font>

756
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:27,155
<font color=#FFFF00>My grandmother...</font>

757
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:29,725
<font color=#FFFF00>always told me that I look just like my mother.</font>

758
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:34,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

759
00:46:36,355 --> 00:46:37,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...</font>

760
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:41,455
<font color=#FFFF00>know my parents well, by any chance?</font>

761
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:45,385
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure about that.</font>

762
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:50,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if your parents are the ones I knew or not.</font>

763
00:46:52,385 --> 00:46:54,785
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyhow, congratulations on becoming...</font>

764
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:56,525
<font color=#FFFF00>our company's scriptwriter.</font>

765
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:57,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope to see you often.</font>

766
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:01,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Sir.</font>

767
00:47:22,955 --> 00:47:25,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui. Can I talk to you for a second?</font>

768
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't Director Han come to work today? Is everything okay?</font>

769
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:42,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

770
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:45,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not sure why he didn't.</font>

771
00:47:45,785 --> 00:47:47,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you two come to work together?</font>

772
00:47:48,325 --> 00:47:51,125
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't like us coming to work together.</font>

773
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you messing with me right now?</font>

774
00:47:53,225 --> 00:47:54,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you have to push ahead...</font>

775
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:56,685
<font color=#FFFF00>to include a secret behind the character's birth?</font>

776
00:47:57,055 --> 00:47:58,125
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

777
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:01,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han had a hard time because of it.</font>

778
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:04,755
<font color=#FFFF00>You know better than anyone that he hates those things.</font>

779
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,325
<font color=#FFFF00>What about you? What do you think?</font>

780
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:13,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess we can include it when it's absolutely necessary,</font>

781
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:16,855
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm opposed to it if it's merely for the ratings.</font>

782
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:20,325
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be a reason why we have to have such a setting.</font>

783
00:48:20,955 --> 00:48:23,055
<font color=#FFFF00>You've become so arrogant.</font>

784
00:48:23,485 --> 00:48:27,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you're a sought-after writer or something? Listen.</font>

785
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,025
<font color=#FFFF00>If we fail to attract investors, Director Han will be fired.</font>

786
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:33,125
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's not what you want,</font>

787
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:35,355
<font color=#FFFF00>you'd better think about it again.</font>

788
00:48:58,055 --> 00:48:59,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

789
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:01,425
<font color=#FFFF00>I really didn't know...</font>

790
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:05,785
<font color=#FFFF00>you'd gladly say okay and come here.</font>

791
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,785
<font color=#FFFF00>House chores are...</font>

792
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:11,785
<font color=#FFFF00>much better than cleaning apartment buildings.</font>

793
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:13,255
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

794
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that you're here,</font>

795
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:19,655
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like we've gone back to the old days.</font>

796
00:49:20,985 --> 00:49:22,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad to hear that.</font>

797
00:49:24,355 --> 00:49:27,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going? Please take a seat.</font>

798
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:31,955
<font color=#FFFF00>You stayed until we finish our meals...</font>

799
00:49:32,185 --> 00:49:33,485
<font color=#FFFF00>and served more side dishes as well.</font>

800
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not talk about the past.</font>

801
00:49:42,955 --> 00:49:44,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

802
00:49:46,825 --> 00:49:48,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because it reminds you of Gwang Ho?</font>

803
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:52,555
<font color=#FFFF00>You know...</font>

804
00:49:53,855 --> 00:49:55,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Gwang Ho is dead, right?</font>

805
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:58,125
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

806
00:50:00,425 --> 00:50:01,855
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that?</font>

807
00:50:02,885 --> 00:50:06,455
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been reported in newspapers. He had a boat accident.</font>

808
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:09,025
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. You saw it in newspapers.</font>

809
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:11,425
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

810
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:14,885
<font color=#FFFF00>you didn't come to his funeral, did you?</font>

811
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:19,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you my life was too hectic at that time.</font>

812
00:50:19,985 --> 00:50:21,955
<font color=#FFFF00>That's nonsense.</font>

813
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:25,385
<font color=#FFFF00>You favoured Gwang Ho a lot more than me.</font>

814
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:29,855
<font color=#FFFF00>When did I favor Gwang Ho more?</font>

815
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:31,685
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure you didn't?</font>

816
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:34,585
<font color=#FFFF00>President and you...</font>

817
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:37,755
<font color=#FFFF00>loved him more than you loved me.</font>

818
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:42,125
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't pay attention to me at all.</font>

819
00:50:42,425 --> 00:50:44,325
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not true.</font>

820
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:47,725
<font color=#FFFF00>If you keep saying such nonsense,</font>

821
00:50:48,185 --> 00:50:51,255
<font color=#FFFF00>- I won't come here anymore. - You won't come here?</font>

822
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:57,655
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you came here for a reason.</font>

823
00:51:00,155 --> 00:51:02,185
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean by that?</font>

824
00:51:03,055 --> 00:51:06,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I called you and visited you so often,</font>

825
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,485
<font color=#FFFF00>so you decided to have a close watch...</font>

826
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:11,855
<font color=#FFFF00>on me here, while avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings.</font>

827
00:51:12,325 --> 00:51:13,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that why you're here?</font>

828
00:51:13,855 --> 00:51:16,655
<font color=#FFFF00>What... What did you say?</font>

829
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:17,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Or...</font>

830
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:21,425
<font color=#FFFF00>are you here because you miss my mother...</font>

831
00:51:21,655 --> 00:51:23,785
<font color=#FFFF00>who's gone missing?</font>

832
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:26,625
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you talking about?</font>

833
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,485
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter. I live alone since my wife died.</font>

834
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:32,725
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm happy to be with you here.</font>

835
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:37,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, please put some egg on it.</font>

836
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:41,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, Mom.</font>

837
00:51:41,685 --> 00:51:45,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to eat it. Please.</font>

838
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:28,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han, are you in?</font>

839
00:52:29,585 --> 00:52:30,625
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you in?</font>

840
00:52:30,925 --> 00:52:33,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does Seong Sik make me worried all the time?</font>

841
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

842
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:42,285
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing there?</font>

843
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you knocking...</font>

844
00:52:49,325 --> 00:52:52,085
<font color=#FFFF00>on the door of Seong Joon's room at this late hour?</font>

845
00:52:52,355 --> 00:52:56,085
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to tell him.</font>

846
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:58,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is still at work.</font>

847
00:53:01,455 --> 00:53:04,255
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I am sorry.</font>

848
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:06,955
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui,</font>

849
00:53:07,325 --> 00:53:10,285
<font color=#FFFF00>enough is enough.</font>

850
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:14,525
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sorry? - Do you know what happened to us?</font>

851
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:18,885
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone of my family is anxious and disturbed at this moment.</font>

852
00:53:18,885 --> 00:53:22,425
<font color=#FFFF00>And do you want to fool around in Seong Joon's room that badly?</font>

853
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:25,955
<font color=#FFFF00>- I just... - Be quiet. I don't want excuses!</font>

854
00:53:26,255 --> 00:53:30,155
<font color=#FFFF00>You're living off us now. Then, you should behave at least!</font>

855
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:33,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so slow-witted? Are you a kid?</font>

856
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:37,325
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize. I'm so sorry.</font>

857
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:27,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Both the broadcasting station and my company liked the scenario...</font>

858
00:54:27,885 --> 00:54:30,455
<font color=#FFFF00>because it isn't clichéd at all...</font>

859
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:32,085
<font color=#FFFF00>and unique.</font>

860
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,725
<font color=#FFFF00>We cannot get rid of such charms.</font>

861
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:39,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you not like it?</font>

862
00:54:41,755 --> 00:54:44,155
<font color=#FFFF00>You also have a secret behind your birth.</font>

863
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:50,455
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you trying to tell me?</font>

864
00:54:50,725 --> 00:54:52,755
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought we'd speak the same language...</font>

865
00:54:53,385 --> 00:54:55,255
<font color=#FFFF00>as we both were raised in an orphanage.</font>

866
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:59,425
<font color=#FFFF00>A man encounters a wrongful death...</font>

867
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,325
<font color=#FFFF00>and leaves his two sons.</font>

868
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:05,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Since then, the two sons are separated...</font>

869
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:08,785
<font color=#FFFF00>from each other for more than 20 years,</font>

870
00:55:09,385 --> 00:55:12,055
<font color=#FFFF00>unable to know whether their brother is still alive.</font>

871
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:15,455
<font color=#FFFF00>One of them is looking for his brother,</font>

872
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,155
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's not easy at all.</font>

873
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,225
<font color=#FFFF00>If the other one also had tried to find his brother,</font>

874
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:24,685
<font color=#FFFF00>they might have been able to meet earlier.</font>

875
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:28,155
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it dramatic?</font>

876
00:55:29,455 --> 00:55:30,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee,</font>

877
00:55:31,085 --> 00:55:34,455
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about your private matter.</font>

878
00:55:35,855 --> 00:55:38,985
<font color=#FFFF00>Yet, bringing it to the plot is unacceptable.</font>

879
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:41,055
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you...</font>

880
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,985
<font color=#FFFF00>what investors expect. I invested my money,</font>

881
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:47,225
<font color=#FFFF00>then it should produce good results.</font>

882
00:55:47,925 --> 00:55:51,525
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how I'm able to run a world-class investment company.</font>

883
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:59,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were polite and sincere,</font>

884
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:00,785
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was wrong.</font>

885
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:05,455
<font color=#FFFF00>You privately hired your in-law who lives in your rooftop as a writer.</font>

886
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:07,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't hire her because she's my in-law.</font>

887
00:56:08,585 --> 00:56:10,455
<font color=#FFFF00>You would know if you read her scenario.</font>

888
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:13,985
<font color=#FFFF00>There are countless writers who can write like her.</font>

889
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:16,185
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

890
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:19,525
<font color=#FFFF00>you failed to put your personal feelings aside.</font>

891
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:22,625
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not true.</font>

892
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:24,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Moreover,</font>

893
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:27,225
<font color=#FFFF00>you visit an investor without making an appointment...</font>

894
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:30,385
<font color=#FFFF00>and complain about his decision without presenting any base data.</font>

895
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:35,255
<font color=#FFFF00>You were raised by a father who only cares about his children...</font>

896
00:56:36,055 --> 00:56:37,655
<font color=#FFFF00>and spent a comfortable childhood.</font>

897
00:56:38,725 --> 00:56:42,225
<font color=#FFFF00>- I guess that's why you're rude. - If you felt that way, I apologize.</font>

898
00:56:43,325 --> 00:56:45,655
<font color=#FFFF00>But you've crossed the line.</font>

899
00:56:47,455 --> 00:56:48,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

900
00:56:49,685 --> 00:56:52,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Did I offend you by mentioning your father?</font>

901
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,555
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, you did.</font>

902
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:59,585
<font color=#FFFF00>But I know quite a lot about your father.</font>

903
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:05,325
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone has their dark side.</font>

904
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:09,325
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you talking about? - All fathers have...</font>

905
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:12,685
<font color=#FFFF00>their own ugly side they want to hide...</font>

906
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:15,655
<font color=#FFFF00>from their children.</font>

907
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:20,655
<font color=#FFFF00>And your father is no different.</font>

908
00:57:44,525 --> 00:57:46,025
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to meet now.</font>

909
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:02,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

910
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:04,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you call me earlier?</font>

911
00:58:04,055 --> 00:58:07,255
<font color=#FFFF00>I stayed here all day long to decide the location of my store.</font>

912
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:11,025
<font color=#FFFF00>We could've had dinner together if you had called me earlier.</font>

913
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I called you because I have a few questions.</font>

914
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:24,185
<font color=#FFFF00>A question?</font>

915
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:25,755
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

916
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:30,485
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

917
00:58:31,985 --> 00:58:33,625
<font color=#FFFF00>my birth mother?</font>

918
00:58:35,955 --> 00:58:36,955
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

919
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Please answer me.</font>

920
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:40,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you're such a rude brat.</font>

921
00:58:41,055 --> 00:58:44,355
<font color=#FFFF00>It took a long time for you to ask that question.</font>

922
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell me the truth.</font>

923
00:58:47,325 --> 00:58:48,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, how scary.</font>

924
00:58:49,085 --> 00:58:51,355
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm too scared to tell you the truth.</font>

925
00:58:59,985 --> 00:59:01,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen.</font>

926
00:59:01,855 --> 00:59:03,955
<font color=#FFFF00>I assumed it when you just left without a word...</font>

927
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:06,825
<font color=#FFFF00>after giving me the money. You shouldn't be like this.</font>

928
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:09,455
<font color=#FFFF00>Your late father will resent you.</font>

929
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:12,885
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

930
00:59:13,155 --> 00:59:15,485
<font color=#FFFF00>I said your late father will resent you.</font>

931
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:18,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know my birth father?</font>

932
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:20,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course.</font>

933
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:24,525
<font color=#FFFF00>When you were little, your father brought you to my store...</font>

934
00:59:24,525 --> 00:59:26,255
<font color=#FFFF00>whenever he wanted to drink.</font>

935
00:59:26,385 --> 00:59:29,285
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I only have one father.</font>

936
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:31,225
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I've always believed.</font>

937
00:59:31,555 --> 00:59:34,985
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why the father you have now is such a bad man.</font>

938
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:38,085
<font color=#FFFF00>He deceived you completely.</font>

939
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,385
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know that?</font>

940
00:59:59,025 --> 01:00:00,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

941
01:00:09,255 --> 01:00:12,585
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? Did something happen to you today?</font>

942
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:42,185
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I can include a secret behind the character's birth.</font>

943
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:44,555
<font color=#FFFF00>I've given it some thought.</font>

944
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:45,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

945
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:49,525
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

946
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing.</font>

947
01:00:53,925 --> 01:00:54,925
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind.</font>

948
01:00:57,085 --> 01:01:00,155
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter? What is it?</font>

949
01:01:05,425 --> 01:01:06,525
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

950
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:12,755
<font color=#FFFF00>I was...</font>

951
01:01:14,385 --> 01:01:16,255
<font color=#FFFF00>adopted by this family when I was seven.</font>

952
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:20,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Up until now,</font>

953
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I was a child my father had with another woman.</font>

954
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:26,825
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

955
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:30,985
<font color=#FFFF00>To be exact, I chose...</font>

956
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:32,585
<font color=#FFFF00>to believe that.</font>

957
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:36,825
<font color=#FFFF00>How could that be?</font>

958
01:01:37,725 --> 01:01:39,655
<font color=#FFFF00>There hasn't been any problem so far.</font>

959
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:41,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been happy.</font>

960
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:47,425
<font color=#FFFF00>But everything seems to be...</font>

961
01:01:50,325 --> 01:01:52,155
<font color=#FFFF00>so confusing right now.</font>

962
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:56,625
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what the truth is,</font>

963
01:01:58,885 --> 01:02:01,055
<font color=#FFFF00>or whether I should know the truth or not.</font>

964
01:02:03,285 --> 01:02:04,385
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know...</font>

965
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:08,785
<font color=#FFFF00>why this is happening to me.</font>

966
01:02:11,625 --> 01:02:12,825
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know any of that.</font>

967
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,185
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

968
01:02:24,225 --> 01:02:25,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what I should do.</font>

969
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so confused.</font>

970
01:02:34,055 --> 01:02:36,155
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know where things went wrong,</font>

971
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:38,285
<font color=#FFFF00>and...</font>

972
01:02:40,085 --> 01:02:42,325
<font color=#FFFF00>what happens to the things I've believed until now.</font>

973
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:46,585
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like dying.</font>

974
01:02:49,685 --> 01:02:50,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

975
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:54,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do this.</font>

976
01:02:54,755 --> 01:02:57,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you're a strong person.</font>

977
01:02:58,485 --> 01:02:59,725
<font color=#FFFF00>Please calm down.</font>

978
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,225
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't cry.</font>

979
01:03:14,755 --> 01:03:16,925
<font color=#FFFF00>You're making me want to cry, too.</font>

980
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:03,985
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

981
01:04:04,555 --> 01:04:05,825
<font color=#FFFF00>Seon Mi is doing a good job.</font>

982
01:04:06,485 --> 01:04:08,255
<font color=#FFFF00>They're going to eat and drink all night.</font>

983
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:10,025
<font color=#FFFF00>People just love free stuff.</font>

984
01:04:11,555 --> 01:04:14,855
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is great. - Can I have some more beer?</font>

985
01:04:15,325 --> 01:04:18,355
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you tell them the free food was for?</font>

986
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,525
<font color=#FFFF00>I told them today is the day my brother died.</font>

987
01:04:20,725 --> 01:04:22,885
<font color=#FFFF00>I told them I was feeding chicken to people...</font>

988
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,655
<font color=#FFFF00>in my dead brother's age to honor him.</font>

989
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:25,655
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Seong Hoon!</font>

990
01:04:26,025 --> 01:04:27,655
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all your fault!</font>

991
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,525
<font color=#FFFF00>You handed over the documents!</font>

992
01:04:29,525 --> 01:04:31,055
<font color=#FFFF00>Lower your voice, you brat.</font>

993
01:04:31,685 --> 01:04:33,125
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

994
01:04:33,485 --> 01:04:34,755
<font color=#FFFF00>We've got to go home.</font>

995
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:38,285
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet and duck down.</font>

996
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:57,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

997
01:04:58,085 --> 01:05:00,855
<font color=#FFFF00>Are we safe now, Seong Hoon?</font>

998
01:05:02,355 --> 01:05:04,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home.</font>

999
01:05:04,425 --> 01:05:05,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Hee Sook.</font>

1000
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,085
<font color=#FFFF00>Well done.</font>

1001
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:08,525
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go in.</font>

1002
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:13,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I'm so tired.</font>

1003
01:05:13,885 --> 01:05:15,785
<font color=#FFFF00>- It's Han Seong Sik. - That's Han Seong Sik!</font>

1004
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,225
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh my goodness. - Wait!</font>

1005
01:05:18,225 --> 01:05:19,755
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop! - What are you doing?</font>

1006
01:05:19,755 --> 01:05:21,355
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that you illegally counselled...</font>

1007
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:23,585
<font color=#FFFF00>Seonghan Group to be nominated to Minjeong Party?</font>

1008
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:24,885
<font color=#FFFF00>No, it's not.</font>

1009
01:05:24,885 --> 01:05:26,755
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really play a role as a broker...</font>

1010
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:28,355
<font color=#FFFF00>for Minjeong Party and Seonghan Group?</font>

1011
01:05:28,355 --> 01:05:30,725
<font color=#FFFF00>No, he didn't. Don't do this.</font>

1012
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:32,725
<font color=#FFFF00>- He doesn't know anything. - Come, Seong Sik.</font>

1013
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:34,555
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop it already. - Are you having an affair...</font>

1014
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,025
<font color=#FFFF00>with Jang Yoo Ra, the news anchor?</font>

1015
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:42,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that you bribed an official for Jang Yoo Ra?</font>

1016
01:05:42,485 --> 01:05:45,355
<font color=#FFFF00>How is she related to your illegal counselling?</font>

1017
01:05:46,055 --> 01:05:47,885
<font color=#FFFF00>What are they talking about?</font>

1018
01:05:48,025 --> 01:05:50,025
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. I don't know anything about this.</font>

1019
01:05:50,125 --> 01:05:52,225
<font color=#FFFF00>I really don't know.</font>

1020
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,155
<font color=#FFFF00>You are...</font>

1021
01:05:56,225 --> 01:05:57,385
<font color=#FFFF00>having an affair with her?</font>

1022
01:05:57,555 --> 01:05:59,325
<font color=#FFFF00>What are they talking about?</font>

1023
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:01,855
<font color=#FFFF00>What's your relationship with Jang Yoo Ra?</font>

1024
01:06:02,085 --> 01:06:03,125
<font color=#FFFF00>Just die.</font>

1025
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:06,425
<font color=#FFFF00>Die! Why don't you just die?</font>

1026
01:06:06,555 --> 01:06:09,925
<font color=#FFFF00>- My goodness, you brat. - Die!</font>

1027
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,955
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

1028
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:14,625
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

1029
01:06:15,655 --> 01:06:17,725
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

1030
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,085
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

1031
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:14,155
