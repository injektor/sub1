1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Your name is Lee Hyun Woo. You graduated Seoin Elementary School.</font>

2
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:12,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Your brother Lee Sang Woo always waited for you...</font>

3
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:14,497
<font color=#FFFF00>in the schoolyard until you got dismissed.</font>

4
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>You were a good student who was kind and polite.</font>

5
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,627
<font color=#FFFF00>He adored his little brother very much.</font>

6
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:23,367
<font color=#FFFF00>After his father who used to drive a school bus wrongfully died,</font>

7
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,027
<font color=#FFFF00>he and his brother were sent to an orphanage.</font>

8
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:29,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo was adopted, and his little brother went missing.</font>

9
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,427
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing right now?</font>

10
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:35,037
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a story about a man I know.</font>

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,927
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, that Lee Hyun Woo guy...</font>

12
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,467
<font color=#FFFF00>moved to our town six months ago.</font>

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,227
<font color=#FFFF00>And he happened to live...</font>

14
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:48,797
<font color=#FFFF00>right across from the man who was related to his father's death.</font>

15
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:52,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come here?</font>

16
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you come to take revenge?</font>

17
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:04,927
<font color=#FFFF00>This is really funny.</font>

18
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,737
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you've finished reading that lousy romance novel.</font>

19
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you're writing a detective story.</font>

20
00:01:11,997 --> 00:01:14,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop being sarcastic and just answer my questions.</font>

21
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:16,127
<font color=#FFFF00>So what's next?</font>

22
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:21,167
<font color=#FFFF00>So that Hyun Woo returned to the town he lived...</font>

23
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:24,427
<font color=#FFFF00>and dated Jeong Eun and walked away to take revenge for his father?</font>

24
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:27,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying you were dumped for nothing...</font>

25
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:28,827
<font color=#FFFF00>but revenge?</font>

26
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,827
<font color=#FFFF00>If that sounds to be an acceptable reason for our breakup,</font>

27
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,167
<font color=#FFFF00>you can think that way.</font>

28
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:38,767
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I want to say to you.</font>

29
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,227
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I haven't accepted the fact...</font>

30
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,227
<font color=#FFFF00>we broke up.</font>

31
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:48,567
<font color=#FFFF00>But you should know that I'm not here to beg and plead for your love.</font>

32
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:51,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? That's not the real issue.</font>

33
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:53,867
<font color=#FFFF00>You're in a more terrible fix.</font>

34
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:57,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's the issue? - You should give up...</font>

35
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,397
<font color=#FFFF00>on the revenge.</font>

36
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:05,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what you've done, and what you're about to do.</font>

37
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:06,997
<font color=#FFFF00>But stop it.</font>

38
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm begging you.</font>

39
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't, Hyun Woo.</font>

40
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:14,667
<font color=#FFFF00>You might put yourself in danger instead.</font>

41
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:17,637
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun,</font>

42
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:22,297
<font color=#FFFF00>the first impression I've got from you turned to be right.</font>

43
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:25,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Women who poke their nose into everything, make reckless guesses,</font>

44
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,327
<font color=#FFFF00>and speak what's on their mind without thinking just like you.</font>

45
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:30,497
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the type I hate the most.</font>

46
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:35,027
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hyun Woo... - Let me tell you why I left you.</font>

47
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:37,297
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the reason.</font>

48
00:02:37,697 --> 00:02:41,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Your such thoughtless behaviors put me under a lot of stress.</font>

49
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:44,527
<font color=#FFFF00>But I tried to be nice to you until the last moment.</font>

50
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to stop here.</font>

51
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you're a detective or something?</font>

52
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know anything about me?</font>

53
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you've written a novel by yourself...</font>

54
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,267
<font color=#FFFF00>with what I've told you before.</font>

55
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:59,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I seriously need you to stop this.</font>

56
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,627
<font color=#FFFF00>You're making sick of you.</font>

57
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:32,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

58
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,327
<font color=#FFFF00>We've met before.</font>

59
00:03:42,397 --> 00:03:46,267
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have we? - Aren't you Anchor Han Jeong Hwa?</font>

60
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,297
<font color=#FFFF00>- Do you know me? - Of course.</font>

61
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,767
<font color=#FFFF00>There was a time when every man in Korea knew you.</font>

62
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:01,567
<font color=#FFFF00>- I see. - Wait. I'm not done talking yet!</font>

63
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:12,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

64
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:17,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you spare me some time later?</font>

65
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:19,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to have dinner with you.</font>

66
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

67
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:23,997
<font color=#FFFF00>See you later.</font>

68
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:47,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Hwa. - Do you know him?</font>

69
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:54,067
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, why are you coming out of this house?</font>

70
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:57,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... It is because...</font>

71
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I delivered coffee.</font>

72
00:05:01,497 --> 00:05:02,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

73
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Hwa. - Right!</font>

74
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go meet my anchor friends.</font>

75
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:08,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to be a little late.</font>

76
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,997
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's okay with you, please watch Ye Bin.</font>

77
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa! Jeong Hwa!</font>

78
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,997
<font color=#FFFF00>What is happening?</font>

79
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,467
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be happening.</font>

80
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:32,097
<font color=#FFFF00>You met such an unusual girl.</font>

81
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you talking about Han Jeong Hwa?</font>

82
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm referring to Han Jeong Eun.</font>

83
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:44,567
<font color=#FFFF00>She managed to get very close to your secret.</font>

84
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:48,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I think we should finish our business here soon.</font>

85
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:52,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

86
00:05:53,627 --> 00:05:54,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's get it done quickly.</font>

87
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,527
<font color=#FFFF00>It's very tough for me,</font>

88
00:05:58,367 --> 00:05:59,597
<font color=#FFFF00>and I am exhausted.</font>

89
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:07,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, my one and only granddaughter is getting divorced.</font>

90
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:09,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

91
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:14,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I should wear this on my head and stay in bed.</font>

92
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:16,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I should put on a show.</font>

93
00:06:17,397 --> 00:06:20,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, they will stop this nonsense.</font>

94
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:26,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Elizabeth.</font>

95
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:28,797
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong, Elizabeth? Goodness.</font>

96
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,767
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

97
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Elizabeth.</font>

98
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,367
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

99
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying?</font>

100
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, dear.</font>

101
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry too much about Jeong Hwa.</font>

102
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I will talk to her.</font>

103
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you talk to James?</font>

104
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,067
<font color=#FFFF00>He wasn't picking up his phone.</font>

105
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

106
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,597
<font color=#FFFF00>What will we do?</font>

107
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,397
<font color=#FFFF00>We are about to have a divorcee in our family.</font>

108
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you say that?</font>

109
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:25,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do everything to stop her.</font>

110
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:29,297
<font color=#FFFF00>She even packed up and moved to Korea. How can we stop her?</font>

111
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:32,967
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because you've been...</font>

112
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,967
<font color=#FFFF00>favoring Jeong Hwa since she was little.</font>

113
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,867
<font color=#FFFF00>She never listens to what we say.</font>

114
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,427
<font color=#FFFF00>It breaks my heart.</font>

115
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Both Seong Sik and Jeong Hwa...</font>

116
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,497
<font color=#FFFF00>are more like enemies than my own children.</font>

117
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:50,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on and eat some.</font>

118
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,667
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

119
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:54,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even have the strength to eat porridge.</font>

120
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I talk to you for a while?</font>

121
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,467
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

122
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:32,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Huh?</font>

123
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

124
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui's script didn't get selected.</font>

125
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you spent the night together?</font>

126
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if things didn't go well with her work,</font>

127
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:47,297
<font color=#FFFF00>you shouldn't have done this. This is just unbelievable.</font>

128
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:49,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

129
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:51,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui was really disheartened.</font>

130
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:53,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, I can't believe this.</font>

131
00:08:58,097 --> 00:08:59,427
<font color=#FFFF00>So where on earth...</font>

132
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:02,067
<font color=#FFFF00>did you two go?</font>

133
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,267
<font color=#FFFF00>We were at a library.</font>

134
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:05,427
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

135
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:06,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

136
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Both Dong Hui and you...</font>

137
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,867
<font color=#FFFF00>are unbelievable.</font>

138
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everyone who makes dramas as strange as you two?</font>

139
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that you work together and that you are in-laws,</font>

140
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,067
<font color=#FFFF00>but before that, you are a man and a woman.</font>

141
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,727
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you stay the night together?</font>

142
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if Dong Hui was struggling,</font>

143
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,397
<font color=#FFFF00>you should've brought her home.</font>

144
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Do Mother and Father know about this too?</font>

145
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,497
<font color=#FFFF00>No, they don't know this.</font>

146
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:40,167
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you, Seong Joon?</font>

147
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,227
<font color=#FFFF00>This is very unlike you.</font>

148
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:52,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Is there something you want to tell me?</font>

149
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,537
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

150
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,467
<font color=#FFFF00>We shouldn't have done it.</font>

151
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

152
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, stop. Stop.</font>

153
00:10:40,537 --> 00:10:43,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, what did your teacher say about this song...</font>

154
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,627
<font color=#FFFF00>during the last lesson?</font>

155
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,127
<font color=#FFFF00>"Though Not Deserving".</font>

156
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:50,267
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. "Sebben, Crudele".</font>

157
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>"Though Not Deserving".</font>

158
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:56,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you don't deserve her,</font>

159
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:58,267
<font color=#FFFF00>you will still love her.</font>

160
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:00,367
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what the song is about, isn't it?</font>

161
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - How should you sing it then?</font>

162
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:05,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You should sing it more sorrowfully.</font>

163
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:07,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

164
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:10,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Your lover doesn't love you.</font>

165
00:11:10,097 --> 00:11:12,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Cruelly, she refused your love.</font>

166
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:15,767
<font color=#FFFF00>But you still love her.</font>

167
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,267
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to keep loving her.</font>

168
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:20,567
<font color=#FFFF00>How tragic is that?</font>

169
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,967
<font color=#FFFF00>How should you sing it then?</font>

170
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:23,967
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to...</font>

171
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:27,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to be more emotional. Right?</font>

172
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,267
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Right.</font>

173
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Now...</font>

174
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:33,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going?</font>

175
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to my home. Why?</font>

176
00:11:36,967 --> 00:11:38,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Then listen to Chang Soo's song before you go.</font>

177
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:41,927
<font color=#FFFF00>No, thanks. You should take care of your son.</font>

178
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

179
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:47,067
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did you just call me Aunt? - If you keep doing that to me,</font>

180
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:50,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not going to visit you when I win a cash prize at a competition.</font>

181
00:11:50,397 --> 00:11:51,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

182
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:53,767
<font color=#FFFF00>When you win that prize,</font>

183
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>you should treat your mother.</font>

184
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:59,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop bothering your aunt. Okay?</font>

185
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:01,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Bye, Teacher.</font>

186
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,867
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't have affection for her kids.</font>

187
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:14,167
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why she's bad at bringing up her children.</font>

188
00:12:14,997 --> 00:12:17,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, don't mind her. Just focus on your singing.</font>

189
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Should we restart from the next bar?</font>

190
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,597
<font color=#FFFF00>- Please play the piano. - Okay.</font>

191
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:23,997
<font color=#FFFF00>- I got it. - Okay.</font>

192
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Uncle.</font>

193
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:35,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

194
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:37,527
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it, Ah In?</font>

195
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to call Yoo Ra?</font>

196
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:47,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Yoo Ra? Who is that?</font>

197
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:49,397
<font color=#FFFF00>My friend Yoo Ra.</font>

198
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:52,367
<font color=#FFFF00>You talked to her in the restroom the other time.</font>

199
00:12:52,997 --> 00:12:55,167
<font color=#FFFF00>She's...</font>

200
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:57,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- She's no one... - Dad.</font>

201
00:12:58,167 --> 00:12:59,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop now.</font>

202
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop what?</font>

203
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I've read everything on the internet.</font>

204
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:06,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

205
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:11,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Who told you to read things on the internet?</font>

206
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:12,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever. Just stop.</font>

207
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

208
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,197
<font color=#FFFF00>thank you.</font>

209
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You are the best, Ah In.</font>

210
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:24,427
<font color=#FFFF00>You're welcome.</font>

211
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,397
<font color=#FFFF00>What have you been thinking about?</font>

212
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thinking...</font>

213
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,427
<font color=#FFFF00>maybe I should marry off Dong Hui.</font>

214
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:54,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui?</font>

215
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

216
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:59,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know any good man?</font>

217
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want me to introduce her to a journalist?</font>

218
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:07,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, no thanks.</font>

219
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:12,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I was thinking...</font>

220
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:16,127
<font color=#FFFF00>maybe I should start another business.</font>

221
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:17,727
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

222
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:21,267
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to marry off Dong Hui.</font>

223
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,697
<font color=#FFFF00>And I am partially responsible for what happened to Seong Sik.</font>

224
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,627
<font color=#FFFF00>And even Jeong Hwa is causing trouble.</font>

225
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:31,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel so frustrated these days.</font>

226
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:32,267
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

227
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,697
<font color=#FFFF00>The idea I have...</font>

228
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:39,067
<font color=#FFFF00>is very innovative.</font>

229
00:14:39,827 --> 00:14:40,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, honey.</font>

230
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:43,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, Mr. Han Seong Hoon!</font>

231
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:46,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, you surprised me. Why did you shout?</font>

232
00:14:47,697 --> 00:14:50,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop the nonsense...</font>

233
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,667
<font color=#FFFF00>and just run your fried chicken restaurant diligently.</font>

234
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:55,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Do that. Okay?</font>

235
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:57,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, that business idea is...</font>

236
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know. Stop it.</font>

237
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:00,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Go away.</font>

238
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:04,467
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo. - I said, go away!</font>

239
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:07,097
<font color=#FFFF00>We haven't seen each other in seven years.</font>

240
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,627
<font color=#FFFF00>We're here together now because we stayed in touch.</font>

241
00:15:11,097 --> 00:15:14,427
<font color=#FFFF00>It's already very popular in Russia and China.</font>

242
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>You can see how popular it is if you search it on the internet.</font>

243
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I already searched the website you told me about on the internet.</font>

244
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Like you said, it's very popular indeed.</font>

245
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:25,767
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

246
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,827
<font color=#FFFF00>It has dolphins, seals, and walruses.</font>

247
00:15:32,027 --> 00:15:33,627
<font color=#FFFF00>But the main reason...</font>

248
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,527
<font color=#FFFF00>for its popularity is because it's a theme park with many penguins.</font>

249
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:45,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how much people love cute animals in Korea.</font>

250
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:48,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take a look.</font>

251
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:56,127
<font color=#FFFF00>(The center of culture and leisure)</font>

252
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:02,697
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't changed at all.</font>

253
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,927
<font color=#FFFF00>The one who hasn't changed is you, not us.</font>

254
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,627
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right. You haven't aged a bit.</font>

255
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:11,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess it's because you married a guy from an amazing family.</font>

256
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,867
<font color=#FFFF00>- They're not amazing. - Hey.</font>

257
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Your father-in-law is one of the richest people in Hong Kong,</font>

258
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:19,467
<font color=#FFFF00>and your husband is an international lawyer.</font>

259
00:16:19,597 --> 00:16:23,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. That's why there was a rumor that you married him for money.</font>

260
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,467
<font color=#FFFF00>It's fine.</font>

261
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:29,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether you marry a guy for money or love,</font>

262
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:32,327
<font color=#FFFF00>all you care about is money after seven years of marriage.</font>

263
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? It's because you have to raise your child.</font>

264
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:38,367
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. She has a point.</font>

265
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,897
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a place where families can have a meal.</font>

266
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:50,867
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you looking at? Do you know him?</font>

267
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:54,167
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It's nothing.</font>

268
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:58,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, tell us about your husband.</font>

269
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:00,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he still a romantic?</font>

270
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,067
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not sure. - Look.</font>

271
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:06,267
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not so great to have a romantic husband.</font>

272
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,367
<font color=#FFFF00>He also does romantic things to other women too.</font>

273
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:11,627
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about Yoo Mi Na.</font>

274
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,497
<font color=#FFFF00>She also married a guy as successful as your husband.</font>

275
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:17,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you remember how much she bragged about her romantic husband?</font>

276
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:21,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Her husband is having an affair and living with his mistress now.</font>

277
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:23,867
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh, my. Really? - Yes.</font>

278
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:27,597
<font color=#FFFF00>They had been separated for a year. Now they're filing for a divorce.</font>

279
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's meet again when you have...</font>

280
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:33,767
<font color=#FFFF00>details about the budget and investment costs.</font>

281
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I will call you in a few days.</font>

282
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,897
<font color=#FFFF00>He's an amazing swindler.</font>

283
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:51,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... I liked how he seemed professional.</font>

284
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Sometimes you can be...</font>

285
00:17:55,027 --> 00:17:56,627
<font color=#FFFF00>quite mischievous.</font>

286
00:18:08,697 --> 00:18:09,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Cheers.</font>

287
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:27,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we split the check?</font>

288
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:31,167
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? You don't have to. It's on me.</font>

289
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am. Your bill has already been settled.</font>

290
00:18:34,927 --> 00:18:37,867
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me? - He already made the payment.</font>

291
00:18:39,927 --> 00:18:42,527
<font color=#FFFF00>"President of Golden Street, David Lee".</font>

292
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, my. Maybe it's the guy who was here earlier.</font>

293
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:49,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Golden Street? Isn't that an investment company on Wall Street?</font>

294
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:51,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Really? Jeong Hwa.</font>

295
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:53,697
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you know him?</font>

296
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:56,927
<font color=#FFFF00>You always get the nicest guys.</font>

297
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,597
<font color=#FFFF00>He's just a good neighbor.</font>

298
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

299
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:24,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I see you for a second?</font>

300
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:28,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on in. Please have a seat.</font>

301
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:49,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's better to have just one writer.</font>

302
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

303
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:58,967
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying we shouldn't have Dong Hui as the co-writer.</font>

304
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:02,567
<font color=#FFFF00>- President Lee. - A TV show is also a product.</font>

305
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,927
<font color=#FFFF00>If there is a broken part, we should replace it quickly.</font>

306
00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:09,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui and Writer Choi have a big difference in ability.</font>

307
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:12,237
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, everyone chose Writer Choi's script...</font>

308
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,427
<font color=#FFFF00>for the 1st and 2nd episode.</font>

309
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:18,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's unlikely that Dong Hui will turn things around later on.</font>

310
00:20:18,627 --> 00:20:22,027
<font color=#FFFF00>She couldn't have written her script without Dong Hui's synopsis.</font>

311
00:20:22,127 --> 00:20:25,367
<font color=#FFFF00>They both signed the contract as co-writers as well.</font>

312
00:20:29,237 --> 00:20:32,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Pay Dong Hui compensation for breach of contract.</font>

313
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:35,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe it will be more efficient way to save...</font>

314
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:37,567
<font color=#FFFF00>both money and time.</font>

315
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:41,267
<font color=#FFFF00>- President Lee. - Why are you being so emotional?</font>

316
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:43,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand why.</font>

317
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't say anything to upset you.</font>

318
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:48,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm making this decision...</font>

319
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:51,597
<font color=#FFFF00>solely based on the business perspective.</font>

320
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:01,967
<font color=#FFFF00>I just...</font>

321
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:05,297
<font color=#FFFF00>don't understand why you're doing this.</font>

322
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:08,827
<font color=#FFFF00>When you suddenly came to us to invest in our drama,</font>

323
00:21:09,127 --> 00:21:10,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought you were being kind.</font>

324
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I was surprised to see you treat me kindly when I was hostile to you...</font>

325
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:18,097
<font color=#FFFF00>thinking that you were approaching my family for a wrong reason.</font>

326
00:21:19,927 --> 00:21:21,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you?</font>

327
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I was.</font>

328
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:27,027
<font color=#FFFF00>But now I'm not sure anymore.</font>

329
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:31,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know why you invested in our show and did me a favor.</font>

330
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:34,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe you were just pretending.</font>

331
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:37,737
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand why you keep trying...</font>

332
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,297
<font color=#FFFF00>to make me suffer.</font>

333
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:46,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't understand why such a clever man like you...</font>

334
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,597
<font color=#FFFF00>became so emotional.</font>

335
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:54,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really like the way your company works,</font>

336
00:21:55,467 --> 00:21:59,067
<font color=#FFFF00>but there is one thing that President Bang and I agree on.</font>

337
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what it is?</font>

338
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:06,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Never run your business as a charity.</font>

339
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:10,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm a renowned investor.</font>

340
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:12,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you haven't forgotten it.</font>

341
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:17,327
<font color=#FFFF00>So you should exclude your girlfriend...</font>

342
00:22:18,527 --> 00:22:20,627
<font color=#FFFF00>from this project as soon as possible.</font>

343
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:23,427
<font color=#FFFF00>That's the wise thing for you to do.</font>

344
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,197
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you okay? - Yes. I'm fine.</font>

345
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:41,697
<font color=#FFFF00>You must've gotten scolded a lot because of me.</font>

346
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... I just got a few slaps and scoldings.</font>

347
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:47,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you get slapped?</font>

348
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:50,567
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

349
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I still don't regret it.</font>

350
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,167
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

351
00:22:57,597 --> 00:23:00,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't regret that we were together that night.</font>

352
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:07,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not going to change your mind again, are you?</font>

353
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:09,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Answer me.</font>

354
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:14,897
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I'm not going to change my mind again.</font>

355
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay then.</font>

356
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,827
<font color=#FFFF00>My sister and husband are only causing me trouble.</font>

357
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:25,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd better...</font>

358
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:28,067
<font color=#FFFF00>discipline them more strictly.</font>

359
00:23:37,297 --> 00:23:40,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to work hard to write a good script.</font>

360
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:44,267
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to beat Writer Choi's script for the 3rd and 4th episode.</font>

361
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:47,467
<font color=#FFFF00>You should.</font>

362
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:50,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you look unhappy?</font>

363
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:52,697
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

364
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,467
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

365
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:58,127
<font color=#FFFF00>I said it's nothing.</font>

366
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:02,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. You're making me worry. Are you going to keep doing this?</font>

367
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:03,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you?</font>

368
00:24:04,797 --> 00:24:08,197
<font color=#FFFF00>- It hurts. - Lighten up, okay?</font>

369
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,967
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been scolded all day, but I'm still smiling.</font>

370
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You look so pretty.</font>

371
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:19,727
<font color=#FFFF00>So pretty.</font>

372
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

373
00:24:24,327 --> 00:24:26,367
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're hurting me. - Okay.</font>

374
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,427
<font color=#FFFF00>This is driving me crazy.</font>

375
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:38,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I was too busy with my work that I neglected them for too long.</font>

376
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,197
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

377
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi. Come here.</font>

378
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad you came. Hey.</font>

379
00:24:47,497 --> 00:24:50,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi. What's the matter with you?</font>

380
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:53,267
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you let this happen?</font>

381
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

382
00:24:56,397 --> 00:24:59,367
<font color=#FFFF00>How involved are they?</font>

383
00:25:00,427 --> 00:25:03,827
<font color=#FFFF00>They haven't gone too far, have they?</font>

384
00:25:04,767 --> 00:25:08,627
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've stopped them by any means.</font>

385
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:10,667
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

386
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,467
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do with you?</font>

387
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, Moong Chi.</font>

388
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's not your fault.</font>

389
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:21,097
<font color=#FFFF00>They're young,</font>

390
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,067
<font color=#FFFF00>and we shouldn't have moved in.</font>

391
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,067
<font color=#FFFF00>What should I do?</font>

392
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, tell me what I should do.</font>

393
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:31,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Come here, Moong Chi.</font>

394
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:33,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what to do with them.</font>

395
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:36,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Are you out of mind?</font>

396
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:38,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'd let you take Ye Bin away from me?</font>

397
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she trying to take Ye Bin away?</font>

398
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:42,397
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

399
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:44,467
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

400
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:46,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You such a jerk!</font>

401
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:48,467
<font color=#FFFF00>You had lost your head over another wench...</font>

402
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,667
<font color=#FFFF00>and neglected Ye Bin so far!</font>

403
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:52,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you want the custody now?</font>

404
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh boy. What is...</font>

405
00:25:56,327 --> 00:25:58,127
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - What on earth is happening?</font>

406
00:25:58,297 --> 00:25:59,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

407
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I know it's your mother who told you to bring Ye Bin back.</font>

408
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:04,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop talking about your mother. I'm fed up with her!</font>

409
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,827
<font color=#FFFF00>When you cheated on me,</font>

410
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:09,127
<font color=#FFFF00>your mother sided with you.</font>

411
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:10,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

412
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,127
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandma. - Come here.</font>

413
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it already. What time do you think it is? Give it to me.</font>

414
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:22,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Give it back to me.</font>

415
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:24,797
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll kill that jerk.</font>

416
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,197
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a piece of trash.</font>

417
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:29,127
<font color=#FFFF00>He's nothing but a scum, Dad.</font>

418
00:26:30,227 --> 00:26:32,297
<font color=#FFFF00>James, this is me.</font>

419
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:35,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know how late it is here?</font>

420
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:36,967
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

421
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:40,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care what time it is there. This isn't right.</font>

422
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:41,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Ask him...</font>

423
00:26:42,027 --> 00:26:44,297
<font color=#FFFF00>why we haven't been able to reach him.</font>

424
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:45,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really not know why?</font>

425
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:48,427
<font color=#FFFF00>He couldn't contact us because he knew how shameful it is.</font>

426
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:50,397
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he answer your calls...</font>

427
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:53,127
<font color=#FFFF00>when he cheated on me and lived with another woman for three years?</font>

428
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:54,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay quiet.</font>

429
00:26:57,167 --> 00:26:58,167
<font color=#FFFF00>James,</font>

430
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,267
<font color=#FFFF00>let's call it a day.</font>

431
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:03,967
<font color=#FFFF00>But I'll call you tomorrow. Make sure to answer it.</font>

432
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, Ye Bin is here with her.</font>

433
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,527
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've been more careful.</font>

434
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine!</font>

435
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:13,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop crying now.</font>

436
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,997
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you crying so loud for?</font>

437
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,627
<font color=#FFFF00>This is breaking my heart.</font>

438
00:27:24,567 --> 00:27:27,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Ye Bin, you should sleep next to me. Come here.</font>

439
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:30,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

440
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:33,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Ye Bin's dad is...</font>

441
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:34,997
<font color=#FFFF00>seeing another woman.</font>

442
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,527
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been more than three years.</font>

443
00:27:37,527 --> 00:27:39,897
<font color=#FFFF00>And we've been estranged for about two years.</font>

444
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,897
<font color=#FFFF00>So how could I stay there any longer?</font>

445
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,027
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so humiliating.</font>

446
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:51,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I understand.</font>

447
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Still...</font>

448
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

449
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure I'll win the divorce suit.</font>

450
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:01,367
<font color=#FFFF00>It's him who caused us to get divorced.</font>

451
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:03,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa,</font>

452
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,227
<font color=#FFFF00>is it your turn this time?</font>

453
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:10,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad and I...</font>

454
00:28:11,127 --> 00:28:13,597
<font color=#FFFF00>cannot feel at ease for a day because of our children.</font>

455
00:28:15,397 --> 00:28:17,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm utterly exhausted now, Jeong Hwa.</font>

456
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:35,727
<font color=#FFFF00>So?</font>

457
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,667
<font color=#FFFF00>That's all.</font>

458
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,597
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what happened.</font>

459
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:42,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Is James insane?</font>

460
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,897
<font color=#FFFF00>He seemed to be willing...</font>

461
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:48,427
<font color=#FFFF00>to give her everything he had when he married her.</font>

462
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,497
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he do this to her?</font>

463
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what all guys are like, you know.</font>

464
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:54,127
<font color=#FFFF00>So what is Jeong Ae doing?</font>

465
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>She got an IV at a clinic and fell asleep now.</font>

466
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:00,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought Seong Sik's problem is finally settled.</font>

467
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:04,127
<font color=#FFFF00>And it happened again.</font>

468
00:29:04,227 --> 00:29:05,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Jeong Hwa?</font>

469
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,127
<font color=#FFFF00>She shut herself in her room.</font>

470
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,367
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is this?</font>

471
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:13,567
<font color=#FFFF00>It's from smoke into smother.</font>

472
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:17,567
<font color=#FFFF00>You know how disturbed I am. Please just leave.</font>

473
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:18,727
<font color=#FFFF00>To where?</font>

474
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:19,897
<font color=#FFFF00>To the third floor.</font>

475
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:21,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't.</font>

476
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:23,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Why not?</font>

477
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:26,167
<font color=#FFFF00>There had been a big fuss because of Dong Hui the other day.</font>

478
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Elizabeth cried so loudly.</font>

479
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:32,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of Dong Hui? What happened to her?</font>

480
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:34,127
<font color=#FFFF00>She slept out.</font>

481
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:36,497
<font color=#FFFF00>- She slept out? - Yes.</font>

482
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,467
<font color=#FFFF00>So Elizabeth gave her a good beating,</font>

483
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,997
<font color=#FFFF00>even Hye Joo scolded her severely.</font>

484
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,667
<font color=#FFFF00>It must have been chaotic.</font>

485
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,327
<font color=#FFFF00>They kept it a secret from us.</font>

486
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe that Dong Hui slept out.</font>

487
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:52,927
<font color=#FFFF00>So that family is in a terrible mess too.</font>

488
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:55,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui keeps apologizing,</font>

489
00:29:55,397 --> 00:29:56,927
<font color=#FFFF00>but Elizabeth doesn't bat an eye.</font>

490
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

491
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:02,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you stay on the first floor then?</font>

492
00:30:02,497 --> 00:30:05,067
<font color=#FFFF00>If you run into Jeong Hwa, you'll feel even more perturbed.</font>

493
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,167
<font color=#FFFF00>But Chang Soo is singing loudly there.</font>

494
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:11,897
<font color=#FFFF00>He sings all day long. It's too loud for me to stand.</font>

495
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:14,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I can even hear him singing on the third floor.</font>

496
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:15,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear me.</font>

497
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear me.</font>

498
00:30:18,327 --> 00:30:20,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma, I'm sorry.</font>

499
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,397
<font color=#FFFF00>It won't happen again.</font>

500
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me.</font>

501
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:30,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

502
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:33,667
<font color=#FFFF00>please don't tell me to leave you.</font>

503
00:30:34,827 --> 00:30:36,297
<font color=#FFFF00>That makes me really sad.</font>

504
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:39,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no one else than you.</font>

505
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:41,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't say that.</font>

506
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,597
<font color=#FFFF00>You are...</font>

507
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:48,667
<font color=#FFFF00>all I have.</font>

508
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:57,427
<font color=#FFFF00>I will work hard today as I did.</font>

509
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:00,027
<font color=#FFFF00>So please forgive me.</font>

510
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I will see you after work.</font>

511
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:08,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll come home early.</font>

512
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Have some.</font>

513
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:46,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not ill.</font>

514
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:48,567
<font color=#FFFF00>I just lost my appetite.</font>

515
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:51,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying you should eat some porridge.</font>

516
00:31:51,267 --> 00:31:53,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you don't eat, it won't solve anything.</font>

517
00:32:03,327 --> 00:32:04,427
<font color=#FFFF00>How is your grandmother?</font>

518
00:32:06,397 --> 00:32:08,827
<font color=#FFFF00>She doesn't even look at me.</font>

519
00:32:11,227 --> 00:32:14,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Please cheer up. This, too, shall pass away.</font>

520
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. So I'll finish the next two episodes...</font>

521
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:18,567
<font color=#FFFF00>by the end of this week.</font>

522
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,697
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

523
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing.</font>

524
00:32:29,627 --> 00:32:30,627
<font color=#FFFF00>You look beautiful.</font>

525
00:32:31,127 --> 00:32:33,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You look better when you're energetic.</font>

526
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:37,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. That's what makes me charming.</font>

527
00:32:40,397 --> 00:32:41,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Dig in.</font>

528
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:46,227
<font color=#FFFF00>But I don't feel like eating porridge.</font>

529
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:13,967
<font color=#FFFF00>How adorable.</font>

530
00:33:14,597 --> 00:33:16,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop. We're not far from our office.</font>

531
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,467
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be fired if they see us.</font>

532
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

533
00:33:19,997 --> 00:33:22,567
<font color=#FFFF00>- How cute. - I said cut it out.</font>

534
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to be mad at you.</font>

535
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,827
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't scare me at all.</font>

536
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,267
<font color=#FFFF00>You have something on your face like a little kid.</font>

537
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:34,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat up.</font>

538
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,767
<font color=#FFFF00>It's tasty.</font>

539
00:34:00,597 --> 00:34:01,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop, Chang Soo.</font>

540
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:06,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Teacher, I guess this is all for today.</font>

541
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:09,427
<font color=#FFFF00>See you later. Take care.</font>

542
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:23,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

543
00:34:24,367 --> 00:34:25,497
<font color=#FFFF00>are you angry?</font>

544
00:34:25,727 --> 00:34:26,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not.</font>

545
00:34:28,497 --> 00:34:29,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

546
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,097
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

547
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,267
<font color=#FFFF00>not your issue.</font>

548
00:34:34,797 --> 00:34:35,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

549
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:37,427
<font color=#FFFF00>We need a new instructor.</font>

550
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:41,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- You mean the instrumental teacher? - No,</font>

551
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:45,067
<font color=#FFFF00>we need a new vocal teacher.</font>

552
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:47,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen, Chang Soo.</font>

553
00:34:48,137 --> 00:34:50,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Learning from a good instructor matters the most...</font>

554
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:51,637
<font color=#FFFF00>for vocal music students.</font>

555
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

556
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:56,027
<font color=#FFFF00>we should invite a new teacher.</font>

557
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:57,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Who?</font>

558
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:27,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't seem to put the pieces together.</font>

559
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Someone is definitely lying.</font>

560
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,927
<font color=#FFFF00>It's driving me crazy.</font>

561
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:50,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

562
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:57,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, my dear daughter. How have you been?</font>

563
00:35:58,897 --> 00:35:59,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you been well?</font>

564
00:36:01,097 --> 00:36:04,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I have been well. Aren't you busy though, Dad?</font>

565
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I am busy,</font>

566
00:36:07,397 --> 00:36:10,067
<font color=#FFFF00>but I came here to give you a present.</font>

567
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,967
<font color=#FFFF00>A present?</font>

568
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:15,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like it?</font>

569
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:18,137
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad!</font>

570
00:36:20,267 --> 00:36:23,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go. This is a shot of espresso you like.</font>

571
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

572
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:31,567
<font color=#FFFF00>I noticed that you didn't have a car given your age.</font>

573
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I used up all my money when I went to meet you.</font>

574
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:39,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about that and...</font>

575
00:36:40,727 --> 00:36:42,827
<font color=#FFFF00>thank you for accepting me without giving me a hard time...</font>

576
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,097
<font color=#FFFF00>although I was away for 30 years.</font>

577
00:36:46,767 --> 00:36:47,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

578
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:51,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say such things. I told you I am not angry at you.</font>

579
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:56,367
<font color=#FFFF00>We can talk more later when we have time.</font>

580
00:36:57,227 --> 00:36:58,467
<font color=#FFFF00>See that car over there?</font>

581
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:01,427
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - You should...</font>

582
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,927
<font color=#FFFF00>take that car and bring your mother to my concert. Okay?</font>

583
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:09,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. You're not giving it to me.</font>

584
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:11,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it to drive around Mom?</font>

585
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:13,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you. Since you take after Ae Ri,</font>

586
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:16,637
<font color=#FFFF00>you are quite smart.</font>

587
00:37:17,137 --> 00:37:18,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

588
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:23,267
<font color=#FFFF00>I really love Ae Ri.</font>

589
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:27,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't forgotten about her for the last 30 years,</font>

590
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,967
<font color=#FFFF00>but I...</font>

591
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:34,027
<font color=#FFFF00>might have loved you more than your mother.</font>

592
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,597
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I really want to show her...</font>

593
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:38,567
<font color=#FFFF00>how much...</font>

594
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:41,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I loved her while I was away...</font>

595
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,527
<font color=#FFFF00>and how hard I worked.</font>

596
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:48,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if I do, perhaps, her anger might subside.</font>

597
00:37:50,497 --> 00:37:53,137
<font color=#FFFF00>- All right. - You understand me, right?</font>

598
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:55,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I do.</font>

599
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:57,997
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. Thank you.</font>

600
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. Don't worry. I will be at your concert for certain.</font>

601
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:07,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Bye.</font>

602
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:11,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Drive carefully.</font>

603
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,467
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>(Seoul Detention Center)</font>

605
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,897
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ms. Yoon. - Jeong Eun.</font>

606
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,467
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

607
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:46,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard what happened, but I'd have never guessed you'd end up here.</font>

608
00:38:47,897 --> 00:38:50,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know either.</font>

609
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:06,097
<font color=#FFFF00>This is all part of my karma.</font>

610
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:11,527
<font color=#FFFF00>But no one lives in Korea without committing a single illegal act.</font>

611
00:39:12,597 --> 00:39:14,427
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are unlucky, you get caught.</font>

612
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:18,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Yoon. To be frank,</font>

613
00:39:19,427 --> 00:39:22,637
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to talk about the person who put you here.</font>

614
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:25,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Who do you mean?</font>

615
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean Mr. Lee.</font>

616
00:39:30,697 --> 00:39:31,797
<font color=#FFFF00>His name is Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

617
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:34,527
<font color=#FFFF00>What about him?</font>

618
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:37,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard everything.</font>

619
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:42,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the rumors and what you said.</font>

620
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:44,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I also checked on my own.</font>

621
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:48,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee is the son of the driver, right?</font>

622
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:53,137
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. He is.</font>

623
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,097
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth happened 23 years ago?</font>

624
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:07,697
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is...</font>

625
00:40:08,327 --> 00:40:10,767
<font color=#FFFF00>the driver was innocent.</font>

626
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,367
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

627
00:40:13,267 --> 00:40:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>The accident happened because Guem Ja's bus brakes were old.</font>

628
00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:19,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Then?</font>

629
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:24,567
<font color=#FFFF00>A lot of students were hurt.</font>

630
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:26,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Since no one died from it,</font>

631
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:29,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja tried to settle,</font>

632
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,027
<font color=#FFFF00>but your uncle...</font>

633
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,137
<font color=#FFFF00>What did my uncle do?</font>

634
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,827
<font color=#FFFF00>He wanted to get to the bottom of the accident by all means...</font>

635
00:40:35,927 --> 00:40:38,967
<font color=#FFFF00>and insisted that the driver be punished.</font>

636
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:41,797
<font color=#FFFF00>So then?</font>

637
00:40:42,897 --> 00:40:43,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun.</font>

638
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:47,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja, Mi Ja,</font>

639
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,567
<font color=#FFFF00>other parents, and I were going to...</font>

640
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,897
<font color=#FFFF00>settle the accident.</font>

641
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:56,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja even came up with the settlement.</font>

642
00:40:57,137 --> 00:40:58,767
<font color=#FFFF00>However, your uncle...</font>

643
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:03,497
<font color=#FFFF00>He was literarily jumping up and down out of anger.</font>

644
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,637
<font color=#FFFF00>We weren't able to stop him.</font>

645
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,137
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja said...</font>

646
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:10,767
<font color=#FFFF00>if she become criminally liable for the accident,</font>

647
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:13,267
<font color=#FFFF00>her academy would be in ruins.</font>

648
00:41:14,197 --> 00:41:15,327
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

649
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:21,227
<font color=#FFFF00>she framed the driver and blamed it on his drunk driving.</font>

650
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I helped her to frame him.</font>

651
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:28,797
<font color=#FFFF00>He was known...</font>

652
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:31,697
<font color=#FFFF00>to be an alcoholic in the neighborhood.</font>

653
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:35,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Yoon. How could you do such a thing?</font>

654
00:41:36,067 --> 00:41:38,367
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you frame an innocent man?</font>

655
00:41:38,397 --> 00:41:40,167
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't want to.</font>

656
00:41:40,867 --> 00:41:43,567
<font color=#FFFF00>It was your uncle who hinted that...</font>

657
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,197
<font color=#FFFF00>he might have driven drunk.</font>

658
00:41:46,227 --> 00:41:49,327
<font color=#FFFF00>He wanted him to take a sobriety test since he was an alcoholic.</font>

659
00:41:49,897 --> 00:41:53,027
<font color=#FFFF00>He even said he'd sue Guem Ja for hiring such an unfit driver.</font>

660
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,767
<font color=#FFFF00>How was she supposed to handle your uncle when he went berserk.</font>

661
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:01,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead of both of them going down for the accident,</font>

662
00:42:02,097 --> 00:42:03,667
<font color=#FFFF00>she thought one person would be enough.</font>

663
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,797
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be true. Even if it was true...</font>

664
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,897
<font color=#FFFF00>It is true. Now your uncle has become soft.</font>

665
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Given his old character, this isn't out of his character.</font>

666
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:21,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Out of all people, how could a son of the driver return?</font>

667
00:42:22,997 --> 00:42:25,167
<font color=#FFFF00>He even returned to his old neighborhood.</font>

668
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:28,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt awful and terrified.</font>

669
00:42:29,227 --> 00:42:30,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather be here.</font>

670
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Does my uncle...</font>

671
00:42:36,827 --> 00:42:39,467
<font color=#FFFF00>- know about this? - No, he doesn't.</font>

672
00:42:39,897 --> 00:42:42,827
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a lifetime secret between Guem Ja and me.</font>

673
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:44,637
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Yoon.</font>

674
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:47,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do that?</font>

675
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,397
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

676
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:52,867
<font color=#FFFF00>how is your uncle's family?</font>

677
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I bet Mr. Lee won't leave your uncle's family alone.</font>

680
00:43:03,997 --> 00:43:05,637
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for yesterday.</font>

681
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:09,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. How about now?</font>

682
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,067
<font color=#FFFF00>You're already here.</font>

683
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,167

684
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:20,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I will take you to a place I have in mind.</font>

685
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:22,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Sounds great.</font>

687
00:44:12,597 --> 00:44:14,827
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, Mom. - What's up with you?</font>

688
00:44:14,897 --> 00:44:17,297
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you wanted to have dinner together. Where have you gone?</font>

689
00:44:17,297 --> 00:44:19,767
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Mom. What time is it?</font>

690
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:21,927
<font color=#FFFF00>It's 6'o clock. What's going on?</font>

691
00:44:22,567 --> 00:44:25,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I expected to have dinner together and yet, you're making me wait?</font>

692
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:28,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. This is so like you.</font>

693
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be there soon. Come out of the house.</font>

694
00:44:31,527 --> 00:44:33,727
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will pick you up with my car. - With your car?</font>

695
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:35,167
<font color=#FFFF00>You have a car?</font>

696
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:39,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Why do you have a car?</font>

697
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:43,267
<font color=#FFFF00>Ta-da! Starting today, I have a car.</font>

698
00:44:43,397 --> 00:44:46,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Is someone getting married? What is this ribbon doing here?</font>

699
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,997
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with it? It's pretty.</font>

700
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:50,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you buy this?</font>

701
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:52,967
<font color=#FFFF00>- A guy gave this to me. - Who?</font>

702
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,767
<font color=#FFFF00>This guy is new.</font>

703
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:58,097

704

<font color=#FFFF00>Please get in.</font>

705
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:15,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are we going to eat?</font>

706
00:45:16,397 --> 00:45:17,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Wear the seatbelt.</font>

707
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:19,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

708
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:22,567
<font color=#FFFF00>do we have to eat on a day like this?</font>

709
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:24,427
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

710
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:26,997
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you're taking me out.</font>

711
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to be treated by my daughter.</font>

712
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:33,197
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something much more important than food.</font>

713
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:34,497
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

714
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:35,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

715
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:43,997

716
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:46,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you bring me here?</font>

717
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:51,327
<font color=#FFFF00>This is what's more important than food.</font>

718
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:01,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, hurry up.</font>

719
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:02,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

720
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,027
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

721
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,067
<font color=#FFFF00>After the concert,</font>

722
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:16,167
<font color=#FFFF00>we can eat with Dad. All three of us together.</font>

723
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,767
<font color=#FFFF00>- Jeong Eun. - Mom.</font>

724
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I am 31 years old, and I have never eaten...</font>

725
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:23,267
<font color=#FFFF00>a meal with my parents. I'm such a pitiful person.</font>

726
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:25,267
<font color=#FFFF00>They say you never know who will die first.</font>

727
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Please cut me a slack...</font>

728
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,467
<font color=#FFFF00>in case I might die before you. Okay?</font>

729
00:46:29,867 --> 00:46:31,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let this one pass.</font>

730
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,697
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom. - Let go of me!</font>

731
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:35,227

<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

733
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:39,697
<font color=#FFFF00>you know those people, right?</font>

734
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:42,627
<font color=#FFFF00>They are the people from the music industry.</font>

735
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,727
<font color=#FFFF00>They know both you and Dad.</font>

736
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:48,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You are famous, and Dad is even more famous.</font>

737
00:46:48,567 --> 00:46:49,567
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

738
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:53,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's appear cool and fabulous.</font>

739
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:56,127
<font color=#FFFF00>You will get embarrassed if they see you like this.</font>

740
00:46:57,197 --> 00:46:59,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Act like a Hollywood couple who are cool with each other...</font>

741
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:01,027
<font color=#FFFF00>after the divorce.</font>

742
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:03,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go inside like one of them.</font>

743
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:05,927
<font color=#FFFF00>We are nothing like a Hollywood couple.</font>

744
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:07,867
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - You are the Hollywood star.</font>

745
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:10,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

746
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:14,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Mom.</font>

747
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:37,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo,</font>

748
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:39,627
<font color=#FFFF00>this is the place.</font>

749
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:41,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Mom.</font>

750
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,897
<font color=#FFFF00>He is world-famous baritone...</font>

751
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:46,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Korea ever gave birth to.</font>

752
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:53,067
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Watching his performance will...</font>

753
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:55,997
<font color=#FFFF00>make you a world-renowned opera singer.</font>

754
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:57,967
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I paid...</font>

755
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:03,527
<font color=#FFFF00>an unbelievably high price...</font>

756
00:48:05,327 --> 00:48:07,297
<font color=#FFFF00>to buy these tickets for you.</font>

757
00:48:07,497 --> 00:48:08,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you, Mom.</font>

758
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Shall we go in, Chang Soo?</font>

759
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:12,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

760
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:21,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Here are the tickets.</font>

761
00:48:25,327 --> 00:48:26,927
<font color=#FFFF00>People are going in. Hurry up.</font>

762
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:28,527
<font color=#FFFF00>It's going to start.</font>

763
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:32,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

764
00:48:33,267 --> 00:48:34,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Here are the tickets.</font>

765
00:48:34,727 --> 00:48:35,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

766
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,027
<font color=#FFFF00>You get it now, don't you?</font>

767
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:22,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, why don't you take off your sunglasses?</font>

768
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:25,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see your dad's face.</font>

769
00:49:25,227 --> 00:49:27,227
<font color=#FFFF00>We came here to hear his singing, not to see his face.</font>

770
00:49:27,897 --> 00:49:30,697
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable, Mom.</font>

771
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,067
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

772
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for coming...</font>

773
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:20,997
<font color=#FFFF00>to watch my humble concert.</font>

774
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:31,367
<font color=#FFFF00>I've dedicated my life to music,</font>

775
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:34,967
<font color=#FFFF00>and music is the only thing I know. I am a foolish man.</font>

776
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:36,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Even at this age,</font>

777
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:40,727
<font color=#FFFF00>there is nothing else I can do but sing, and...</font>

778
00:50:41,097 --> 00:50:44,997
<font color=#FFFF00>it sometimes makes me embarrassed and sometimes makes me proud.</font>

779
00:50:49,627 --> 00:50:52,497
<font color=#FFFF00>What a joke.</font>

780
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him to sing one more song.</font>

781
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:57,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

782
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:58,797
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

783
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:00,997
<font color=#FFFF00>There is just one thing...</font>

784
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I regret.</font>

785
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,497
<font color=#FFFF00>I hurt the woman...</font>

786
00:51:08,227 --> 00:51:10,497
<font color=#FFFF00>who waited for me.</font>

787
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:16,767
<font color=#FFFF00>My first love and my daughter...</font>

788
00:51:16,767 --> 00:51:18,297
<font color=#FFFF00>are here.</font>

789
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are they? Who are they? Where are they?</font>

790
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:25,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are they, Mom?</font>

791
00:51:30,197 --> 00:51:31,467
<font color=#FFFF00>They are right there.</font>

792
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:38,867
<font color=#FFFF00>They are seated over there. My love...</font>

793
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Professor Han Ae Ri...</font>

794
00:51:42,527 --> 00:51:44,167
<font color=#FFFF00>and my daughter Han Jeong Eun,</font>

795
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:48,397
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to dedicate this song to you.</font>

796
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,927
<font color=#FFFF00>What? It's Ae Ri.</font>

797
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:00,497
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Great Aunt.</font>

798
00:52:00,497 --> 00:52:02,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take a seat.</font>

799
00:52:04,797 --> 00:52:06,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

800
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:18,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Somewhere over the hill</font>

801
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:25,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Perhaps you live there</font>

802
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:35,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Before time and passing seasons</font>

803
00:52:37,297 --> 00:52:44,197
<font color=#FFFF00>We are weak</font>

804
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:53,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Somewhere here where the wind reaches</font>

805
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:57,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Are there</font>

806
00:52:57,497 --> 00:53:00,467
<font color=#FFFF00>- Any traces of us - Mom.</font>

807
00:53:02,427 --> 00:53:05,427
<font color=#FFFF00>You and I have been lonely</font>

808
00:53:06,127 --> 00:53:08,827
<font color=#FFFF00>For as long as time passed</font>

809
00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:09,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

810
00:53:13,467 --> 00:53:14,597
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

811
00:53:14,597 --> 00:53:16,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Just leave me alone.</font>

812
00:53:21,467 --> 00:53:28,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Somewhere here where sorrow reaches</font>

813
00:53:30,197 --> 00:53:35,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Are we still alive</font>

814
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

815
00:53:58,597 --> 00:53:59,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

816
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:01,727
<font color=#FFFF00>your fan.</font>

817
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:04,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

818
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:06,867
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm not feeling well today. - I know. I know.</font>

819
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:09,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. I know.</font>

820
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:10,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

821
00:54:10,927 --> 00:54:12,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I know. Have a seat.</font>

822
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:21,527
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how my aunt-in-law is.</font>

823
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,167
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not easy to deal with.</font>

824
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:25,727
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

825
00:54:25,797 --> 00:54:27,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean Professor Han Ae Ri.</font>

826
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:30,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I am her niece-in-law.</font>

827
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:33,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

828
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:38,397
<font color=#FFFF00>there's something I can help you with.</font>

829
00:54:43,797 --> 00:54:45,997
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is determined.</font>

830
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:47,967
<font color=#FFFF00>Her computer might get set on fire.</font>

831
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:51,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Her pride must've been hurt. She failed on her first try.</font>

832
00:54:51,227 --> 00:54:53,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, you can do well this time, right?</font>

833
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:55,367
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, of course. I can do well.</font>

834
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,197
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is she so confident?</font>

835
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,827
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, have you done...</font>

836
00:55:01,827 --> 00:55:03,197
<font color=#FFFF00>the survey for the yoga and Pilates line?</font>

837
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:04,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Most professionals liked them.</font>

838
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:08,167
<font color=#FFFF00>They like the design and the excellent elasticity.</font>

839
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:10,167
<font color=#FFFF00>The report is on your desk.</font>

840
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,727
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it received among the age groups?</font>

841
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:15,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Our target age groups, the 20s and 30s are most receptive.</font>

842
00:55:15,397 --> 00:55:16,927
<font color=#FFFF00>The moving studio will open...</font>

843
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:20,227
<font color=#FFFF00>in Konkuk University Station where there will be a younger clientele.</font>

844
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:23,697
<font color=#FFFF00>The report regarding this matter is on your desk as well.</font>

845
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:26,867
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you, Dong Hui? Are you sick?</font>

846
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:30,027
<font color=#FFFF00>She's not sick. She's angry that she lost to Writer Choi.</font>

847
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:32,567
<font color=#FFFF00>She is sick with anger.</font>

848
00:55:33,227 --> 00:55:35,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I really hope you win this time, Dong Hui.</font>

849
00:55:36,127 --> 00:55:40,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you survey reactions towards the competing company's new products?</font>

850
00:55:40,697 --> 00:55:42,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I did. I did everything.</font>

851
00:55:42,897 --> 00:55:44,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Please just look at your desk.</font>

852
00:55:45,997 --> 00:55:49,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see the way she looked at me? I can't believe this.</font>

853
00:55:51,027 --> 00:55:52,767
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. Director. - Hi. Director.</font>

854
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:57,967
<font color=#FFFF00>- What are you doing, Ms. Oh? - Pardon?</font>

855
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,667
<font color=#FFFF00>She's writing next episode's script.</font>

856
00:56:01,327 --> 00:56:04,867
<font color=#FFFF00>She finished all her given assignments. I just checked.</font>

857
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,167
<font color=#FFFF00>You are writing next episode's script?</font>

858
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:09,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am.</font>

859
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:12,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't Director Han inform you?</font>

860
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:14,567
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

861
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:17,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director.</font>

862
00:56:18,097 --> 00:56:19,897
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang. Can we have a word?</font>

863
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:36,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you get the message yet?</font>

864
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:40,627
<font color=#FFFF00>- What message? - She'll no longer write scripts.</font>

865
00:56:42,997 --> 00:56:44,197
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you find out?</font>

866
00:56:44,397 --> 00:56:46,597
<font color=#FFFF00>How? I heard it from President Lee.</font>

867
00:56:48,327 --> 00:56:51,997
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to try to persuade President Lee. Don't tell her yet.</font>

868
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:55,227
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Han Seong Joon. Are you serious?</font>

869
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:58,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you dragging this out? How much help can she be?</font>

870
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:01,797
<font color=#FFFF00>When she finishes the scripts, we'll end up using Writer Choi's scripts.</font>

871
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:04,867
<font color=#FFFF00>If we continue with this, we are sacrificing our resources...</font>

872
00:57:04,867 --> 00:57:06,967
<font color=#FFFF00>to help her gain experience and earn money.</font>

873
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,197
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee agreed on this. That's why he called you in.</font>

874
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are they fighting so much?</font>

875
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:17,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it about the scripts again?</font>

876
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:23,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you talk to President Lee about this?</font>

877
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:27,067
<font color=#FFFF00>No, he called me first and told me this himself.</font>

878
00:57:28,827 --> 00:57:31,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't look at me like that. I don't play games.</font>

879
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:33,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Then it's fine.</font>

880
00:57:34,497 --> 00:57:35,997
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

881
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:40,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever it takes, I will convince President Lee.</font>

882
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:41,827
<font color=#FFFF00>You should do whatever you want to do.</font>

883
00:57:42,097 --> 00:57:44,227
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean that I should do whatever I want to do?</font>

884
00:57:45,467 --> 00:57:47,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pick at my words. I am tired.</font>

885
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:48,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

886
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:51,627
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you please leave? I'm exhausted.</font>

887
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:55,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Go home and focus on your writing.</font>

888
00:57:56,827 --> 00:57:58,067
<font color=#FFFF00>She's right.</font>

889
00:57:58,497 --> 00:58:01,567
<font color=#FFFF00>You got too many assignments from the Marketing Department.</font>

890
00:58:01,567 --> 00:58:03,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

891
00:58:03,297 --> 00:58:06,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I also hope that she would succeed as a writer.</font>

892
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:09,067
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how she will keep giving me soybean paste and red chili paste.</font>

893
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:12,867
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about that. I will continue to provide with those.</font>

894
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, how can you be so easily bribed?</font>

895
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:19,127
<font color=#FFFF00>My point is you should write as if today is your last day alive.</font>

896
00:58:19,227 --> 00:58:20,227
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

897
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:28,367
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello, President. - Hello, President.</font>

898
00:58:28,367 --> 00:58:30,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi. Are you going home now?</font>

899
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,327
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir.</font>

900
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,667
<font color=#FFFF00>Look who's here. Aren't you Dong Hui?</font>

901
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:40,327
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, President. - All right.</font>

902
00:58:41,067 --> 00:58:43,767
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you going home too? - Yes, I am.</font>

903
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:45,297
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

904
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I am home.</font>

905
00:58:48,497 --> 00:58:49,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Gwang Jin is here.</font>

906
00:58:51,097 --> 00:58:54,527
<font color=#FFFF00>Although it was so sudden, I did try to prepare something for the guest.</font>

907
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:56,597
<font color=#FFFF00>I wonder if this will be to the guest's liking or not.</font>

908
00:59:02,027 --> 00:59:03,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

909
00:59:04,427 --> 00:59:05,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

910
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:41,497
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it?</font>

911
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:44,767
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Han Seong Joon across the street.</font>

912
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:49,467
<font color=#FFFF00>You're visiting me often now.</font>

913
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:55,027
<font color=#FFFF00>- Would you like a drink? - Yes.</font>

914
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:57,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Come in.</font>

915
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you take out the ice?</font>

916
01:00:07,697 --> 01:00:08,697
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

917
01:00:22,527 --> 01:00:23,567
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

918
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:26,467
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels more friendly to see you in my kitchen.</font>

919
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:30,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

920
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,867
<font color=#FFFF00>If you were my brother, we could have...</font>

921
01:00:36,627 --> 01:00:39,867
<font color=#FFFF00>eaten ramyeon together, Couldn't we have?</font>

922
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:44,827
<font color=#FFFF00>I am just joking.</font>

923
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:49,667
<font color=#FFFF00>If we become too friendly, it will interfere with our business.</font>

924
01:00:50,197 --> 01:00:51,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go to the living room.</font>

925
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:04,967
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. So what do you want to talk about?</font>

926
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:07,067
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't let go of Writer Oh Dong Hui.</font>

927
01:01:08,967 --> 01:01:11,527
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so like you.</font>

928
01:01:11,867 --> 01:01:13,727
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not running a business.</font>

929
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:17,697
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not making a product but a work of art and cultural art.</font>

930
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,127
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why the crew members including writers aren't...</font>

931
01:01:22,127 --> 01:01:25,567
<font color=#FFFF00>pieces of tools. We are colleagues producing a work of art together.</font>

932
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,597
<font color=#FFFF00>They're not pieces that I can change because they are not adequate.</font>

933
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:35,397
<font color=#FFFF00>You are the worst as a businessman.</font>

934
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:39,327
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether it was kindness or hostility towards me that made you invest,</font>

935
01:01:39,527 --> 01:01:41,227
<font color=#FFFF00>if you invested because you believed in my ability,</font>

936
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:43,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you can continue to trust my decisions.</font>

937
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:47,467
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you would give Writer Oh at least a chance to redeem herself.</font>

938
01:01:50,197 --> 01:01:52,097
<font color=#FFFF00>What is the reason I have to trust your decisions?</font>

939
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,167
<font color=#FFFF00>I say this with respect.</font>

940
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:56,627
<font color=#FFFF00>I would like to appeal to your emotion.</font>

941
01:01:57,097 --> 01:02:00,467
<font color=#FFFF00>Please consider me as your brother and give me another chance.</font>

942
01:02:03,167 --> 01:02:06,767
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think what you just said is rude?</font>

943
01:02:08,297 --> 01:02:11,927
<font color=#FFFF00>I certainly told you that my brother is dead.</font>

944
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:15,667
<font color=#FFFF00>I am too desperate that I am willing to be rude.</font>

945
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:22,297
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like her that much?</font>

946
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:27,097
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asking me about my personal feelings?</font>

947
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:32,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I ask? Just like an older brother asking his younger brother.</font>

948
01:02:34,997 --> 01:02:37,867
<font color=#FFFF00>I love her very much.</font>

949
01:02:39,527 --> 01:02:43,367
<font color=#FFFF00>How about you? Have you ever loved anyone?</font>

950
01:02:44,467 --> 01:02:47,197
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not certain. I've never...</font>

951
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I might have loved once or twice.</font>

952
01:02:53,897 --> 01:02:57,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't have time, for I've looked for my brother my whole life.</font>

953
01:02:58,927 --> 01:03:02,327
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never rested, loved anyone,</font>

954
01:03:02,867 --> 01:03:04,427
<font color=#FFFF00>or gone on trips.</font>

955
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,367
<font color=#FFFF00>I only worked...</font>

956
01:03:07,627 --> 01:03:09,197
<font color=#FFFF00>to find my brother.</font>

957
01:03:12,027 --> 01:03:14,797
<font color=#FFFF00>In a way, I've only loved him...</font>

958
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:16,927
<font color=#FFFF00>and looked for him my entire life.</font>

959
01:03:18,927 --> 01:03:19,927
<font color=#FFFF00>Although the result...</font>

960
01:03:22,927 --> 01:03:24,867
<font color=#FFFF00>is too miserable.</font>

961
01:03:35,027 --> 01:03:36,027
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

962
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:38,797
<font color=#FFFF00>You should leave.</font>

963
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,897
<font color=#FFFF00>I am cold-hearted by nature.</font>

964
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:45,027
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't intend to get involved in someone's love life.</font>

965
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:47,797
<font color=#FFFF00>So you should leave now.</font>

966
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:51,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

967
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:00,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

968
01:04:10,997 --> 01:04:13,627
<font color=#FFFF00>If I may, may I ask who this is?</font>

969
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:16,397
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you ask?</font>

970
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:20,727
<font color=#FFFF00>Just because.</font>

971
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:26,097
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm seeing a lot of new sides of you tonight.</font>

972
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,427
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my brother when he was young.</font>

973
01:04:34,797 --> 01:04:35,797
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it answer your question?</font>

974
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:38,727
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

975
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:01,567
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

976
01:05:01,867 --> 01:05:04,297
<font color=#FFFF00>How serious are you and Seong Joon?</font>

977
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:06,527
<font color=#FFFF00>How involved are you with him?</font>

978
01:05:09,127 --> 01:05:10,127
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you okay?</font>

979
01:05:11,778 --> 01:05:13,448
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a naughty man.</font>

980
01:05:13,897 --> 01:05:15,697
<font color=#FFFF00>Last night, he told me...</font>

981
01:05:16,097 --> 01:05:18,627
<font color=#FFFF00>that his brother is dead.</font>

982
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:20,167
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you hear me?</font>

983
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,427
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop drove your father...</font>

984
01:05:22,527 --> 01:05:23,967
<font color=#FFFF00>to death.</font>

985
01:05:24,467 --> 01:05:26,797
<font color=#FFFF00>One more thing. It's about Seong Joon.</font>
