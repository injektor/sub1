1
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:09,834
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

2
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:13,034
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

3
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,874
<font color="yellow">Where are you going at this late hour?</font>

4
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:19,474
<font color="yellow">I'm on my way to buy digestive medicines for my mom.</font>

5
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:25,634
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

6
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:36,604
<font color="yellow">Tell me if you are struggling to find a job.</font>

7
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,734
<font color="yellow">You know BNC Production, right?</font>

8
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:42,634
<font color="yellow">Someone I'm close to works for that company.</font>

9
00:00:43,804 --> 00:00:45,004
<font color="yellow">How did you know I'm looking for a job?</font>

10
00:00:48,404 --> 00:00:51,674
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun told me that you quit your job.</font>

11
00:00:52,304 --> 00:00:53,774
<font color="yellow">Does she know that?</font>

12
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,934
<font color="yellow">I've never told anyone in my family about it.</font>

13
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,834
<font color="yellow">Did I cross the line?</font>

14
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,104
<font color="yellow">You did...</font>

15
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:09,004
<font color="yellow">a lot.</font>

16
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:14,144
<font color="yellow">Have I done anything wrong to you?</font>

17
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,144
<font color="yellow">I think you've raised your guard too high against me.</font>

18
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:22,734
<font color="yellow">What happened the other day is...</font>

19
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:25,134
<font color="yellow">Forget it. You don't need to explain.</font>

20
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,174
<font color="yellow">I don't think...</font>

21
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,334
<font color="yellow">you are really a good person.</font>

22
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:40,234
<font color="yellow">There's no good will or kindness for no reason.</font>

23
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,374
<font color="yellow">That's what you think, right?</font>

24
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,834
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

25
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,374
<font color="yellow">However, aside from that,</font>

26
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,374
<font color="yellow">you've never made yourself clear.</font>

27
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,774
<font color="yellow">I don't know who you really are.</font>

28
00:01:58,074 --> 00:02:00,304
<font color="yellow">Then, see you.</font>

29
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:14,674
<font color="yellow">Did you find any clue?</font>

30
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:17,634
<font color="yellow">No, there's no progress yet.</font>

31
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,934
<font color="yellow">Why is there no record about Seong Joon?</font>

32
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,134
<font color="yellow">I've tracked down the hospital records with his birthday,</font>

33
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:29,704
<font color="yellow">but strangely, I couldn't find his birth mother.</font>

34
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:33,274
<font color="yellow">I think his real birthday...</font>

35
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:36,574
<font color="yellow">and the officially registered birthday are different.</font>

36
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:40,904
<font color="yellow">I suppose it's meaningless to find records with the birthday.</font>

37
00:02:42,474 --> 00:02:43,634
<font color="yellow">What about Han Hyung Seop?</font>

38
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:44,904
<font color="yellow">It's no different.</font>

39
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,104
<font color="yellow">As far as I know,</font>

40
00:02:47,104 --> 00:02:49,734
<font color="yellow">there's nobody he had an affair with.</font>

41
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,404
<font color="yellow">Let's shift the focus from his birth mother...</font>

42
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:57,934
<font color="yellow">to Seong Joon.</font>

43
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:00,034
<font color="yellow">Find every single person...</font>

44
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:02,204
<font color="yellow">who's had connections with him and his father since he was brought in.</font>

45
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,874
<font color="yellow">I need you to investigate them.</font>

46
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,104
<font color="yellow">Where's Mom?</font>

47
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:12,674
<font color="yellow">I think she's having lunch with Ms. Oh.</font>

48
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:17,004
<font color="yellow">They really have a good chemistry, don't they?</font>

49
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,874
<font color="yellow">There's one thing good about Ms. Oh's move in.</font>

50
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,734
<font color="yellow">Mother doesn't bother me anymore.</font>

51
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:29,404
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You're too mean.</font>

52
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,234
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest.</font>

53
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:33,404
<font color="yellow">People find it weird if they know about us.</font>

54
00:03:33,474 --> 00:03:35,804
<font color="yellow">I take care of Mother and Ms. Oh.</font>

55
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:38,174
<font color="yellow">They say it's even worse than the worst.</font>

56
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:40,374
<font color="yellow">What? What did you say?</font>

57
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,574
<font color="yellow">It's good since Mother isn't lonely any longer.</font>

58
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:51,034
<font color="yellow">We can pay less attention to her, so it's good for everyone after all.</font>

59
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:52,874
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

60
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:54,534
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

61
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:56,134
<font color="yellow">is your vacation over?</font>

62
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:00,574
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Stop it.</font>

63
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,604
<font color="yellow">Can't you see he's eating?</font>

64
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:06,274
<font color="yellow">What did I say? All I asked is if the vacation is over.</font>

65
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:09,074
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's over.</font>

66
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,344
<font color="yellow">Your company is very weird.</font>

67
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:14,234
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

68
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,534
<font color="yellow">are you really not going to marry...</font>

69
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,534
<font color="yellow">the lady you brought before? Are you sure?</font>

70
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:22,504
<font color="yellow">He said he won't marry her.</font>

71
00:04:22,574 --> 00:04:24,574
<font color="yellow">You've asked it so many times already.</font>

72
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:26,634
<font color="yellow">It's because she's too good.</font>

73
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:27,974
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

74
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,474
<font color="yellow">His brothers...</font>

75
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:33,174
<font color="yellow">married women from ordinary families.</font>

76
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:35,674
<font color="yellow">It'd be great if he marries a woman from a wealthy family.</font>

77
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:36,974
<font color="yellow">Mom, that is...</font>

78
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:40,904
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, change your mind and get back with her again.</font>

79
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:44,274
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she didn't visit us...</font>

80
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:47,304
<font color="yellow">for no reason.</font>

81
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:51,504
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - Please stay out of this.</font>

82
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:57,134
<font color="yellow">Guys also...</font>

83
00:04:58,204 --> 00:05:01,274
<font color="yellow">need other's help in their lives.</font>

84
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,774
<font color="yellow">Look at your brothers.</font>

85
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,734
<font color="yellow">They ended up back in their parents' house.</font>

86
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:08,374
<font color="yellow">If they had rich wives,</font>

87
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,474
<font color="yellow">they wouldn't be living in the same house,</font>

88
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:12,734
<font color="yellow">fighting every day.</font>

89
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:15,004
<font color="yellow">They're living like that...</font>

90
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,734
<font color="yellow">because they had no luck in choosing their wives at all.</font>

91
00:05:19,004 --> 00:05:20,274
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon,</font>

92
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,234
<font color="yellow">please do not...</font>

93
00:05:22,474 --> 00:05:24,974
<font color="yellow">make the same mistake your brothers made.</font>

94
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:29,434
<font color="yellow">Please consider getting back with that lady again, okay?</font>

95
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:32,274
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon,</font>

96
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:34,904
<font color="yellow">life is short,</font>

97
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:37,174
<font color="yellow">and love doesn't last forever.</font>

98
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,034
<font color="yellow">You need someone who can give you a helping hand in dire times.</font>

99
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,304
<font color="yellow">If your parents are poor, you need wealthy parents-in-law at least.</font>

100
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:46,104
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

101
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:49,174
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why are you yelling at me at this early hour?</font>

102
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:52,734
<font color="yellow">You keep talking total nonsense.</font>

103
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:54,804
<font color="yellow">You never know what will happen...</font>

104
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:57,734
<font color="yellow">to him later. I'm just telling him to marry a rich girl...</font>

105
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:59,674
<font color="yellow">unlike his brothers.</font>

106
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:01,374
<font color="yellow">Is it that wrong?</font>

107
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:04,534
<font color="yellow">I bet Hye Joo and Hee Sook will be happy to hear that.</font>

108
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,704
<font color="yellow">I'm sure they will.</font>

109
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,334
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

110
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:16,904
<font color="yellow">Are you on your way to work?</font>

111
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,104
<font color="yellow">You're also going to work, right?</font>

112
00:06:20,804 --> 00:06:21,834
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

113
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:24,274
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi's brother is going to work.</font>

114
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,974
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a chance to talk to you.</font>

115
00:06:27,134 --> 00:06:29,534
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on coming back to work.</font>

116
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:30,804
<font color="yellow">I thank you, too.</font>

117
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:35,904
<font color="yellow">I won't forget about the time you teased me being Moong Chi's brother.</font>

118
00:06:36,634 --> 00:06:37,634
<font color="yellow">We'll see.</font>

119
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,634
<font color="yellow">I heard your grandma moved downstairs.</font>

120
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:44,004
<font color="yellow">She did so that I can write.</font>

121
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:48,804
<font color="yellow">Then you must have a workroom. I would like to see it.</font>

122
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,604
<font color="yellow">You can see it later at night.</font>

123
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:54,034
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you heading to work?</font>

124
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,374
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mrs. Han.</font>

125
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:58,734
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dong Hui.</font>

126
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:00,904
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see Moong Chi.</font>

127
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,104
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

128
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:06,504
<font color="yellow">I'm here to get some fermented soybean paste.</font>

129
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,034
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother comes downstairs to have lunch.</font>

130
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:11,534
<font color="yellow">She wants to eat soybean paste soup with dried radish leaves.</font>

131
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:16,174
<font color="yellow">Where's Ms. Oh's soybean paste? She told me I could take some before.</font>

132
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,504
<font color="yellow">It's in the right barrel.</font>

133
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:21,634
<font color="yellow">This is it.</font>

134
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:24,604
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

135
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:30,974
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work, Seong Joon?</font>

136
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,034
<font color="yellow">You should go as well, Dong Hui.</font>

137
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,134
<font color="yellow">- I will. - I will.</font>

138
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,304
<font color="yellow">No one lives like me.</font>

139
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:50,874
<font color="yellow">Who takes care of two mothers and cook three meals at this age?</font>

140
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:53,374
<font color="yellow">I take care of all the family members.</font>

141
00:07:58,574 --> 00:07:59,574
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

142
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,134
<font color="yellow">That's not true.</font>

143
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,134
<font color="yellow">Why would you say such a thing?</font>

144
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:10,174
<font color="yellow">What do you mean the kids are switched? That's not true.</font>

145
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:12,104
<font color="yellow">Ah In. Let's go.</font>

146
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,834
<font color="yellow">Who is this? I don't know this number.</font>

147
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,204
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

148
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:26,774
<font color="yellow">Is this Ji Hoon's mother?</font>

149
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:29,104
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon's mother?</font>

150
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,944
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am Ji Hoon's mother.</font>

151
00:08:33,204 --> 00:08:36,304
<font color="yellow">I am Kyung Jun's mother. He was an old friend of Ji Hoon.</font>

152
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:37,604
<font color="yellow">They've been friends since first grade.</font>

153
00:08:39,574 --> 00:08:41,874
<font color="yellow">Is that right? Nice to meet you.</font>

154
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,834
<font color="yellow">Why did you call me this morning?</font>

155
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:48,174
<font color="yellow">I wanted to know which English workbook Ji Hoon's using.</font>

156
00:08:50,474 --> 00:08:52,374
<font color="yellow">English workbook?</font>

157
00:09:00,534 --> 00:09:01,604
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

158
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:05,274
<font color="yellow">how did you know that I am Ji Hoon's mother?</font>

159
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:08,774
<font color="yellow">Who told you such a thing? What do you mean they are switched?</font>

160
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:10,604
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon said so.</font>

161
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:13,404
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

162
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,774
<font color="yellow">Min Soo met Ji Hoon at Han River.</font>

163
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:20,274
<font color="yellow">He told me Ji Hoon was with your brother-in-law's family.</font>

164
00:09:20,904 --> 00:09:23,504
<font color="yellow">Min Soo called and asked him,</font>

165
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:27,104
<font color="yellow">and Ji Hoon said his mother was switched.</font>

166
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:35,834
<font color="yellow">That brings me to my next question.</font>

167
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:38,604
<font color="yellow">Since you are not Ji Hoon's mother,</font>

168
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,634
<font color="yellow">can you tell us which academies Ji Hoon is attending?</font>

169
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:51,834
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

170
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:55,074
<font color="yellow">I don't know which workbook he's using.</font>

171
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,834
<font color="yellow">We haven't even met once.</font>

172
00:09:58,834 --> 00:10:01,834
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's over the line? Calling me in the morning like this?</font>

173
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,604
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

174
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:09,174
<font color="yellow">I am not interested in my children's education,</font>

175
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:13,444
<font color="yellow">but I got a top student at his school for free.</font>

176
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:16,034
<font color="yellow">I am so excited and happy.</font>

177
00:10:16,134 --> 00:10:17,804
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

178
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:22,304
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Call me again. I'll finish you.</font>

179
00:10:24,574 --> 00:10:27,674
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am ignorant and Ji Hoon's mother. What do you want?</font>

180
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:33,304
<font color="yellow">Han Ji Hoon. You, brat.</font>

181
00:10:33,304 --> 00:10:35,034
<font color="yellow">How can you tell what happened?</font>

182
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,834
<font color="yellow">Is that something you're proud of? Is it?</font>

183
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:41,204
<font color="yellow">- You little brat. - Hey. What are you doing?</font>

184
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:42,474
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

185
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,874
<font color="yellow">You told your friends that you were switched and I am not your mother.</font>

186
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:50,474
<font color="yellow">Did you tell your friends? Are you trying to spread the news?</font>

187
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:52,604
<font color="yellow">How can you do this...</font>

188
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,974
<font color="yellow">without talking to us first?</font>

189
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:56,134
<font color="yellow">Is it not true?</font>

190
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,004
<font color="yellow">Min Soo asked me what happened.</font>

191
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,634
<font color="yellow">He wondered how I ended up at Han River.</font>

192
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:03,334
<font color="yellow">It's because I never go such places.</font>

193
00:11:03,574 --> 00:11:06,074
<font color="yellow">He kept asking for an answer. So I told him.</font>

194
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,734
<font color="yellow">Everyone will find out eventually. The school will start soon.</font>

195
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,404
<font color="yellow">You won't come to school, Mother?</font>

196
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,074
<font color="yellow">No, I will. I will go to school.</font>

197
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:19,404
<font color="yellow">You will come to school, too. Right, Aunt?</font>

198
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:24,404
<font color="yellow">Did you just call me Aunt?</font>

199
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:27,004
<font color="yellow">Yes. Everyone will find out, then.</font>

200
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:29,104
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me?</font>

201
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,204
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

202
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:36,504
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

203
00:11:45,634 --> 00:11:49,174
<font color="yellow">Tell I'll be late because my child is sick.</font>

204
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:58,634
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, let me go to work.</font>

205
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:02,034
<font color="yellow">I am an office worker.</font>

206
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:05,774
<font color="yellow">I am a manager of Planning Department for a cosmetic company.</font>

207
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:07,534
<font color="yellow">You are being inconsiderate.</font>

208
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:11,474
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Do you want to go to work now?</font>

209
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,774
<font color="yellow">- What will I do if I don't? - The school will start soon.</font>

210
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:19,004
<font color="yellow">We have to resolve this problem first.</font>

211
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,374
<font color="yellow">How can we resolve it again?</font>

212
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,634
<font color="yellow">What do you want to do?</font>

213
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:27,634
<font color="yellow">How are you going to tell Ji Hoon and Chang Soo are switched?</font>

214
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,174
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I will tell the truth.</font>

215
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,404
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

216
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:34,174
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

217
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:36,934
<font color="yellow">Don't you think about the children?</font>

218
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:41,674
<font color="yellow">They will be teased when other students find out about it.</font>

219
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:42,704
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

220
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,734
<font color="yellow">- Then what? - We have to pretend it's not true.</font>

221
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,834
<font color="yellow">At home, our hands are tied...</font>

222
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,934
<font color="yellow">and everyone is living at their own home,</font>

223
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:54,304
<font color="yellow">but it will be chaotic if this news gets out to school.</font>

224
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:58,204
<font color="yellow">It's his last year of middle school. He will go to high school soon.</font>

225
00:12:58,504 --> 00:12:59,574
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

226
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:03,774
<font color="yellow">Shall I be Chang Soo's mom while you're Ji Hoon's mom at school?</font>

227
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,204
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - When they come home,</font>

228
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:11,634
<font color="yellow">I am Ji Hoon's mom and you're Chang Soo's mom?</font>

229
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,774
<font color="yellow">- That's right. - Hey.</font>

230
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:18,574
<font color="yellow">You don't like my Chang Soo that much, right?</font>

231
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:20,734
<font color="yellow">Who said I don't like him?</font>

232
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:24,274
<font color="yellow">First of all, they will be teased.</font>

233
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,574
<font color="yellow">It'll be hard for you to be Ji Hoon's mom...</font>

234
00:13:26,574 --> 00:13:28,374
<font color="yellow">and for me to be Chang Soo's.</font>

235
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,704
<font color="yellow">It will be chaotic at school, too.</font>

236
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:35,534
<font color="yellow">So for now, I will be Ji Hoon's mom...</font>

237
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:37,534
<font color="yellow">and you will be Chang Soo's mom.</font>

238
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:40,104
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - You startled me.</font>

239
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:41,904
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

240
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:44,974
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I can see what's in your mind?</font>

241
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:49,074
<font color="yellow">You are embarrassed of Chang Soo.</font>

242
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,674
<font color="yellow">You were showing off as a mother of a top student.</font>

243
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:58,974
<font color="yellow">Now you are a mother of a student who gets the lowest score.</font>

244
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:03,134
<font color="yellow">That's why you are embarrassed and humiliated. Isn't that right?</font>

245
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,274
<font color="yellow">I can't say I am not embarrassed.</font>

246
00:14:06,774 --> 00:14:07,804
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

247
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,074
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes.</font>

248
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:22,574
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you feel the same?</font>

249
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,274
<font color="yellow">Children are a mirror of their parents.</font>

250
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,504
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

251
00:14:31,034 --> 00:14:33,704
<font color="yellow">I am not going to work today. I am not going.</font>

252
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,534
<font color="yellow">I am going to teach you a lesson today.</font>

253
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:39,834
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

254
00:14:40,734 --> 00:14:44,534
<font color="yellow">Will you only keep a good son?</font>

255
00:14:46,574 --> 00:14:48,734
<font color="yellow">Will you raise him when he's good...</font>

256
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:53,434
<font color="yellow">and throw him out when he's not good? What kind of a parent are you?</font>

257
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,074
<font color="yellow">You are jumping to conclusions.</font>

258
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:57,904
<font color="yellow">If this is how you are going to handle things,</font>

259
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:02,504
<font color="yellow">give me back Chang Soo. I will raise both of them.</font>

260
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:06,334
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you brought this up.</font>

261
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,304
<font color="yellow">Send Ji Hoon back to me.</font>

262
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:11,634
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon will go to high school soon. If you raise him,</font>

263
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,074
<font color="yellow">he won't be able to get into a specialized high school.</font>

264
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:20,904
<font color="yellow">My goodness. You're still out of your mind.</font>

265
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:25,104
<font color="yellow">You are busy anyway.</font>

266
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:28,204
<font color="yellow">I will raise both Ji Hoon and Chang Soo.</font>

267
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:31,174
<font color="yellow">Send Ji Hoon back to me. Let me be his mother...</font>

268
00:15:31,204 --> 00:15:34,134
<font color="yellow">until he graduates middle school...</font>

269
00:15:34,374 --> 00:15:36,074
<font color="yellow">and starts high school.</font>

270
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:37,604
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

271
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:40,774
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

272
00:15:47,174 --> 00:15:50,504
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do with her? What should I do?</font>

273
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:53,604
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee Sook!</font>

274
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:56,574
<font color="yellow">When are you going to come to your senses?</font>

275
00:15:57,074 --> 00:16:00,334
<font color="yellow">I want to throw you out. I do.</font>

276
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:03,274
<font color="yellow">I seriously want to kick you out. You, witch.</font>

277
00:16:06,204 --> 00:16:08,834
<font color="yellow">Take out what's inside. Take out everything.</font>

278
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:09,904
<font color="yellow">- We will. - We will.</font>

281
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,104
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, this can cause a big accident.</font>

282
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,504
<font color="yellow">- You really have to get it fixed. - You should bring your car, then.</font>

283
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:39,034
<font color="yellow">All the other drivers bring their own cars.</font>

284
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,634
<font color="yellow">But you're using my car...</font>

285
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,504
<font color="yellow">and you have so many complaints.</font>

286
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,804
<font color="yellow">If you want to fix it so badly, you should pay for it.</font>

287

290
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,404
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

291

293
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,644
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

294
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:16,434
<font color="yellow">- Smell this. - Goodness.</font>

295
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,644
<font color="yellow">- You are gross. - How does it taste?</font>

296
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,734
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

297
00:17:22,904 --> 00:17:23,934
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with this?</font>

298
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,004
<font color="yellow">Move!</font>

00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:37,374
<font color="yellow">It's coming down.</font>

301
00:17:41,534 --> 00:17:42,704
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

302
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,734
<font color="yellow">Guem Ja's building is getting torn down today.</font>

303

<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

304
00:17:51,144 --> 00:17:54,704
<font color="yellow">Why did Guem Ja do that to get arrested by police?</font>

305

<font color="yellow">She's too old to go to prison.</font>

307
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:06,204
<font color="yellow">Who doesn't break the law like her?</font>

308
00:18:06,304 --> 00:18:09,574
<font color="yellow">The problem is who reported her to the police.</font>

309
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:11,604
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

310
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:14,904
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of problems in this town.</font>

311
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:16,474
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

312
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:20,644
<font color="yellow">Mi Ja has been running a grocery store for many years,</font>

313
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:22,434
<font color="yellow">and she recently bankrupted and got kicked out.</font>

314
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:25,874
<font color="yellow">Guem Ja and her husband are about to go to jail together.</font>

315
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:29,204
<font color="yellow">Besides, their children got laid off and became unemployed.</font>

316
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:31,404
<font color="yellow">Mi Ja's son even got private loans.</font>

317
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:32,834
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

318
00:18:33,304 --> 00:18:34,504
<font color="yellow">So even their children are suffering.</font>

319
00:18:34,674 --> 00:18:35,704
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

320
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:38,104
<font color="yellow">it's because of that incident.</font>

321
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,774
<font color="yellow">In the past, Guem Ja's driver...</font>

322
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,734
<font color="yellow">drunk-drove and got into a car accident at the intersection.</font>

323
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,274
<font color="yellow">I told you not to talk about that time.</font>

324
00:18:49,604 --> 00:18:51,534
<font color="yellow">My children almost died that time.</font>

325
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:54,734
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep bringing that up?</font>

326
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,334
<font color="yellow">I don't want to talk about it either, but look.</font>

327
00:18:57,434 --> 00:19:00,804
<font color="yellow">Both Guem Ja and Mi Ja got totally ruined.</font>

328
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:04,174
<font color="yellow">What does that have to do with that incident?</font>

329
00:19:04,804 --> 00:19:05,934
<font color="yellow">Both of them...</font>

330
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,674
<font color="yellow">are the witnesses of that incident.</font>

331
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:13,534
<font color="yellow">Are you saying it's the curse of the dead driver?</font>

332
00:19:13,934 --> 00:19:16,334
<font color="yellow">I heard he had a son.</font>

333
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:20,104
<font color="yellow">Perhaps his son came back to take his revenge.</font>

334
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:22,204
<font color="yellow">What a nonsense.</font>

335
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:25,144
<font color="yellow">That's a complete nonsense. His father was the one...</font>

336
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,644
<font color="yellow">who almost killed many kids by drunk-driving.</font>

337
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:31,034
<font color="yellow">How can he dare to show up here?</font>

338
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:35,434
<font color="yellow">He might think his father wasn't drunk-driving.</font>

339
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,034
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

340
00:19:38,034 --> 00:19:40,004
<font color="yellow">There were clear proofs.</font>

341
00:19:40,644 --> 00:19:42,644
<font color="yellow">Mi Ja sold him liquor,</font>

342
00:19:42,904 --> 00:19:46,534
<font color="yellow">and Guem Ja smelled alcohol from him several times that day...</font>

343
00:19:46,534 --> 00:19:48,774
<font color="yellow">and stopped him from driving.</font>

344
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:51,534
<font color="yellow">And you tested his blood.</font>

345
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:53,974
<font color="yellow">You tested his blood for blood alcohol concentration.</font>

346
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:56,704
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

347
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:59,004
<font color="yellow">You are funny.</font>

348
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,804
<font color="yellow">Still, if your husband...</font>

349
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:05,174
<font color="yellow">didn't ask for a further investigation,</font>

350
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:07,734
<font color="yellow">it wouldn't have been such a big issue.</font>

351
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,204
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

352
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:12,304
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring up my husband there?</font>

353
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:14,074
<font color="yellow">He did that. Don't you remember?</font>

354
00:20:14,104 --> 00:20:17,074
<font color="yellow">He deserves to receive a criminal penalty.</font>

355
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,974
<font color="yellow">An animal like him must be put behind the bars.</font>

356
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:22,604
<font color="yellow">You moron. How can you drive when you're drunk?</font>

357
00:20:22,604 --> 00:20:25,674
<font color="yellow">It's not true. I didn't drink. I am serious.</font>

358
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:27,834
<font color="yellow">You're still lying!</font>

359
00:20:27,834 --> 00:20:30,644
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han, stop. Will you calm down?</font>

360
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,874
<font color="yellow">My child is dying. How can I calm down?

361
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:34,144
<font color="yellow">You're just as bad.</font>

362
00:20:34,174 --> 00:20:36,804
<font color="yellow">How can you hire a drunkard like him as a driver?</font>

363
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,644
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - Saving money is good,</font>

364
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:42,074
<font color="yellow">but how can you hire an alcoholic like him as a driver?</font>

365
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,274
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get sued, too?</font>

366
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:46,774
<font color="yellow">No, I...</font>

367
00:20:47,534 --> 00:20:50,804
<font color="yellow">Drunk-driving is like a murder case. You're a murderer.</font>

368
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:53,074
<font color="yellow">Everyone else might forgive you, but I can't forgive you.</font>

369
00:20:53,074 --> 00:20:55,804
<font color="yellow">I am going to make sure to put you in jail.</font>

370
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:59,274
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Investigate him more thoroughly...</font>

371
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,174
<font color="yellow">and put him in the jail!</font>

372
00:21:01,204 --> 00:21:02,374
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

373
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:03,434
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

374
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:05,704
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

375
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:10,734
<font color="yellow">(Geumbit Academy)</font>

376
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:12,174
<font color="yellow">Let it go.</font>

377
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:14,144
<font color="yellow">Let's load it.</font>

378
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:16,704
<font color="yellow">Support it there.</font>

379
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,434
<font color="yellow">It's you.</font>

380
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:25,674
<font color="yellow">Did you get everything from the inside?</font>

381
00:21:25,674 --> 00:21:26,874
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Yes.</font>

382
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:29,834
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

383
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:33,304
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.</font>

384
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:37,104
<font color="yellow">I was thinking about something else.</font>

385
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:40,734
<font color="yellow">What were you looking at?</font>

386
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,304
<font color="yellow">The academy.</font>

387
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:49,034
<font color="yellow">Goodness, all my children went to that academy.</font>

388
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:50,574
<font color="yellow">It's too bad.</font>

389
00:21:50,604 --> 00:21:53,574
<font color="yellow">The head of the academy shouldn't have done something so foolish.</font>

390
00:21:56,704 --> 00:21:57,834
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

391
00:21:58,374 --> 00:22:01,804
<font color="yellow">Did your uncle...</font>

392
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,404
<font color="yellow">buy this building, too?</font>

393
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:07,334
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

394
00:22:08,434 --> 00:22:10,674
<font color="yellow">I heard the academy was going to close.</font>

395
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:13,434
<font color="yellow">So I came to calculate the renovation cost.</font>

396
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:16,304
<font color="yellow">You said you've been staying with your uncle...</font>

397
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,874
<font color="yellow">since your parents passed away, right?</font>

398
00:22:20,474 --> 00:22:21,534
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

399
00:22:22,204 --> 00:22:25,274
<font color="yellow">My parents passed away when I was in elementary school.</font>

400
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:28,474
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

401
00:22:29,774 --> 00:22:30,904
<font color="yellow">You were...</font>

402
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,304
<font color="yellow">way too young for that.</font>

403
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:36,204
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

404
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:39,034
<font color="yellow">That's why I've never...</font>

405
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:41,704
<font color="yellow">forgotten my dad's death.</font>

406
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:55,304
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

407
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:57,604
<font color="yellow">Be quiet and come here.</font>

408
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,104
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Hey.</font>

409
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:09,734
<font color="yellow">This is pretty. Try it on.</font>

410
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:12,974
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm not going there.</font>

411
00:23:13,004 --> 00:23:15,034
<font color="yellow">- You have to go. - Why?</font>

412
00:23:16,504 --> 00:23:19,704
<font color="yellow">Or I will go to his place and ring the bell.</font>

413
00:23:19,704 --> 00:23:22,574
<font color="yellow">Mom. Hyun Woo's not like that.</font>

414
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,474
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. If you've seen one, you've seen them all.</font>

415
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:28,704
<font color="yellow">You two got busted while secretly being on a date,</font>

416
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:30,974
<font color="yellow">and yet he made you go down and face me alone.</font>

417
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,474
<font color="yellow">I told him I'd go alone.</font>

418
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:36,074
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo wanted to come down with me and explain everything...</font>

419
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:37,574
<font color="yellow">to you. He even wanted to introduce himself.</font>

420
00:23:37,574 --> 00:23:40,634
<font color="yellow">But your daughter Han Jeong Eun stopped him.</font>

421
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,774
<font color="yellow">Are you siding with him now?</font>

422
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:46,774
<font color="yellow">Mom, I'm not siding with him.</font>

423
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:47,904
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

424
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:51,404
<font color="yellow">Even if you said that, he should have come to me and greeted me.</font>

425
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:54,304
<font color="yellow">Why would you be so royal to a coward like him?</font>

426
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,334
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

427
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:58,904
<font color="yellow">Anyway, just do as I say.</font>

428
00:23:59,174 --> 00:24:02,634
<font color="yellow">Or I will arrange for the three of us to meet.</font>

429
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:06,834
<font color="yellow">Here. Go put this on.</font>

430
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:08,904
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

431
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:13,134
<font color="yellow">- Where is the fitting room? - It's right here.</font>

432
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:18,834
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

433
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,404
<font color="yellow">She's so helpless when it comes to men.</font>

434
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,074
<font color="yellow">She has no idea how hard I try...</font>

435
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:26,204
<font color="yellow">not to make her end up like me.</font>

436
00:24:26,704 --> 00:24:28,804
<font color="yellow">She's such an immature girl.</font>

437
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:45,504
<font color="yellow">How do I look? Do I look good?</font>

438
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:50,504
<font color="yellow">I can't give you to that guy.</font>

439
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:52,274
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

440
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:55,674
<font color="yellow">My ears! Why would you shout?</font>

441
00:25:04,534 --> 00:25:05,534
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

442
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,474
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Are you at the site?</font>

443
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,204
<font color="yellow">No, I went out for a while, and now I'm resting at home.</font>

444
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:13,804
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

445
00:25:14,134 --> 00:25:15,704
<font color="yellow">If it's okay with you,</font>

446
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:18,204
<font color="yellow">can you pick me up...</font>

447
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:20,674
<font color="yellow">after 30 minutes?</font>

448
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:22,374
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

449
00:25:24,134 --> 00:25:25,204
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

450
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:30,334
<font color="yellow">Hello, Jeong Eun.</font>

451
00:25:32,734 --> 00:25:33,874
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

452
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:36,504
<font color="yellow">Just like what Prof. Han said,</font>

453
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,374
<font color="yellow">you are...</font>

454
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:40,104
<font color="yellow">beautiful.</font>

455
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,374
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

456
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,504
<font color="yellow">I heard you recently came back...</font>

457
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:45,874
<font color="yellow">from a long trip you took...</font>

458
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,804
<font color="yellow">to feel the music and the culture of the world.</font>

459
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,174
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you scared me.</font>

460
00:25:52,174 --> 00:25:56,034
<font color="yellow">Because you're a daughter of someone who enjoys arts,</font>

461
00:25:56,574 --> 00:25:59,434
<font color="yellow">your life is very unusual, too.</font>

462
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:04,204
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

463
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:07,274
<font color="yellow">do you have to laugh like that?</font>

464
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:11,334
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - Your laughter is so special.</font>

465
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,574
<font color="yellow">It's just that my voice is quite unique and special.</font>

466
00:26:19,404 --> 00:26:20,804
<font color="yellow">Shall we order first?</font>

467
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:22,934
<font color="yellow">For an appetizer,</font>

468
00:26:23,634 --> 00:26:25,034
<font color="yellow">they have great beef carpaccio...</font>

469
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,574
<font color="yellow">with fresh wild rocket...</font>

470
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:30,304
<font color="yellow">and white truffle.</font>

471
00:26:31,334 --> 00:26:34,034
<font color="yellow">I think Italian vegetable soup...</font>

472
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:37,034
<font color="yellow">with rich aroma of basil will be good.</font>

473
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:39,834
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not picky at all.</font>

474
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:41,774
<font color="yellow">No, no.</font>

475
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:46,634
<font color="yellow">Fine ladies like you must eat the finest food.</font>

476
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,404
<font color="yellow">You can't just eat anything.</font>

477
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,904
<font color="yellow">I want Italian vegetable soup...</font>

478
00:27:00,374 --> 00:27:02,004
<font color="yellow">and beef carpaccio...</font>

479
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:05,874
<font color="yellow">for this beautiful lady.</font>

480
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:09,174
<font color="yellow">I also want a bottle of wine.</font>

481
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,774
<font color="yellow">Look who's here.</font>

482
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:27,034
<font color="yellow">You should pay back the money you borrowed from me.</font>

483
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:31,004
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. Please forgive me.</font>

484
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,934
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't like traveling around the world?</font>

485
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:46,474
<font color="yellow">You borrowed money and traveled around the world.</font>

486
00:27:46,474 --> 00:27:48,674
<font color="yellow">It's about time to pay me back.</font>

487
00:27:52,934 --> 00:27:55,204
<font color="yellow">Do you think I cut you some slack...</font>

488
00:27:55,634 --> 00:27:58,634
<font color="yellow">so that you can enjoy a date with such homely guy?</font>

489
00:28:00,834 --> 00:28:03,374
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, who is he?</font>

490
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,334
<font color="yellow">- Well... - You mean me?</font>

491
00:28:09,774 --> 00:28:11,074
<font color="yellow">I'm a moneylender.</font>

492
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:14,674
<font color="yellow">Can't you see it?</font>

493
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:21,374
<font color="yellow">If you have no money to pay back,</font>

494
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,034
<font color="yellow">you should work for me.</font>

495
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:25,674
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

496
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,204
<font color="yellow">Come now!</font>

497
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:31,634
<font color="yellow">Wait...</font>

498
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,734
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'll do whatever you tell me to do.</font>

499
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:44,674
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

500
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:49,134
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

501
00:28:51,474 --> 00:28:54,834
<font color="yellow">You were so good at it. Did you learn acting before?</font>

502
00:28:57,734 --> 00:29:01,204
<font color="yellow">"If you have no money, you should work for me."</font>

503
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,334
<font color="yellow">Where did you learn such a lame line?</font>

504
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:07,204
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Jeong Eun.</font>

505
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:10,834
<font color="yellow">I have no idea what I've done.</font>

506
00:29:13,034 --> 00:29:16,574
<font color="yellow">You did exactly what I needed.</font>

507
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:20,734
<font color="yellow">Now he thinks I have a lot of debt and won't get close to me ever.</font>

508
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:26,774
<font color="yellow">You did just great as I told you.</font>

509
00:29:27,134 --> 00:29:29,574
<font color="yellow">- You're such a cute boy. - Gosh.</font>

510
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:33,634
<font color="yellow">Let's eat ramyeon.</font>

511
00:29:34,304 --> 00:29:37,334
<font color="yellow">It's a bit sad I had nothing at that fancy restaurant though.</font>

512
00:29:38,174 --> 00:29:39,404
<font color="yellow">I'll make ramyeon.</font>

513
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,904
<font color="yellow">This is how I work for you.</font>

514
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:52,074
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

515
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:54,734
<font color="yellow">who is that brat?</font>

516
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,804
<font color="yellow">He's a professor of Seojung University. He's a baritone.</font>

517
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:04,074
<font color="yellow">Your mother loves baritones, doesn't she?</font>

518
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:09,304
<font color="yellow">She'll kill me if she finds this out.</font>

519
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,804
<font color="yellow">She even bought me clothes for the blind date.</font>

520
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:15,434
<font color="yellow">You can go back to him if you want.</font>

521
00:30:15,504 --> 00:30:17,534
<font color="yellow">That's not what I mean.</font>

522
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:22,204
<font color="yellow">She doesn't like me going out with you.</font>

523
00:30:23,934 --> 00:30:24,974
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

524
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:29,704
<font color="yellow">You're not her type.</font>

525
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,574
<font color="yellow">You have fair skin.</font>

526
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,604
<font color="yellow">You're tall and have long legs and fingers.</font>

527
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:39,834
<font color="yellow">Isn't that a compliment?</font>

528
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,674
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

529
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:46,204
<font color="yellow">But my mom hates guys like you.</font>

530
00:30:48,134 --> 00:30:50,604
<font color="yellow">Then, what kind of guys does she like?</font>

531
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:53,504
<font color="yellow">Guys like that baritone.</font>

532
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:56,934
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - She likes short guys...</font>

533
00:30:56,974 --> 00:30:59,674
<font color="yellow">with a short neck, curly hair, projecting teeth, and a sweet voice.</font>

534
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:04,874
<font color="yellow">That's peculiar.</font>

535
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,674
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

536
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,204
<font color="yellow">do you have to meet the guy she likes?</font>

537
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:13,334
<font color="yellow">She's trying to live vicariously through me.</font>

538
00:31:14,204 --> 00:31:16,374
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

539
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,274
<font color="yellow">Never mind.</font>

540
00:31:19,774 --> 00:31:22,174
<font color="yellow">And she strongly believes that I should get married...</font>

541
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,634
<font color="yellow">before Seong Joon does.</font>

542
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:27,974
<font color="yellow">She hates to lag behind others.</font>

543
00:31:28,334 --> 00:31:31,034
<font color="yellow">And if Seong Joon gets married,</font>

544
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:33,504
<font color="yellow">I'll be the only one in our family who's not married.</font>

545
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,834
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon seems like a stubborn guy.</font>

546
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:44,134
<font color="yellow">Gosh, no way.</font>

547
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:46,674
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon isn't that kind of guy.</font>

548
00:31:47,034 --> 00:31:50,404
<font color="yellow">He's so nice and has a warm heart.</font>

549
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:53,404
<font color="yellow">Literally, he's a gentleman.</font>

550
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:08,974
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

551
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:13,734
<font color="yellow">Don't mind me and keep reading.</font>

552
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:24,904
<font color="yellow">I wish I had a son like you.</font>

553
00:32:26,834 --> 00:32:27,834
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

554
00:32:41,804 --> 00:32:42,934
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

555
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:52,974
<font color="yellow">Guys, don't you think you're too mean?</font>

556
00:32:53,274 --> 00:32:55,104
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui is staring at you.</font>

557
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:59,404
<font color="yellow">Why don't you just let her read Writer Jo's scenario?</font>

558
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,274
<font color="yellow">She's a temporary worker.</font>

559
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,204
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, please prepare for a meeting with...</font>

560
00:33:06,204 --> 00:33:08,534
<font color="yellow">the Planning Department. It will be about new products.</font>

561
00:33:08,874 --> 00:33:10,504
<font color="yellow">Sorry? For new products?</font>

562
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:12,674
<font color="yellow">Is spring coming already?</font>

563
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,604
<font color="yellow">Yes, spring is coming.</font>

564
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:19,134
<font color="yellow">- Don't just stand there. Move on. - Okay.</font>

565
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:23,134
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, I need a cup of tea.</font>

566
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,404
<font color="yellow">Sure, Director Bang!</font>

567
00:33:26,274 --> 00:33:28,504
<font color="yellow">What's with you? Did something happen to you?</font>

568
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,634
<font color="yellow">No, nothing happened.</font>

569
00:33:31,704 --> 00:33:33,734
<font color="yellow">I'll go make some tea for you now.</font>

570
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:40,974
<font color="yellow">Does anyone know what's the matter with Dong Hui?</font>

571
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,374
<font color="yellow">So what do you think?</font>

572
00:33:46,074 --> 00:33:49,534
<font color="yellow">Well, the producer wants the romantic relationship,</font>

573
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:51,574
<font color="yellow">so we can't just get rid of it.</font>

574
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:53,674
<font color="yellow">Director Bang,</font>

575
00:33:54,604 --> 00:33:57,274
<font color="yellow">these two don't love each other in my head.</font>

576
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,134
<font color="yellow">How on earth can they have a romantic relationship?</font>

577
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,074
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll talk to the producer about it.</font>

578
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:04,804
<font color="yellow">However, I think their love story...</font>

579
00:34:04,804 --> 00:34:07,434
<font color="yellow">will attract more viewers from different age brackets.</font>

580
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:11,934
<font color="yellow">I also believe that you're capable of adding it naturally to the plot.</font>

581
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:15,504
<font color="yellow">Regarding it, I agree with Writer Jo.</font>

582
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:19,074
<font color="yellow">I think you should talk to the producer face to face.</font>

583
00:34:19,544 --> 00:34:20,544
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

584
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:32,874
<font color="yellow">The meeting was very fruitful.</font>

585
00:34:32,874 --> 00:34:35,904
<font color="yellow">We've made a lot of progress.</font>

586
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:39,874
<font color="yellow">Director Han, we should go for some drinks with Writer Jo.</font>

587
00:34:39,904 --> 00:34:41,544
<font color="yellow">I'll go pull out the car.</font>

588
00:34:41,774 --> 00:34:45,544
<font color="yellow">I and Director Bang will visit the president and be right there.</font>

589
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:58,934
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

590
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:02,074
<font color="yellow">I'm a huge fan of yours.</font>

591
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,474
<font color="yellow">Can I have your autograph, please?</font>

592
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:08,874
<font color="yellow">Sure. What's your name again?</font>

593
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:10,734
<font color="yellow">I am Oh Dong Hui.</font>

594
00:35:12,604 --> 00:35:15,104
<font color="yellow">Are you an aspiring writer?</font>

595
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:19,974
<font color="yellow">I am. My work was selected as a runner-up in the recent contest.</font>

596
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:22,934
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

597
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:27,174
<font color="yellow">I really enjoyed watching "Sons of Pharmacist Kim".</font>

598
00:35:27,204 --> 00:35:28,904
<font color="yellow">It was a great work.</font>

599
00:35:34,864 --> 00:35:37,034
<font color="yellow">I also think...</font>

600
00:35:37,574 --> 00:35:39,544
<font color="yellow">I wrote a great masterpiece.</font>

601
00:35:47,174 --> 00:35:48,174
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

602
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:50,804
<font color="yellow">I'm struggling with the scenario I'm working on,</font>

603
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:53,774
<font color="yellow">so I'm about to lose my mind because I'm so stressed out.</font>

604
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:56,604
<font color="yellow">Many writers suffer...</font>

605
00:35:56,704 --> 00:36:00,204
<font color="yellow">from sever mood swings like me.</font>

606
00:36:01,004 --> 00:36:04,404
<font color="yellow">So you should never be a writer like me.</font>

607
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:07,734
<font color="yellow">You must be a writer who's way better than me.</font>

608
00:36:08,874 --> 00:36:11,174
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you so much.</font>

609
00:36:18,204 --> 00:36:20,974
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Ma'am. Are you going out? - Yes.</font>

610
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:27,334
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - Yes?</font>

611
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:35,544
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, ma'am?</font>

612
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:36,834
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

613
00:36:38,774 --> 00:36:42,004
<font color="yellow">Please make sure the floor is dry.</font>

614
00:36:42,204 --> 00:36:44,734
<font color="yellow">It gets frozen easily since the weather is cold.</font>

615
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:47,604
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

616
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,904
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it, ma'am. Goodbye.</font>

617
00:37:00,704 --> 00:37:01,804
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

618
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:17,474
<font color="yellow">Where are you now?</font>

619
00:37:18,074 --> 00:37:19,544
<font color="yellow">I'm about to go home.</font>

620
00:37:20,044 --> 00:37:22,104
<font color="yellow">When are you coming home? You are coming home early, right?</font>

621
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:25,474
<font color="yellow">I have a company dinner tonight. I might be late.</font>

622
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:28,504
<font color="yellow">Why do you have so many company dinners? Just come home.</font>

623
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:30,504
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

624
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:33,804
<font color="yellow">This is an important dinner.</font>

625
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:37,474
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. Let's go. Everyone's waiting.</font>

626
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:38,904
<font color="yellow">Yes, Writer Jo.</font>

627
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,434
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I will try my best to come home as early as possible.</font>

628
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:44,974
<font color="yellow">Let's get going, Writer Jo.</font>

629
00:37:46,134 --> 00:37:49,074
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. Dong Hui!</font>

630
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:09,074
<font color="yellow">Let's shake and dance!!</font>

631
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,304
<font color="yellow">I have to dance.</font>

632
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:16,904
<font color="yellow">- This is great. - Make some noise. Scream.</font>

633
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,474
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Director?</font>

634
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:29,974
<font color="yellow">Are you drunk?</font>

635
00:38:32,074 --> 00:38:33,274
<font color="yellow">Hey, Oh Dong Hui.</font>

636
00:38:34,674 --> 00:38:36,874
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're the only one who has a hard life?</font>

637
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:39,604
<font color="yellow">My life is also hard.</font>

638
00:38:40,374 --> 00:38:42,044
<font color="yellow">Don't act like a tragic heroine. That's nasty.</font>

639
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:43,434
<font color="yellow">That's nasty.</font>

640
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,004
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

641
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:05,174
<font color="yellow">- Reporter Han. - Look who's here.</font>

642
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:08,304
<font color="yellow">- Have you been well? - Yes, of course.</font>

643
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:09,704
<font color="yellow">Long time no see.</font>

644
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:10,834
<font color="yellow">What a nice place.</font>

645
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,204
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

646
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:13,804
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Sit down.</font>

647
00:39:14,374 --> 00:39:15,434
<font color="yellow">This is for you.</font>

648
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,274
<font color="yellow">Anyway, congratulations on starting a business.</font>

649
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,334
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

650
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:23,474
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

651
00:39:24,304 --> 00:39:27,304
<font color="yellow">Everyone got reinstated?</font>

652
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:28,834
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

653
00:39:29,074 --> 00:39:30,674
<font color="yellow">When the new owner took over,</font>

654
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:33,404
<font color="yellow">whoever wanted to get reinstated got their jobs back including...</font>

655
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,304
<font color="yellow">employees on the waitlist and who voluntarily resigned.</font>

656
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:36,934
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

657
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:39,204
<font color="yellow">why wasn't I reinstated?</font>

658
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:42,974
<font color="yellow">I heard that you already had a job at that time.</font>

659
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:45,044
<font color="yellow">Where did you work?</font>

660
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:46,704
<font color="yellow">Woori Daily News?</font>

661
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:51,004
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

662
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:00,074
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

663
00:40:00,474 --> 00:40:02,274
<font color="yellow">who is the new owner?</font>

664
00:40:02,474 --> 00:40:03,604
<font color="yellow">I don't know much about him.</font>

665
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:07,204
<font color="yellow">He doesn't come to the company. His proxy comes often.</font>

666
00:40:08,134 --> 00:40:09,134
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

667
00:40:16,074 --> 00:40:17,104
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han.</font>

668
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,004
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee.</font>

669
00:40:20,874 --> 00:40:22,074
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

670
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:25,104
<font color="yellow">- You're here to pick up the food. - Yes.</font>

671
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,104
<font color="yellow">- Sun Mi. - Yes?</font>

672
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:37,474
<font color="yellow">- Here you go. - Thank you.</font>

673
00:40:38,004 --> 00:40:40,104
<font color="yellow">I'm always grateful for your help.</font>

674
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,474
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it.</font>

675
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,274
<font color="yellow">The workers at the construction site...</font>

676
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:45,704
<font color="yellow">always praise your fried chicken.</font>

677
00:40:47,174 --> 00:40:49,704
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, then. - Goodbye.</font>

678
00:40:53,804 --> 00:40:55,174
<font color="yellow">- Take care. - Goodbye.</font>

679
00:41:15,204 --> 00:41:16,374
<font color="yellow">So I have a question.</font>

680
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:17,974
<font color="yellow">When you were working at the company,</font>

681
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:21,204
<font color="yellow">you were investigating about corruption...</font>

682
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,934
<font color="yellow">between Senior Secretary and Seonghan Group, right?</font>

683
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:26,774
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Do you have the materials?</font>

684
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:29,604
<font color="yellow">I still have the files on my computer. Why?</font>

685
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:34,544
<font color="yellow">Can you give me the files?</font>

686
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:37,774
<font color="yellow">I got reinstated.</font>

687
00:41:37,774 --> 00:41:40,204
<font color="yellow">I should make a mark in order...</font>

688
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:42,804
<font color="yellow">for me to strengthen my position.</font>

689
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:47,074
<font color="yellow">Reporter Han. Please let me have the files.</font>

690
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,334
<font color="yellow">This is expedient,</font>

691
00:41:56,904 --> 00:41:58,734
<font color="yellow">but if you liquidate your existing company,</font>

692
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,804
<font color="yellow">you may be able to avoid charges against the company.</font>

693
00:42:00,904 --> 00:42:01,974
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

694
00:42:10,774 --> 00:42:13,404
<font color="yellow">I see. I didn't know I had an option.</font>

695
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:17,404
<font color="yellow">The president of Seonghan Group will certainly like this.</font>

696
00:42:17,634 --> 00:42:19,104
<font color="yellow">How about the compensation for the victims?</font>

697
00:42:19,834 --> 00:42:21,774
<font color="yellow">You will compensate them, right?</font>

698
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:25,544
<font color="yellow">That's up to the president.</font>

699
00:42:26,104 --> 00:42:29,604
<font color="yellow">All you need to do is to inform us about the loopholes.</font>

700
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:32,134
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

701
00:42:34,574 --> 00:42:35,904
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

702
00:42:36,044 --> 00:42:39,104
<font color="yellow">nominate you in the upcoming election.</font>

703
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:41,174
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

704
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:43,704
<font color="yellow">Are you serious?</font>

705
00:42:44,334 --> 00:42:47,974
<font color="yellow">How can you live with only a lawyer office?</font>

706
00:42:48,604 --> 00:42:51,634
<font color="yellow">Men must think of the big picture.</font>

707
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:56,734
<font color="yellow">So all you need to do is do what I ask you to do.</font>

708
00:42:57,634 --> 00:42:59,874
<font color="yellow">Yes, I will.</font>

709
00:43:00,474 --> 00:43:02,674
<font color="yellow">I will be loyal to you...</font>

710
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:04,204
<font color="yellow">with everything I have.</font>

711
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:09,774
<font color="yellow">I like your office,</font>

712
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:13,074
<font color="yellow">but I keep smelling food.</font>

713
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:18,904
<font color="yellow">It smells like friend chicken, doesn't it?</font>

714
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,474
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

715
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,434
<font color="yellow">Okay. Reporter Han. Take care.</font>

716
00:43:24,574 --> 00:43:27,334
<font color="yellow">Don't forget what I asked you, please.</font>

717
00:43:43,434 --> 00:43:45,634
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

718
00:43:46,434 --> 00:43:48,404
<font color="yellow">I will visit you soon.</font>

719
00:43:48,534 --> 00:43:50,104
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take care.</font>

720
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:51,734
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I will.</font>

721
00:43:52,134 --> 00:43:53,374
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

722
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:00,704
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

723
00:44:01,034 --> 00:44:02,104
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

724
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,204
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

725
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:05,774
<font color="yellow">Why are you saying goodbye so slavishly?</font>

726
00:44:05,974 --> 00:44:08,104
<font color="yellow">I can't live because of you.</font>

727
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:09,734
<font color="yellow">- What? - Do you want to...</font>

728
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:13,574
<font color="yellow">fry chickens when your brother is having the most important moment?</font>

729
00:44:13,574 --> 00:44:15,874
<font color="yellow">What would I do if I don't fry chickens?</font>

730
00:44:15,874 --> 00:44:17,774
<font color="yellow">Don't go overboard with it.</font>

731
00:44:17,774 --> 00:44:20,834
<font color="yellow">I'm trying to make a living just as much as you are.</font>

732
00:44:21,074 --> 00:44:22,474
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking to me like this?</font>

733
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,674
<font color="yellow">Look. I am going to do something big.</font>

734
00:44:25,674 --> 00:44:28,704
<font color="yellow">Then I am going to get rid of your fried chicken restaurant.</font>

735
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:31,974
<font color="yellow">No, I will buy the whole building.</font>

736
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:34,374
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kick you out. Did you get that?</font>

737
00:44:34,504 --> 00:44:35,674
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

738
00:44:36,404 --> 00:44:39,204
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to your brother like that?</font>

739
00:44:39,374 --> 00:44:42,604
<font color="yellow">I'm going to tell Mom on you. I'm telling Mom.</font>

740
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:44,474
<font color="yellow">Okay. Do that. Tell Mom on me.</font>

741
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,434
<font color="yellow">Tell on me. Tell her.</font>

742
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,904
<font color="yellow">- You, little brat. - Seong Hoon, let me go.</font>

743
00:44:48,904 --> 00:44:51,274
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Why don't we...</font>

744
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:55,174
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to rip off your ears. - You're going to hurt my ears.</font>

745
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:58,674
<font color="yellow">Are you not going upstairs to check on your granddaughter tonight?</font>

746
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:02,674
<font color="yellow">She will come home late since she has a company dinner tonight.</font>

747
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:05,104
<font color="yellow">- Is that so? - Yes.</font>

748
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:07,204
<font color="yellow">That means Seong Joon will be late as well.</font>

749
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,374
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

750
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:12,404
<font color="yellow">Good for them.</font>

751
00:45:12,774 --> 00:45:13,974
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

752
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:16,134
<font color="yellow">They live in the same house and work in the same company.</font>

753
00:45:16,134 --> 00:45:18,604
<font color="yellow">They go to work together and come home together.</font>

754
00:45:18,834 --> 00:45:21,874
<font color="yellow">They won't be bored. How nice.</font>

755
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,004
<font color="yellow">Isn't it?</font>

756
00:45:24,374 --> 00:45:25,534
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang.</font>

757
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:29,374
<font color="yellow">Why are you so bored?</font>

758
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,674
<font color="yellow">Is being bored your talking point these days?</font>

759
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:34,834
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

760
00:45:35,034 --> 00:45:37,104
<font color="yellow">If you are bored,</font>

761
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:40,534
<font color="yellow">why don't you accompany when I go to clean the staircase?</font>

762
00:45:40,534 --> 00:45:43,504
<font color="yellow">I'm saying this...</font>

763
00:45:43,504 --> 00:45:45,534
<font color="yellow">because I am jealous of...</font>

764
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:48,534
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon and Dong Hui.</font>

765
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:51,604
<font color="yellow">In addition, she now has a workroom.</font>

766
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:54,804
<font color="yellow">They will be chatting away in that workroom.</font>

767
00:45:55,174 --> 00:45:57,304
<font color="yellow">That must be a lot of fun.</font>

768
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,104
<font color="yellow">You go out early in the morning and come home late at night.</font>

769
00:46:01,504 --> 00:46:04,504
<font color="yellow">Then go and ask them to let you join them.</font>

770
00:46:06,204 --> 00:46:09,604
<font color="yellow">When I was young, I lived in the countryside.</font>

771
00:46:10,274 --> 00:46:12,604
<font color="yellow">On the way home from school,</font>

772
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:16,074
<font color="yellow">there was a house that raised a big dog.</font>

773
00:46:16,334 --> 00:46:19,074
<font color="yellow">It was so scary to pass by that house.</font>

774
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:22,404
<font color="yellow">As soon as I stepped out of school, I started to worry about it,</font>

775
00:46:22,804 --> 00:46:26,474
<font color="yellow">but I still had to pass by that house.</font>

776
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,774
<font color="yellow">At that moment,</font>

777
00:46:29,774 --> 00:46:32,734
<font color="yellow">a boy from my class was standing there.</font>

778
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:38,004
<font color="yellow">- So? - So I asked him...</font>

779
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:40,274
<font color="yellow">to take me with him.</font>

780
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,634
<font color="yellow">Every day since then,</font>

781
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,734
<font color="yellow">that boy...</font>

782
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:48,734
<font color="yellow">stood there at that time.</font>

783
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:51,274
<font color="yellow">What's your point?</font>

784
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,474
<font color="yellow">We walked back together for about six months.</font>

785
00:46:54,974 --> 00:46:58,204
<font color="yellow">After the six months, he confessed his feelings.</font>

786
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,334
<font color="yellow">He said he intentionally stood there at that hour...</font>

787
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:03,434
<font color="yellow">because he had a crush on me.</font>

788
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:07,674
<font color="yellow">Goodness, it turned out that his home was on the opposite side.</font>

789
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,734
<font color="yellow">But he did that just for me.</font>

790
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:14,604
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

791
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:22,834
<font color="yellow">What if Seong Joon falls for Dong Hui?</font>

792
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:24,904
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

793
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,634
<font color="yellow">We can't predict young kids these days.</font>

794
00:47:28,374 --> 00:47:31,704
<font color="yellow">That shouldn't happen. My daughter-in-law will be mad.</font>

795
00:47:32,174 --> 00:47:33,574
<font color="yellow">She will go crazy.</font>

796
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,474
<font color="yellow">She thoroughly planned to marry him off...</font>

797
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:42,074
<font color="yellow">that millionaire girl who visited us the other time.</font>

798
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:45,534
<font color="yellow">Hey! Stop talking nonsense.</font>

799
00:47:45,674 --> 00:47:48,804
<font color="yellow">Why would you yell? You really surprised me.</font>

800
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:51,304
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with my Dong Hui?</font>

801
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:53,774
<font color="yellow">When you get to know my Dong Hui,</font>

802
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:57,804
<font color="yellow">you will see that she doesn't lack anything.</font>

803
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:00,174
<font color="yellow">He's just a director anyway.</font>

804
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:02,904
<font color="yellow">What did you say? "Just a director"?</font>

805
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:07,974
<font color="yellow">It's smaller and cozier than I thought. It's nice.</font>

806
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:10,074
<font color="yellow">Is this Hyung Seop's work?</font>

807
00:48:10,274 --> 00:48:12,574
<font color="yellow">Yes. He worked hard on it.</font>

808
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:15,204
<font color="yellow">Now you just have to write well. Right?</font>

809
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:17,074
<font color="yellow">Yes, just like Writer Jo.</font>

810
00:48:18,574 --> 00:48:21,604
<font color="yellow">Right. You have to be like her, too.</font>

811
00:48:25,204 --> 00:48:26,204
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

812
00:48:27,774 --> 00:48:29,574
<font color="yellow">anyway, you have to write well,</font>

813
00:48:29,874 --> 00:48:31,904
<font color="yellow">stay healthy, and be happy.</font>

814
00:48:33,104 --> 00:48:34,674
<font color="yellow">Yes, I should.</font>

815
00:48:39,204 --> 00:48:41,504
<font color="yellow">By the way, I saw...</font>

816
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:44,134
<font color="yellow">a totally different side of Director Bang.</font>

817
00:48:46,574 --> 00:48:50,434
<font color="yellow">She was singing and playing tambourine.</font>

818
00:48:50,674 --> 00:48:53,204
<font color="yellow">I've never seen her trying so hard to please someone.</font>

819
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:56,434
<font color="yellow">I thought she doesn't know how to do that.</font>

820
00:48:56,874 --> 00:49:00,004
<font color="yellow">That's Director Bang's strength. We should learn that from her.</font>

821
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,004
<font color="yellow">- What? - She doesn't...</font>

822
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:06,434
<font color="yellow">always stay arrogant and stuck-up like other rich girls.</font>

823
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:08,774
<font color="yellow">She's a professional when she works.</font>

824
00:49:09,204 --> 00:49:11,504
<font color="yellow">That's Director Bang's big strength.</font>

825
00:49:13,674 --> 00:49:14,734
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

826
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:23,134
<font color="yellow">It's freezing. Why did soy sauce have to run out at night?</font>

827
00:49:23,934 --> 00:49:25,204
<font color="yellow">I need it to marinate meat.</font>

828
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:41,134
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

829
00:49:42,904 --> 00:49:45,434
<font color="yellow">- Goodnight. - Bye.</font>

830
00:49:46,674 --> 00:49:47,874
<font color="yellow">Write a lot, too.</font>

831
00:49:48,674 --> 00:49:49,704
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

832
00:49:52,174 --> 00:49:53,174
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

833
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:01,604
<font color="yellow">Why are you coming out from there? You should've come home.</font>

834
00:50:02,704 --> 00:50:03,734
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

835
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:07,974
<font color="yellow">I dropped by because Dong Hui got a studio.</font>

836
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:10,774
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Still, how can you visit...</font>

837
00:50:11,204 --> 00:50:12,834
<font color="yellow">a lady's room at this hour?</font>

838
00:50:14,374 --> 00:50:16,934
<font color="yellow">I came here before to check her writing.</font>

839
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:19,974
<font color="yellow">Stop it. It's so embarrassing.</font>

840
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,534
<font color="yellow">Even though you are in-laws who live in the same house,</font>

841
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:25,834
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't enter a young lady's room in the middle of night.</font>

842
00:50:28,534 --> 00:50:32,574
<font color="yellow">You're just as bad. You should have asked him to come during the day.</font>

843
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,934
<font color="yellow">You work in the same office. Why didn't you ask him at the office?</font>

844
00:50:34,934 --> 00:50:37,834
<font color="yellow">Why would you call him to your room? I think this is wrong.</font>

845
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:41,174
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I will be more careful next time.</font>

846
00:50:43,804 --> 00:50:46,634
<font color="yellow">Rumors travel fast in this town. Please be more careful.</font>

847
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:50,304
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Come on down, Seong Joon.</font>

848
00:50:51,534 --> 00:50:52,534
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

849
00:51:07,974 --> 00:51:08,974
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

850
00:51:20,134 --> 00:51:22,174
<font color="yellow">What? So what did you say?</font>

851
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:26,804
<font color="yellow">What do you think? I said I am going to teach her a lesson.</font>

852
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:31,804
<font color="yellow">Goodness. She's not wrong though.</font>

853
00:51:32,074 --> 00:51:33,974
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean she's not wrong? - Hey.</font>

854
00:51:34,274 --> 00:51:37,434
<font color="yellow">Put on some more.</font>

855
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:40,874
<font color="yellow">Frying chicken is not easy.</font>

856
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,204
<font color="yellow">Did you think it was going to be easy?</font>

857
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:50,704
<font color="yellow">Like what she said, the kids might get bullied.</font>

858
00:51:53,274 --> 00:51:57,204
<font color="yellow">This is something that only happens in dramas. It's a mess.</font>

859
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:01,504
<font color="yellow">I agree with you on that.</font>

860
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:07,104
<font color="yellow">Like what Hee Sook said, you should be Chang Soo's mom for now.</font>

861
00:52:07,904 --> 00:52:10,404
<font color="yellow">Tell Hee Sook to continue being Ji Hoon's mom.</font>

862
00:52:10,804 --> 00:52:13,574
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - We just have to do well at home.</font>

863
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:14,934
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter.</font>

864
00:52:15,904 --> 00:52:19,634
<font color="yellow">And send the kids to different high schools.</font>

865
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:21,774
<font color="yellow">Then you can be Ji Hoon's mom again.</font>

866
00:52:22,874 --> 00:52:23,874
<font color="yellow">That's better.</font>

867
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:27,504
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

868
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:32,574
<font color="yellow">What did you just say? Where did you say you're going?</font>

869
00:52:32,934 --> 00:52:33,934
<font color="yellow">To a church.</font>

870
00:52:34,334 --> 00:52:37,104
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

871
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:41,604
<font color="yellow">Your school resumes soon. You should study a little more...</font>

872
00:52:41,634 --> 00:52:45,604
<font color="yellow">and think about getting better grades next year.</font>

873
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:51,474
<font color="yellow">Why on earth do you want to go there?</font>

874
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,304
<font color="yellow">I made a promise a long time ago.</font>

875
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,804
<font color="yellow">We're going to have a charity concert at the church.</font>

876
00:52:56,704 --> 00:52:58,434
<font color="yellow">- No. - Mom.</font>

877
00:52:59,074 --> 00:53:00,474
<font color="yellow">I said no.</font>

878
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:05,174
<font color="yellow">You are the unfortunate person, and I should be comforted.</font>

879
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:12,034
<font color="yellow">That's going to be counted as extra credit on the third grade.</font>

880
00:53:13,974 --> 00:53:14,974
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

881
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:17,904
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

882
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:21,304
<font color="yellow">He always thinks about a way to avoid studying.</font>

883
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:39,674
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hey.</font>

884
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:43,874
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you're coming to the moms' get-together.</font>

885
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:47,904
<font color="yellow">I told you I can't go. I'm not feeling well.</font>

886
00:53:48,204 --> 00:53:49,504
<font color="yellow">I can't join today.</font>

887
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:53,704
<font color="yellow">And starting this year, I won't be the leader. Choose another one.</font>

888
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:56,134
<font color="yellow">You should at least come today.</font>

889
00:53:56,304 --> 00:53:59,604
<font color="yellow">You have to settle the fees from last year and hand it over.</font>

890
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:00,704
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

891
00:54:01,574 --> 00:54:04,634
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy? Why would you get an exorcism?</font>

892
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:06,604
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

893
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:08,834
<font color="yellow">Don't do that.</font>

894
00:54:09,634 --> 00:54:11,874
<font color="yellow">Try to relax.</font>

895
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,174
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

896
00:54:16,174 --> 00:54:18,534
<font color="yellow">Mal Ja. Mal Ja.</font>

897
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,174
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

898
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:25,734
<font color="yellow">- It's Mal Ja. - What's wrong with her?</font>

899
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:28,504
<font color="yellow">I'm glad you came. Have a seat.</font>

900
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:36,634
<font color="yellow">Mal Ja is causing me much trouble.</font>

901
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,734
<font color="yellow">Because of what happened to Mi Ja's store...</font>

902
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:42,834
<font color="yellow">and Guem Ja's academy,</font>

906

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

907
00:54:56,604 --> 00:54:58,604
<font color="yellow">I've never heard that kind of hideous story.</font>

908

<font color="yellow">We didn't push him to die.</font>

909

<font color="yellow">We didn't.</font>

910

912

<font color="yellow">He may go.</font>

919
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:58,334
<font color="yellow">And near him</font>

920
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:02,674
<font color="yellow">I always will be.</font>

921
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:08,434
<font color="yellow">For nothing can keep me away.</font>

922
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:14,734
<font color="yellow">He is my destiny</font>

923
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:19,134
<font color="yellow">I love him, I love him, I love him.</font>

924

<font color="yellow">I will follow him.</font>

926
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:29,674
<font color="yellow">Follow him where ever he may go.</font>

927
00:56:29,774 --> 00:56:32,934
<font color="yellow">There isn't an ocean too deep.</font>

928
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:35,504
<font color="yellow">A mountain so high it can keep.</font>

929
00:56:35,504 --> 00:56:38,634
<font color="yellow">- Keep me away - Together, together.</font>

930

931
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:45,474
<font color="yellow">Follow him where ever he may go.</font>

932

<font color="yellow">- There isn't an ocean too deep - Too deep.</font>

933
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:51,504
<font color="yellow">- A mountain so high it can keep - A mountain so high it can keep.</font>

934
00:56:51,504 --> 00:56:54,474
<font color="yellow">- Keep us away - Keep us away.</font>

935
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:57,704
<font color="yellow">- Away from his love - Away from his love.</font>

936
00:56:59,674 --> 00:57:02,704
<font color="yellow">- Oh yes, I love him - I'll follow.</font>

937
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:05,734
<font color="yellow">- I'm going to follow - True love.</font>

949
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,434
<font color="yellow">You promised to feed Chang Soo fried chicken as I'm joining you.</font>

950
00:58:04,304 --> 00:58:07,934
<font color="yellow">Make sure Ji Hoon completes his English workbook within this week.</font>

951
00:58:08,934 --> 00:58:12,034
<font color="yellow">- You still haven't changed. - Let's go.</font>

952
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:20,334
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello. You're here.</font>

953
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,404
<font color="yellow">It's good to see you.</font>

954
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:27,804
<font color="yellow">Our children are now in their third grade.</font>

955
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:30,204
<font color="yellow">No matter what kind of high school they may want to go,</font>

956
00:58:30,204 --> 00:58:32,974
<font color="yellow">we, mothers, should put our heads together...</font>

957
00:58:32,974 --> 00:58:35,734
<font color="yellow">and work out a strategy to help them get into...</font>

958
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:37,104
<font color="yellow">the school they want to go.</font>

959
00:58:37,774 --> 00:58:40,334
<font color="yellow">The admission process of specialized high schools...</font>

960
00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:43,434
<font color="yellow">is expected to remain the same this year.</font>

961
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,174
<font color="yellow">However, we must not get manipulated by the schools' announcements...</font>

962
00:58:47,174 --> 00:58:49,574
<font color="yellow">or the instigation of the press...</font>

963
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:53,334
<font color="yellow">that the level of difficulty will remain unchanged.</font>

964
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:05,834
<font color="yellow">Now, we have to come up with an original...</font>

965
00:59:05,974 --> 00:59:08,704
<font color="yellow">learning strategy that will be shared only with...</font>

966
00:59:08,704 --> 00:59:10,274
<font color="yellow">us and our children.</font>

967
00:59:10,534 --> 00:59:12,004
<font color="yellow">We should be fully prepare our children,</font>

968
00:59:12,004 --> 00:59:14,634
<font color="yellow">so that they can get the best score...</font>

969
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,204
<font color="yellow">under any circumstances.</font>

970
00:59:16,474 --> 00:59:17,534
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which,</font>

971
00:59:18,474 --> 00:59:20,434
<font color="yellow">I invited Mr. Kim Tae Pyung,</font>

972
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:23,104
<font color="yellow">a teacher at a famous academy in Gangnam...</font>

973
00:59:23,204 --> 00:59:24,834
<font color="yellow">to join us next week.</font>

974
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:26,474
<font color="yellow">- Really? - That's wonderful.</font>

975
00:59:26,504 --> 00:59:27,774
<font color="yellow">That's really great.</font>

976
00:59:28,004 --> 00:59:29,434
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

977
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:31,034
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

978
00:59:35,734 --> 00:59:36,874
<font color="yellow">Look, Chang Soo's mom.</font>

979
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:38,074
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Yes?</font>

980
00:59:42,434 --> 00:59:44,604
<font color="yellow">Why did you answer me at the same time?</font>

981
00:59:48,204 --> 00:59:50,704
<font color="yellow">We actually live in the same house.</font>

982
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:51,974
<font color="yellow">We sometimes get confused.</font>

983
00:59:52,704 --> 00:59:56,334
<font color="yellow">- Is that so, Ji Hoon's mom? - That's right.</font>

984
00:59:58,074 --> 01:00:01,834
<font color="yellow">What are you two doing? Just explain about the rumor.</font>

985
01:00:06,504 --> 01:00:08,734
<font color="yellow">There is no rumor.</font>

986
01:00:08,804 --> 01:00:11,374
<font color="yellow">The kids were just joking around. It's hardly a rumor.</font>

987
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:16,104
<font color="yellow">My son, Chang Soo is very insensible.</font>

988
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:20,134
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon is under a lot of stress because of studying.</font>

989
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:23,334
<font color="yellow">I knew she was not just any ordinary woman...</font>

990
01:00:23,904 --> 01:00:25,704
<font color="yellow">when I first saw her.</font>

991
01:00:26,634 --> 01:00:28,374
<font color="yellow">- Me? Why? - Gosh.</font>

992
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:32,134
<font color="yellow">I heard you were a manager of a department at a big makeup brand.</font>

993
01:00:32,734 --> 01:00:35,404
<font color="yellow">Also, you graduated from Seoul National University, right?</font>

994
01:00:35,404 --> 01:00:37,204
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. Seoul National University? - Seoul National University?</font>

995
01:00:39,634 --> 01:00:42,634
<font color="yellow">I think there has been a misunderstanding.</font>

996
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:45,734
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo really is my son.</font>

997
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:48,404
<font color="yellow">No wonder Ji Hoon is so smart.</font>

998
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:50,474
<font color="yellow">- What? - I knew it.</font>

999
01:00:50,474 --> 01:00:52,204
<font color="yellow">We thought it was strange, too.</font>

1000
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,404
<font color="yellow">It didn't make sense that a son of...</font>

1001
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:57,034
<font color="yellow">a Seoul National University graduate got the worst grades.</font>

1002
01:00:57,874 --> 01:00:59,534
<font color="yellow">It's unnatural.</font>

1003
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:03,874
<font color="yellow">- Look. - Kids get as smart as their mom.</font>

1004
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:05,704
<font color="yellow">They get the grades their mom got,</font>

1005
01:01:05,804 --> 01:01:07,934
<font color="yellow">and go to the university their mom went to.</font>

1006
01:01:10,074 --> 01:01:12,334
<font color="yellow">People who graduated from a bad university...</font>

1007
01:01:12,674 --> 01:01:15,074
<font color="yellow">only write the name of their graduate school on the paper.</font>

1008
01:01:15,674 --> 01:01:18,334
<font color="yellow">I guess they think it can cover the university they went to.</font>

1009
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:22,004
<font color="yellow">- Look. - Someone here turned out to be...</font>

1010
01:01:22,074 --> 01:01:23,804
<font color="yellow">a local university graduate,</font>

1011
01:01:23,904 --> 01:01:26,204
<font color="yellow">but she could put on airs thanks to her fake son.</font>

1012
01:01:27,674 --> 01:01:31,404
<font color="yellow">Hey! Don't you think you're going too far?</font>

1013
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:33,134
<font color="yellow">Please stay seated, Hye Joo.</font>

1014
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,434
<font color="yellow">- She's right. - Please sit.</font>

1015
01:01:36,374 --> 01:01:38,034
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

1016
01:01:38,604 --> 01:01:40,834
<font color="yellow">You're being too harsh!</font>

1017
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:43,574
<font color="yellow">- You're such shameless women. - Hye Joo.</font>

1018
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:45,334
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

1019
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:51,774
<font color="yellow">That's right!</font>

1020
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:54,174
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo, the one who...</font>

1021
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:56,304
<font color="yellow">gets the worst grades is my son.</font>

1022
01:01:56,474 --> 01:01:59,404
<font color="yellow">I'm Chang Soo's mother. What are you going to do?</font>

1023
01:02:14,004 --> 01:02:20,774
<font color="yellow">(Lee Jae Cheol)</font>

1024
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:23,004
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

1025
01:02:25,334 --> 01:02:27,474
<font color="yellow">I just came by to see you.</font>

1026
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,074
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

1027

<font color="yellow">You're here, you brat.</font>

1028
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:13,674
<font color="yellow">Why did you drink so much, Dad?</font>

1029
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:15,834
<font color="yellow">You should stop drinking.</font>

1030
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:17,774
<font color="yellow">Put it back.</font>

1031
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:21,104
<font color="yellow">Why can't I drink as much as I like? You brat.</font>

1032

<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

1033

<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

1034
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,404
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - That hurts.</font>

1035
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:32,774
<font color="yellow">You're my son, you brat.</font>

1036
01:03:35,934 --> 01:03:38,874
<font color="yellow">Since you're here, do you want to have a drink?</font>

1037
01:03:39,204 --> 01:03:40,634
<font color="yellow">I'm fine.</font>

1038
01:03:41,074 --> 01:03:42,274

01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:45,674
<font color="yellow">My gosh, Dad.</font>

1040
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:48,734
<font color="yellow">- Have a drink. - All right.</font>

1041
01:03:49,604 --> 01:03:51,874
<font color="yellow">- Is this your glass or mine? - That's yours.</font>

1042

<font color="yellow">- Is this mine? - It is.</font>

1043
01:03:56,474 --> 01:03:57,774
<font color="yellow">Dad. Be careful.</font>

1044
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:01,704
<font color="yellow">I'm all right.</font>

1045
01:04:02,774 --> 01:04:05,074
<font color="yellow">I'm all right!</font>

1046
01:04:06,474 --> 01:04:08,634
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have drunk so much.</font>

1047
01:04:13,104 --> 01:04:14,734
<font color="yellow">You punk. I'm going to kill you today.</font>

1048
01:04:14,734 --> 01:04:17,174
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Please forgive me.</font>

1049

<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Forgive me.</font>

1051

1052
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:29,174
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it on purpose. Please believe me.</font>

1053
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:33,204
<font color="yellow">- No one will believe you! - You deserve this!</font>

1054
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:37,134
<font color="yellow">- He needs a good beating! - What a jerk!</font>

1055
01:04:43,804 --> 01:04:46,604
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry, Seong Joon. - What?</font>

1056
01:04:47,004 --> 01:04:50,074
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Okay.</font>

1057
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:55,104

01:05:15,504 --> 01:05:16,804
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.</font>

1063
01:05:17,604 --> 01:05:18,634
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

1064
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,574
<font color="yellow">I can't take my revenge...</font>

1065

<font color="yellow">They look after each other, care for each other...</font>

1067
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:31,304
<font color="yellow">and enjoy themselves.</font>

1068
01:05:32,834 --> 01:05:34,504
