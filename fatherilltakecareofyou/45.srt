00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han.</font>

2
00:00:40,098 --> 00:00:41,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Find her.</font>

3
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:56,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Did they hurt you?</font>

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been well, right?</font>

5
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

6
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out too late.</font>

7
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:22,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have looked for you before.</font>

8
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:26,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

9
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what's happening.</font>

10
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:33,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm...</font>

11
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:36,168
<font color=#FFFF00>so confused.</font>

12
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

13
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me carefully.</font>

14
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. Just wait for me.</font>

15
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Do what Chairman Bang wants you to do.</font>

16
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:58,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't go against them.</font>

17
00:01:59,568 --> 00:02:02,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Trust me and wait for me.</font>

18
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:04,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do that for me, right?</font>

19
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

20
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:09,468
<font color=#FFFF00>What if that puts you in danger too?</font>

21
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:11,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think that will happen.</font>

22
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I will resolve this problem by all means.</font>

23
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make sure to...</font>

24
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,298
<font color=#FFFF00>get you and your grandmother out of that house.</font>

25
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I missed you.</font>

26
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I missed you too.</font>

27
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,698
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 45)</font>

28
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:55,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened? What's the matter?</font>

29
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:58,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui disappeared.</font>

30
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,028
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

31
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:03,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What were you doing?</font>

32
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:06,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you kidding me? Go find her.</font>

33
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:07,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.</font>

34
00:03:08,428 --> 00:03:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

35
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

36
00:03:16,068 --> 00:03:17,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you receive the script I sent you?</font>

37
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:19,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

38
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:21,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You did a very good job.</font>

39
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:25,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Once you get home,</font>

40
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:27,898
<font color=#FFFF00>don't worry about anything and just work on your script.</font>

41
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

42
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:32,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. But...</font>

43
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Just listen to me.</font>

44
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,328
<font color=#FFFF00>And take good care of Ms. Oh.</font>

45
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:01,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

46
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:04,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you.</font>

47
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:09,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you too.</font>

48
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:22,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

49
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:29,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she left the building.</font>

50
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:32,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - I can't find her anywhere.</font>

51
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:34,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

52
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>There she is.</font>

53
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

54
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:53,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been?</font>

55
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to the bathroom. Why?</font>

56
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:04,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have told me before going to the bathroom.</font>

57
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,328
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let's go. - Yes, sir.</font>

58
00:05:47,328 --> 00:05:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who are you? - Well...</font>

59
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:52,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm from FGC.</font>

60
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I talk to her for a minute? - Okay.</font>

61
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park Chang Wook.</font>

62
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

63
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:19,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm Han Seong Joon. Ms. Oh Gui Boon asked me to come and see you.</font>

64
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:26,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to help you.</font>

65
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

66
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Choi Jin Sung is...</font>

67
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:40,268
<font color=#FFFF00>all that remains.</font>

68
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:42,898
<font color=#FFFF00>He is the key figure.</font>

69
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,328
<font color=#FFFF00>If Director Choi helps us,</font>

70
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,428
<font color=#FFFF00>things would be a lot easier.</font>

71
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,898
<font color=#FFFF00>What did the chairwoman say?</font>

72
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,328
<font color=#FFFF00>If all the people on the list resigned from the company,</font>

73
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:57,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get the key from Ms. Oh, unlock the safe...</font>

74
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and hand everything in it to Bang Gwang Jin, she said.</font>

75
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>She's trying to raise the stakes.</font>

76
00:08:06,368 --> 00:08:07,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

77
00:08:07,768 --> 00:08:10,668
<font color=#FFFF00>on the day Bang Gwang Jin announces the renewed will,</font>

78
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:14,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park will return to the company.</font>

79
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:22,428
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

80
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,528
<font color=#FFFF00>the key to the safe.</font>

81
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:27,228
<font color=#FFFF00>She set you...</font>

82
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,668
<font color=#FFFF00>such a heavy burden.</font>

83
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:39,568
<font color=#FFFF00>There are Chairwoman Park's will...</font>

84
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:42,298
<font color=#FFFF00>and the truth about Bang Hyun Jeong who is supposedly dead.</font>

85
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:44,828
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a secret...</font>

86
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,068
<font color=#FFFF00>that they've tried to keep for their entire lives.</font>

87
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

88
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>take good care of it.</font>

89
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

90
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,268
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you keep your old mother...</font>

91
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,728
<font color=#FFFF00>locked up like that?</font>

92
00:09:08,138 --> 00:09:09,868
<font color=#FFFF00>That's so inhumane.</font>

93
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:11,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off me.</font>

94
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:12,998
<font color=#FFFF00>All the women in our family...</font>

95
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,028
<font color=#FFFF00>are so talkative.</font>

96
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:17,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been?</font>

97
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:20,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...</font>

98
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:22,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to see your grandmother.</font>

99
00:09:22,498 --> 00:09:23,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

100
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:26,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew it, right?</font>

101
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You knew the whole thing.</font>

102
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:33,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

103
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:37,138
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys are so terrible.</font>

104
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:40,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How could a son and a granddaughter...</font>

105
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:43,828
<font color=#FFFF00>lock their mother and grandmother...</font>

106
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>in a mountain for 20 years?</font>

107
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:49,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth do you gain from this?</font>

108
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:51,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut your mouth.</font>

109
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,368
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you say such a thing to us?</font>

110
00:09:53,368 --> 00:09:56,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You should shut your mouth. You know I'm older than you!</font>

111
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,598
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so noisy. Just stop the quarrel.</font>

112
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,598
<font color=#FFFF00>So are you the one...</font>

113
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:05,928
<font color=#FFFF00>who killed my dad...</font>

114
00:10:06,468 --> 00:10:07,698
<font color=#FFFF00>and mom?</font>

115
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,198
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not it. I told you I didn't do that.</font>

116
00:10:11,138 --> 00:10:12,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm under a false accusation.</font>

117
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

118
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't do this.</font>

119
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,868
<font color=#FFFF00>It just doesn't make sense.</font>

120
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:22,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me, Chairman Bang.</font>

121
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:23,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo.</font>

122
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:26,368
<font color=#FFFF00>As I said before,</font>

123
00:10:26,768 --> 00:10:28,638
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not interested...</font>

124
00:10:28,638 --> 00:10:30,528
<font color=#FFFF00>in the money, power, and reputation.</font>

125
00:10:30,668 --> 00:10:32,098
<font color=#FFFF00>They are no better than trash to me.</font>

126
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:35,268
<font color=#FFFF00>So let me and my grandmother...</font>

127
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,398
<font color=#FFFF00>get out of here immediately.</font>

128
00:10:37,868 --> 00:10:39,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What have we done wrong?</font>

129
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:42,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I've known nothing all my life.</font>

130
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:46,568
<font color=#FFFF00>And my grandmother has lived in adversity until now...</font>

131
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:47,898
<font color=#FFFF00>just for Chairwoman Park.</font>

132
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,728
<font color=#FFFF00>We will live in obscurity...</font>

133
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:54,698
<font color=#FFFF00>as we have done so far.</font>

134
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:56,968
<font color=#FFFF00>So please let us out.</font>

135
00:11:01,598 --> 00:11:02,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it.</font>

136
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:06,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to let you out anyway.</font>

137
00:11:06,628 --> 00:11:08,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park will rewrite...</font>

138
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,768
<font color=#FFFF00>her will pretty soon.</font>

139
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:12,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Just wait quietly until then.</font>

140
00:11:12,868 --> 00:11:15,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to keep you here anymore.</font>

141
00:11:16,198 --> 00:11:17,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Send her up to her room.</font>

142
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:20,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerks.</font>

143
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,368
<font color=#FFFF00>All of you will pay for this.</font>

144
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:24,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You will be punished for this.</font>

145
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:27,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Mi Joo, I'm not going to be sitting still.</font>

146
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:29,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off me!</font>

147
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,668
<font color=#FFFF00>- Gosh. - Dad.</font>

148
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you take Dong Hui there?</font>

149
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:37,798
<font color=#FFFF00>It is the easiest way to change your grandmother's mind.</font>

150
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:39,028
<font color=#FFFF00>So what?</font>

151
00:11:39,268 --> 00:11:41,098
<font color=#FFFF00>If she rewrites her will,</font>

152
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,268
<font color=#FFFF00>what will happen to Dong Hui?</font>

153
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,598
<font color=#FFFF00>It's simple.</font>

154
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:47,498
<font color=#FFFF00>She just said that.</font>

155
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:49,198
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll live as Oh Dong Hui.</font>

156
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:50,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it even possible?</font>

157
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You know she's Bang Hyun Jeong.</font>

158
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:56,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh Dong Hui is Bang Hyun Jeong. So what?</font>

159
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:59,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be getting all the money and stocks...</font>

160
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:01,868
<font color=#FFFF00>for Bang Hyun Jeong.</font>

161
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:05,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jeong will be just an empty shell.</font>

162
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,528
<font color=#FFFF00>She'll be useless.</font>

163
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, please.</font>

164
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:13,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see them anymore.</font>

165
00:12:14,798 --> 00:12:17,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Just wait a little longer.</font>

166
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything will be over soon.</font>

167
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

168
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:33,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Make some noise when you get in the house.</font>

169
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you weren't interested.</font>

170
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You were doing some research about UN Production.</font>

171
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:41,398
<font color=#FFFF00>That's just my job...</font>

172
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,668
<font color=#FFFF00>to analyze companies.</font>

173
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:44,168
<font color=#FFFF00>As a matter of fact,</font>

174
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:46,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I've done some research on UN Production.</font>

175
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>As you know, it is a nasty company.</font>

176
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:53,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I believe you should let Sang Woo wash his hands of the matter.</font>

177
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I was just looking.</font>

178
00:12:56,428 --> 00:12:58,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You should sell all the stocks of FGC Group.</font>

179
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:00,968
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no reason to keep them.</font>

180
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:04,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's better to keep them for a little longer.</font>

181
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:06,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

182
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,498
<font color=#FFFF00>According to our agent,</font>

183
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:12,598
<font color=#FFFF00>there's a rumor that Park Chang Wook is coming back.</font>

184
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

185
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:18,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How can the former chairwoman of FGC group come back?</font>

186
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Recently, a rumor has been going around among shareholders...</font>

187
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,998
<font color=#FFFF00>that Chairwoman Park has been found.</font>

188
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Whoever it is, he's recklessly bold.</font>

189
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:31,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

190
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,868
<font color=#FFFF00>The return of the chairwoman...</font>

191
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,998
<font color=#FFFF00>must be a very bad news for Bang Gwang Jin.</font>

192
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:38,668
<font color=#FFFF00>The fact that this rumor is spreading means that...</font>

193
00:13:38,668 --> 00:13:42,128
<font color=#FFFF00>someone's planning to take down Bang Gwang Jin.</font>

194
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:44,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I guess that's possible.</font>

195
00:13:45,528 --> 00:13:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I look into it and find out who's behind it?</font>

196
00:13:47,728 --> 00:13:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>No, there's no need.</font>

197
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:53,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether it's good news or bad news, it doesn't affect us at all.</font>

198
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:56,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Like what you said, we should just sell the stocks...</font>

199
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,198
<font color=#FFFF00>at the right time and go back.</font>

200
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:01,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I will report to you...</font>

201
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:02,728
<font color=#FFFF00>as soon as I get an update.</font>

202
00:14:03,898 --> 00:14:06,468
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what will you do about Sang Woo?</font>

203
00:14:07,228 --> 00:14:08,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I'm not interested.</font>

204
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:10,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Still,</font>

205
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:13,298
<font color=#FFFF00>you have to get him out of UN Production immediately.</font>

206
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,128
<font color=#FFFF00>He's an idiot.</font>

207
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It's...</font>

208
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the old lady who used to live across the street.</font>

209
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Your house is bigger than it looks.</font>

210
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:39,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

211
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:43,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I take a seat?</font>

212
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Take a seat, please.</font>

213
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:49,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want some tea?</font>

214
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need anything.</font>

215
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you sit?</font>

216
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You should sit too, Mr. Gray Hair.</font>

217
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

218
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:10,928
<font color=#FFFF00>These are...</font>

219
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:15,228
<font color=#FFFF00>gochujang and doenjang from our rooftop.</font>

220
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,728
<font color=#FFFF00>These days, men live well...</font>

221
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:19,628
<font color=#FFFF00>even when they live alone.</font>

222
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:23,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't eat just anything because you're alone.</font>

223
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:26,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Store-bought ones are not good.</font>

224
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You should taste ours.</font>

225
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't have to do this.</font>

226
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:36,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I want to give it to you?</font>

227
00:15:36,298 --> 00:15:39,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving it to you because you took care of Ah In the other day!</font>

228
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You are an incarnation of vengeance.</font>

229
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:42,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am.</font>

230
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:43,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me finish.</font>

231
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,268
<font color=#FFFF00>When you become as old as me,</font>

232
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>you learn to separate one thing from another.</font>

233
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I am really mad at you and I want to kill you,</font>

234
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have to thank you for what you've done for Ah In.</font>

235
00:15:57,668 --> 00:15:59,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if I'm really thankful to you,</font>

236
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:02,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to confront you about what you did to us.</font>

237
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:04,768
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not...</font>

238
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,698
<font color=#FFFF00>that I don't understand...</font>

239
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:09,598
<font color=#FFFF00>where you're coming from.</font>

240
00:16:10,128 --> 00:16:11,328
<font color=#FFFF00>To experience such tragedy...</font>

241
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:15,098
<font color=#FFFF00>must've been so horrifying.</font>

242
00:16:15,928 --> 00:16:18,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You were the eldest son to your father,</font>

243
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:21,728
<font color=#FFFF00>and you were the elder brother...</font>

244
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,468
<font color=#FFFF00>to your little brother.</font>

245
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:25,998
<font color=#FFFF00>But still,</font>

246
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,628
<font color=#FFFF00>you were just a sixth grader.</font>

247
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:32,628
<font color=#FFFF00>When you were supposed to be cared by your parents,</font>

248
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:34,828
<font color=#FFFF00>your father died,</font>

249
00:16:35,398 --> 00:16:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>and you lost your little brother.</font>

250
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:40,228
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am. - Be quiet, boy!</font>

251
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm telling you...</font>

252
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>that I am trying my best to understand you.</font>

253
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,568
<font color=#FFFF00>My children...</font>

254
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:59,128
<font color=#FFFF00>still can't understand you. They can't forgive you yet either.</font>

255
00:17:01,128 --> 00:17:02,168
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

256
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:05,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I sometimes...</font>

257
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>can understand you.</font>

258
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:11,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgive you for a while too.</font>

259
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,368
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

260
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:17,668
<font color=#FFFF00>you were too mean to us.</font>

261
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>My son...</font>

262
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,228
<font color=#FFFF00>raised Seong Joon with so much love.</font>

263
00:17:24,368 --> 00:17:26,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Regardless of what happened,</font>

264
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:29,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you should thank him.</font>

265
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Forget about everything that happened,</font>

266
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:36,568
<font color=#FFFF00>and just think about how well Seong Joon turned out.</font>

267
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Among the three brothers, he's the most successful one.</font>

268
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:42,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He's also the most handsome and the most mature one.</font>

269
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:45,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You should stop your vengeance now.</font>

270
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:47,398
<font color=#FFFF00>When I was packing these condiments,</font>

271
00:17:48,098 --> 00:17:49,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought about that.</font>

272
00:17:49,928 --> 00:17:51,998
<font color=#FFFF00>And it made me feel so sad.</font>

273
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:56,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if you will care about what I say,</font>

274
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,128
<font color=#FFFF00>but I've come here to tell you this...</font>

275
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,128
<font color=#FFFF00>as a grandmother.</font>

276
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going then.</font>

277
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't get to move...</font>

278
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,698
<font color=#FFFF00>the pots in the rooftop yet.</font>

279
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:15,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if Jeong Eun told you this.</font>

280
00:18:16,668 --> 00:18:19,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me leave them there until you tear down the house.</font>

281
00:18:20,498 --> 00:18:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a shame to waste them.</font>

282
00:18:23,628 --> 00:18:24,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do me a favor.</font>

283
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:27,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really leaving now.</font>

284
00:18:29,128 --> 00:18:30,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Ma'am.</font>

285
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,428
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't need to come out.</font>

286
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom,</font>

287
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:56,668
<font color=#FFFF00>now that we're eating ramyeon together in this small house,</font>

288
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like we've become Heung Bu's family.</font>

289
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:00,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like we're really poor.</font>

290
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:04,728
<font color=#FFFF00>But it's really cozy, so I don't hate it too much.</font>

291
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say cozy?</font>

292
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:09,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You're unbelievable.</font>

293
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:12,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, it splattered on my clothes.</font>

294
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:15,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm over 60 years old, and I'm eating ramyeon...</font>

295
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,498
<font color=#FFFF00>in this small house with my grown up children.</font>

296
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:18,868
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you call this cozy?</font>

297
00:19:18,868 --> 00:19:19,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

298
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:22,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying that's how it feels.</font>

299
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:25,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It would feel even better if it rains outside.</font>

300
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:28,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, since this already happened,</font>

301
00:19:28,598 --> 00:19:31,428
<font color=#FFFF00>we should live with a positive mind.</font>

302
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You can be positive all you want.</font>

303
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I can never be positive.</font>

304
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, it smells like ramyeon.</font>

305
00:19:38,998 --> 00:19:40,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been, Mother?</font>

306
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:41,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to the roof top.</font>

307
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you go there?</font>

308
00:19:45,198 --> 00:19:47,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I got some doenjang and gochujang.</font>

309
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,268
<font color=#FFFF00>And I fed Moong Chi since I already went there.</font>

310
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've asked the kids to do it.</font>

311
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you go there and drain your energy?</font>

312
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:56,098
<font color=#FFFF00>The real estate agent said they might tear it down soon.</font>

313
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,268
<font color=#FFFF00>We need to find...</font>

314
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:02,338
<font color=#FFFF00>a place to move her.</font>

315
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:03,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother,</font>

316
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:05,728
<font color=#FFFF00>eat some ramyeon.</font>

317
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

318
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,528
<font color=#FFFF00>We should be really thankful...</font>

319
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>that we can eat this ramyeon.</font>

320
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Only if...</font>

321
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon was smarter.</font>

322
00:20:21,528 --> 00:20:22,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

323
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:24,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about it, Mom.</font>

324
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:25,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon's brother,</font>

325
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee is very rich, you know?</font>

326
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,868
<font color=#FFFF00>If Seong Joon played smart,</font>

327
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,498
<font color=#FFFF00>we wouldn't be here doing this.</font>

328
00:20:32,628 --> 00:20:35,798
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so tactless and loyal.</font>

329
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:38,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He could go straight to his brother, make up with him,</font>

330
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:41,268
<font color=#FFFF00>and talk him into giving us our house back.</font>

331
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:43,728
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

332
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:46,968
<font color=#FFFF00>He could even get us a nicer house. How nice would that be?</font>

333
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,668
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey! - Goodness.</font>

334
00:20:49,668 --> 00:20:51,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to mention Mr. Lee in front of me, didn't I?</font>

335
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:54,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, it's just that I'm really sorry.</font>

336
00:20:54,998 --> 00:20:56,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You idiot.</font>

337
00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:58,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Is the one thing you managed to think about..</font>

338
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:01,068
<font color=#FFFF00>is exploiting his rich brother?</font>

339
00:21:01,068 --> 00:21:02,838
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not planning to exploit him.</font>

340
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,068
<font color=#FFFF00>That's a way of paying us back for everything we've done for him.</font>

341
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:08,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

342
00:21:08,928 --> 00:21:09,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet.</font>

343
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:11,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I do?</font>

344
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you have self-respect?</font>

345
00:21:13,728 --> 00:21:16,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't take it even if that guy will give us our house back.</font>

346
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll spit on his face right away.</font>

347
00:21:18,628 --> 00:21:21,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You've gone too far.</font>

348
00:21:21,768 --> 00:21:22,838
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

349
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:26,428
<font color=#FFFF00>If you think about it, Mr. Lee is a poor thing too.</font>

350
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:27,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

351
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:30,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of Hyung Seop's mistake, an innocent man died.</font>

352
00:21:30,168 --> 00:21:32,368
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Mr. Lee and Seong Joon...</font>

353
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:34,028
<font color=#FFFF00>became orphans overnight.</font>

354
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,898
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not all that happened.</font>

355
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:38,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee had to be parted with his only family...</font>

356
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon for 23 long years.</font>

357
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:46,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Think about you becoming orphans overnight.</font>

358
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, are you...</font>

359
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:51,568
<font color=#FFFF00>taking sides with Mr. Lee?</font>

360
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not taking any sides.</font>

361
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:56,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying this because he's nothing like our children.</font>

362
00:21:56,328 --> 00:21:58,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean he's nothing like us?</font>

363
00:21:58,528 --> 00:22:00,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at our children.</font>

364
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,898
<font color=#FFFF00>None of you wished to...</font>

365
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>leave your parents, and you all crawled back into the house...</font>

366
00:22:05,598 --> 00:22:06,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and created this mess.</font>

367
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee made his own fortune and came here...</font>

368
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:14,328
<font color=#FFFF00>with determination to find his brother.</font>

369
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:16,528
<font color=#FFFF00>It shows how hard he's been living his life.</font>

370
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,498
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nobody like him these days.</font>

371
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:21,098
<font color=#FFFF00>So what are you saying, Grandmother?</font>

372
00:22:21,128 --> 00:22:23,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you saying that guy's actions are justified?</font>

373
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,728
<font color=#FFFF00>That's wrong, Grandmother.</font>

374
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:29,028
<font color=#FFFF00>He shouldn't be doing this to us. We are innocent.</font>

375
00:22:29,268 --> 00:22:31,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just saying.</font>

376
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Just keep eating ramyeon. The noodles will get soft.</font>

377
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:34,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

378
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:38,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

379
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:42,028
<font color=#FFFF00>had to agree to play along.</font>

380
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I felt sorry to Chang Soo and you guys.</font>

381
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,968
<font color=#FFFF00>And I knew the family was going to become a mess.</font>

382
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>But I had to save the boy first.</font>

383
00:22:48,228 --> 00:22:50,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness, it's shocking.</font>

384
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,668
<font color=#FFFF00>How can the eighth grader think of jumping off a building?</font>

385
00:22:55,128 --> 00:22:57,968
<font color=#FFFF00>So I think from Dr. Kang's perspective,</font>

386
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:01,668
<font color=#FFFF00>he must have considered this to be quite a serious problem.</font>

387
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Dr. Kang...</font>

388
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:05,768
<font color=#FFFF00>knows how Hee Sook is.</font>

389
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:08,398
<font color=#FFFF00>He was well aware of Ji Hoon's condition.</font>

390
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:10,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about how serious it must have been for him...</font>

391
00:23:10,498 --> 00:23:12,368
<font color=#FFFF00>to use this sort of plan to save Ji Hoon.</font>

392
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, Dr. Kang's...</font>

393
00:23:16,498 --> 00:23:17,828
<font color=#FFFF00>youngest daughter...</font>

394
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,728
<font color=#FFFF00>went through something similar to what Ji Hoon went through.</font>

395
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:25,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard she is paralyzed from the waist down.</font>

396
00:23:27,498 --> 00:23:28,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

397
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

398
00:23:30,898 --> 00:23:32,068
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

399
00:23:32,068 --> 00:23:33,998
<font color=#FFFF00>he overreached...</font>

400
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:36,368
<font color=#FFFF00>so that the same thing doesn't happen to Ji Hoon.</font>

401
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,068
<font color=#FFFF00>He discussed that with me.</font>

402
00:23:39,498 --> 00:23:41,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Kids have to go through a lot these days.</font>

403
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,228
<font color=#FFFF00>If this continues, a disaster is bound to strike.</font>

404
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:46,298
<font color=#FFFF00>We ought to get rid of that college entrance exam.</font>

405
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>But still. Father,</font>

406
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:53,298
<font color=#FFFF00>we know the truth now.</font>

407
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:57,928
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not something we can cover up by ourselves.</font>

408
00:23:58,198 --> 00:24:00,268
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not an absolute solution.</font>

409
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:04,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, this is between Ji Hoon and Hee Sook.</font>

410
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:07,198
<font color=#FFFF00>We should tell Hee Sook the truth.</font>

411
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:10,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Let them find their own solution. Don't you think this is better?</font>

412
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:12,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

413
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Hee Sook will be thrilled to find the solution.</font>

414
00:24:15,168 --> 00:24:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know that with Chang Soo's success,</font>

415
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,768
<font color=#FFFF00>she is more confident about her education method than ever?</font>

416
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,568
<font color=#FFFF00>But still.</font>

417
00:24:21,568 --> 00:24:24,028
<font color=#FFFF00>When she finds out her son tried to kill himself...</font>

418
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:25,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What I saying is...</font>

419
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:28,568
<font color=#FFFF00>that people don't change. And that's the problem.</font>

420
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:31,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, look how she's been living her life recently.</font>

421
00:24:31,968 --> 00:24:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it was a lie,</font>

422
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:36,898
<font color=#FFFF00>but even though it was known that Ji Hoon wasn't her son,</font>

423
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:39,568
<font color=#FFFF00>she came downstairs to nag Ji Hoon.</font>

424
00:24:39,698 --> 00:24:40,768
<font color=#FFFF00>On top of that,</font>

425
00:24:40,868 --> 00:24:43,268
<font color=#FFFF00>she penetrated into the world of opera...</font>

426
00:24:43,428 --> 00:24:45,198
<font color=#FFFF00>and made Chang Soo win the competition.</font>

427
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:46,668
<font color=#FFFF00>She even took Ah In.</font>

428
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,228
<font color=#FFFF00>As of now, Ah In learned 1,800 Chinese characters.</font>

429
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:53,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she knows the most about the Chinese characters.</font>

430
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:55,428
<font color=#FFFF00>She's capable of this.</font>

431
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,198
<font color=#FFFF00>She will definitely find a solution with Ji Hoon.</font>

432
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:00,528
<font color=#FFFF00>On the day Hee Sook finds out the truth,</font>

433
00:25:01,298 --> 00:25:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>she will drag Ji Hoon away and it will be Ji Hoon's last day.</font>

434
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what do you suggest that we do?</font>

435
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:08,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you suggesting that we live as it is now?</font>

436
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:10,368
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all,</font>

437
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,628
<font color=#FFFF00>we will solve the problem with Seong Joon.</font>

438
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon and Jeong Hwa are still not speaking to each other.</font>

439
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:17,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

440
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:19,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

441
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it from Mr. Kim Han Gil.</font>

442
00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:27,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You know where Chairwoman Park Chang Wook is?</font>

443
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I do. I visited her.</font>

444
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:33,868
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this.</font>

445
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What world-shaking news.</font>

446
00:25:36,928 --> 00:25:38,468
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this continue for 20 years?</font>

447
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:41,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairman Bang deserves to die.</font>

448
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I knew it. Something was suspicious.</font>

449
00:25:47,768 --> 00:25:50,098
<font color=#FFFF00>However, there is a problem.</font>

450
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:54,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if the shareholders' did trust Chairwoman Park,</font>

451
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,568
<font color=#FFFF00>it'll be hard to win them over with just a rumor.</font>

452
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:01,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, at every shareholder meeting,</font>

453
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:02,928
<font color=#FFFF00>you were mentioned to be replaced.</font>

454
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:06,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone believes that you and Director Bang will get married.</font>

455
00:26:06,928 --> 00:26:09,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I am fully aware that the shareholders...</font>

456
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,228
<font color=#FFFF00>who support Chairwoman Park don't trust me.</font>

457
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:13,698
<font color=#FFFF00>However,</font>

458
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:17,268
<font color=#FFFF00>it is not true that Director Bang and I will get married.</font>

459
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:25,498
<font color=#FFFF00>There are a lot of people waiting for Chairwoman Park.</font>

460
00:26:25,768 --> 00:26:28,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't overlook the fact that it's been 20 years.</font>

461
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park was worried...</font>

462
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:34,198
<font color=#FFFF00>that 20 years has passed.</font>

463
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:36,028
<font color=#FFFF00>During that time,</font>

464
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,728
<font color=#FFFF00>some of us could have changed side.</font>

465
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,428
<font color=#FFFF00>If so, you will be in danger, Director Han.</font>

466
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you aware of this? - Yes, I am.</font>

467
00:26:45,768 --> 00:26:48,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What is the reason of your involvement despite the fact?</font>

468
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I just...</font>

469
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:52,468
<font color=#FFFF00>think that an injustice must be corrected.</font>

470
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:56,628
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

471
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:00,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have a definite plan?</font>

472
00:27:00,998 --> 00:27:01,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

473
00:27:03,198 --> 00:27:05,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Great. Then...</font>

474
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:08,268
<font color=#FFFF00>you must get Chairwoman Park out of his clutches.</font>

475
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:21,468
<font color=#FFFF00>(CEO Hwang of UN Production)</font>

476
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:32,098
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Han Seong Joon speaking.</font>

477
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:33,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Director Han.</font>

478
00:27:34,268 --> 00:27:36,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I was wondering if things were going well.</font>

479
00:27:36,628 --> 00:27:38,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just calling to check.</font>

480
00:27:40,028 --> 00:27:42,768
<font color=#FFFF00>- What is it? - It's nothing important.</font>

481
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you will be joining our production,</font>

482
00:27:46,628 --> 00:27:49,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I told a few agencies that you are joining our company.</font>

483
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:53,128
<font color=#FFFF00>We had an agreement that...</font>

484
00:27:53,198 --> 00:27:55,898
<font color=#FFFF00>you will keep my transfer a secret for a while.</font>

485
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:58,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to get things ready in advance too.</font>

486
00:27:59,698 --> 00:28:02,868
<font color=#FFFF00>When I told them you are planning to join our production,</font>

487
00:28:02,998 --> 00:28:06,868
<font color=#FFFF00>some agencies wanted to get involved in our projects.</font>

488
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why...</font>

489
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:12,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought that I should treat you better.</font>

490
00:28:12,968 --> 00:28:14,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

491
00:28:14,268 --> 00:28:15,668
<font color=#FFFF00>A while ago,</font>

492
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I just transferred some money to your account.</font>

493
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:19,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

494
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>It's for official expenses I planned on giving you once you start here.</font>

495
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of it as an advance.</font>

496
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Use it freely.</font>

497
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:28,828
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not necessary.</font>

498
00:28:29,228 --> 00:28:31,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I will send the money back to you right away.</font>

499
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:33,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

500
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:35,068
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are thankful,</font>

501
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:38,598
<font color=#FFFF00>it'd be great if you can start earlier than the set date.</font>

502
00:28:39,098 --> 00:28:40,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Hawng.</font>

503
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I will call you again later.</font>

504
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:53,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairman Bang.</font>

505
00:28:53,928 --> 00:28:54,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Seong Joon.</font>

506
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:57,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What is he up to these days?</font>

507
00:28:58,428 --> 00:28:59,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

508
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:02,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he meeting up with other directors?</font>

509
00:29:03,728 --> 00:29:05,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know how Seong Joon is?</font>

510
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:08,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He likes to prepare to the fullest.</font>

511
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>He told me that he wanted to help you properly.</font>

512
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,428
<font color=#FFFF00>He wanted to talk to other directors...</font>

513
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>who turned their back on him.</font>

514
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:17,268
<font color=#FFFF00>He's meeting them to test the water.</font>

515
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,328
<font color=#FFFF00>If that's what he's doing...</font>

516
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,828
<font color=#FFFF00>He should have done this a long time ago.</font>

517
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway I look at it, I don't like him.</font>

518
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:35,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. He's going to be different.</font>

519
00:29:35,268 --> 00:29:36,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Trust him, please?</font>

520
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:42,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

521
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:43,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you hear?</font>

522
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Over what are you making a fuss?</font>

523
00:29:47,598 --> 00:29:50,268
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? Are Director Han and Bang getting married...</font>

524
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:51,398
<font color=#FFFF00>or something?</font>

525
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:54,098
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What about Dong Hui?</font>

526
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Amazing. How did you know?</font>

527
00:29:57,268 --> 00:29:58,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - What?</font>

528
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>He's marrying her?</font>

529
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han and Bang are getting married?</font>

530
00:30:04,228 --> 00:30:06,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Then the reason why Chairman Bang dropped by last time...</font>

531
00:30:07,668 --> 00:30:09,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it really about their marriage?</font>

532
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:12,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Something is off. I really thought he liked Dong Hui.</font>

533
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:15,728
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

534
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:17,198
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - Hello.</font>

535
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop chatting...</font>

536
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:21,568
<font color=#FFFF00>and work, please. Okay?</font>

537
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:23,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - We will.</font>

538
00:30:29,668 --> 00:30:31,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is...</font>

539
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han trying to marry a woman like her?</font>

540
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Joon. - Hey.</font>

541
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:38,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here.</font>

542
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>How are your meetings with the directors going?</font>

543
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:44,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Surprisingly, some of them were quite friendly.</font>

544
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:48,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why? - Dad already knew about this.</font>

545
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:50,168
<font color=#FFFF00>He knew that you were meeting up with directors.</font>

546
00:30:50,928 --> 00:30:51,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

547
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,928
<font color=#FFFF00>That's probably why the news is getting around the company.</font>

548
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,698
<font color=#FFFF00>The news about our marriage.</font>

549
00:30:58,298 --> 00:30:59,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

550
00:30:59,428 --> 00:31:01,398
<font color=#FFFF00>the shareholder meeting will be held soon.</font>

551
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:04,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think people need to talk about it.</font>

552
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,198
<font color=#FFFF00>The shareholders might think...</font>

553
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:09,398
<font color=#FFFF00>that you are going around to get their approvals of our marriage.</font>

554
00:31:09,728 --> 00:31:11,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Which brings me to my question.</font>

555
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you can stop meeting the directors?</font>

556
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:20,928
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest, I don't think Dad likes you meeting them.</font>

557
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I will stop.</font>

558
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:27,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

559
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to have dinner tonight?</font>

560
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

561
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:33,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

562
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:34,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me just wrap things up.</font>

563
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,098
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

564
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm here to feed Moong Chi.</font>

565
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>- All right. - Okay.</font>

566
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Feed your dog then.</font>

567
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,068
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

568
00:32:06,068 --> 00:32:08,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you signed a contract with a company that has a bad reputation.</font>

569
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:16,598
<font color=#FFFF00>There's not a thing you are not informed of.</font>

570
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't like FGC,</font>

571
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:24,368
<font color=#FFFF00>but UN Production is worse than FGC.</font>

572
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:28,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You would have known that too.</font>

573
00:32:29,028 --> 00:32:31,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I do. I well aware of that.</font>

574
00:32:32,328 --> 00:32:33,328
<font color=#FFFF00>So?</font>

575
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:39,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you sell yourself to that nasty company...</font>

576
00:32:39,398 --> 00:32:41,028
<font color=#FFFF00>in order to help the people...</font>

577
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>whom you call your family rent a house?</font>

578
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this your method of cleaning things up?</font>

579
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are going to tell me the same thing, I don't want to hear it.</font>

580
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of that contract immediately.</font>

581
00:32:54,068 --> 00:32:56,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think they will take responsibility for your life?</font>

582
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:58,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You should assume responsibility for your own life.</font>

583
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:01,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm well aware of that too.</font>

584
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:04,368
<font color=#FFFF00>So please stop meddling in my life...</font>

585
00:33:04,898 --> 00:33:06,598
<font color=#FFFF00>and take responsibility for your own life.</font>

586
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:08,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Well then.</font>

587
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:21,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Here's your coffee.</font>

588
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:23,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Thank you. Enjoy it. - Thank you.</font>

589
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you look so surprised?</font>

590
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:30,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just your neighbor.</font>

591
00:33:35,298 --> 00:33:37,768
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you come? I didn't see you walking in.</font>

592
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I walked in while you're absorbed in making money.</font>

593
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Two coffees, please.</font>

594
00:33:46,498 --> 00:33:47,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?</font>

595
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:53,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

596
00:34:03,598 --> 00:34:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it? What are you doing here?</font>

597
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:09,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat.</font>

598
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,298
<font color=#FFFF00>And have some coffee.</font>

599
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,598
<font color=#FFFF00>So this is the routine.</font>

600
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:20,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you do me a favor?</font>

601
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:21,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What favor?</font>

602
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I look like a pushover?</font>

603
00:34:24,268 --> 00:34:25,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You know we broke up.</font>

604
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:29,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know what we call common courtesy between exes?</font>

605
00:34:29,238 --> 00:34:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so ridiculous.</font>

606
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:33,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Please stop Sang Woo.</font>

607
00:34:35,428 --> 00:34:36,898
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - He won't...</font>

608
00:34:37,398 --> 00:34:38,928
<font color=#FFFF00>listen to me no matter what I say.</font>

609
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not. Did you only notice that now?</font>

610
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:44,798
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't do what Seong Joon asked you either.</font>

611
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you do something you'd regret in the first place?</font>

612
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo sealed a move to UN Production...</font>

613
00:34:51,968 --> 00:34:54,468
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay the deposit for his family's house.</font>

614
00:34:55,598 --> 00:34:57,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

615
00:34:57,598 --> 00:35:00,828
<font color=#FFFF00>The problem is the company is quite nasty.</font>

616
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>He sealed a move knowing all that.</font>

617
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,738
<font color=#FFFF00>That idiot.</font>

618
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:08,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Then what is happening to Seong Joon?</font>

619
00:35:10,528 --> 00:35:12,668
<font color=#FFFF00>He will be abandoned after being used up.</font>

620
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:15,798
<font color=#FFFF00>It means his career will come to a dead end.</font>

621
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you should stop him.</font>

622
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I want you to stop him.</font>

623
00:35:21,528 --> 00:35:22,568
<font color=#FFFF00>He won't listen...</font>

624
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,398
<font color=#FFFF00>to whatever I say.</font>

625
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:28,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have played your role well as his brother.</font>

626
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:31,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Then he would have listened to you. Don't you think so?</font>

627
00:35:35,768 --> 00:35:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

628
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is very stubborn. There's no way I can stop him.</font>

629
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:47,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, please talk to him.</font>

630
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

631
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:53,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

632
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you for taking care of me that night.</font>

633
00:35:57,828 --> 00:35:58,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

634
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:08,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

635
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:10,628
<font color=#FFFF00>He knew the whole thing?</font>

636
00:36:11,598 --> 00:36:14,968
<font color=#FFFF00>He should have said thank you before he started talking.</font>

637
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:18,098
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so rude.</font>

638
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:23,568
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what should I do with Seong Joon?</font>

639
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:29,328
<font color=#FFFF00>When winter is gone</font>

640
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:33,498
<font color=#FFFF00>And spring comes</font>

641
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:39,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Spring will be gone again</font>

642
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:44,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

643
00:36:44,868 --> 00:36:46,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how you feel.</font>

644
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:48,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Beauty and hard life seldom go hand in hand.</font>

645
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You know...</font>

646
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:51,668
<font color=#FFFF00>a beautiful person like you...</font>

647
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,098
<font color=#FFFF00>is born under an unlucky star.</font>

648
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:57,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What can I say? You were just born beautiful.</font>

649
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:00,738
<font color=#FFFF00>You should blame your mother.</font>

650
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:03,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I supposed to do?</font>

651
00:37:03,628 --> 00:37:05,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that he's dying,</font>

652
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:07,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do anything.</font>

653
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:15,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only his fault...</font>

654
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:18,428
<font color=#FFFF00>that he was born...</font>

655
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:22,468
<font color=#FFFF00>with an ethereal voice.</font>

656
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:25,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Maybe it's time...</font>

657
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,098
<font color=#FFFF00>he should return...</font>

658
00:37:28,098 --> 00:37:30,528
<font color=#FFFF00>his voice to the sky.</font>

659
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:36,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this is happening.</font>

660
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:40,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I know great artists are...</font>

661
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:42,468
<font color=#FFFF00>born under an unlucky star,</font>

662
00:37:42,498 --> 00:37:45,598
<font color=#FFFF00>but this is just too much.</font>

663
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

664
00:37:55,498 --> 00:37:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>There isn't a lot of time left now.</font>

665
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:00,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so sad.</font>

666
00:38:03,328 --> 00:38:05,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true...</font>

667
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,368
<font color=#FFFF00>that he's given...</font>

668
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,998
<font color=#FFFF00>only three months to live?</font>

669
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:12,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

670
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:15,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Only three months.</font>

671
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Unfortunately,</font>

672
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,798
<font color=#FFFF00>he will live on April, May, and June.</font>

673
00:38:22,238 --> 00:38:23,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It's only May...</font>

674
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,468
<font color=#FFFF00>that has 31 days.</font>

675
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:28,498
<font color=#FFFF00>How devastating.</font>

676
00:38:33,368 --> 00:38:35,168
<font color=#FFFF00>He's such a jerk.</font>

677
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he come to me?</font>

678
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:40,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Does he want me to bury his body or what?</font>

679
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You should face your tragic fate.</font>

680
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How?</font>

681
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:49,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You should...</font>

682
00:38:50,398 --> 00:38:51,528
<font color=#FFFF00>live with him...</font>

683
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:53,368
<font color=#FFFF00>for the next three months.</font>

684
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Just before he dies.</font>

685
00:38:56,998 --> 00:38:57,998
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

686
00:39:00,998 --> 00:39:01,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's...</font>

687
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:04,968
<font color=#FFFF00>only three months.</font>

688
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:09,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

689
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:36,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you hate studying that much?</font>

690
00:39:37,268 --> 00:39:40,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Actually, I like studying. It is quite fun.</font>

691
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:42,668
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I get good grades.</font>

692
00:39:43,238 --> 00:39:44,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Then why did you try to kill yourself?</font>

693
00:39:46,368 --> 00:39:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I was scared out of my wits to hear that.</font>

694
00:39:50,238 --> 00:39:51,928
<font color=#FFFF00>When I get fully stressed out,</font>

695
00:39:52,198 --> 00:39:54,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like I want to die.</font>

696
00:39:54,428 --> 00:39:55,598
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why.</font>

697
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

698
00:39:59,198 --> 00:40:01,598
<font color=#FFFF00>if your mom finds out the whole thing...</font>

699
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:02,928
<font color=#FFFF00>It will kill me.</font>

700
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:03,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You!</font>

701
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop saying that.</font>

702
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not just about you.</font>

703
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:16,528
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact, I feel sorry for students these days.</font>

704
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:21,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Why aren't you eating it?</font>

705
00:40:22,698 --> 00:40:23,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no appetite.</font>

706
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:26,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought it for you. Just eat it.</font>

707
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:30,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You are supposed to like it at your age.</font>

708
00:40:32,468 --> 00:40:35,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, look at you.</font>

709
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:38,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish I could tell your mom...</font>

710
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:40,968
<font color=#FFFF00>that you're her son.</font>

711
00:40:40,968 --> 00:40:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It will really kill me.</font>

712
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:45,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! Stop talking about that.</font>

713
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you say that again? Will you?</font>

714
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

715
00:40:49,998 --> 00:40:51,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

716
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:54,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Eat it.</font>

717
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:56,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

718
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,238
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to tell you.</font>

719
00:41:05,628 --> 00:41:07,468
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about Seong Joon.</font>

720
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What about him?</font>

721
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:12,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Seong Joon sealed a move to another company.</font>

722
00:41:13,368 --> 00:41:15,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it a good thing?</font>

723
00:41:15,568 --> 00:41:18,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it that he was offered a better job?</font>

724
00:41:18,628 --> 00:41:22,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that's what usually happens, but this isn't the case.</font>

725
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:24,168
<font color=#FFFF00>The company who offered him a job...</font>

726
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:26,198
<font color=#FFFF00>has a bad reputation in the field.</font>

727
00:41:26,198 --> 00:41:27,828
<font color=#FFFF00>People say it is a nasty company.</font>

728
00:41:28,868 --> 00:41:30,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Then...</font>

729
00:41:30,398 --> 00:41:32,328
<font color=#FFFF00>why would Seong Joon move to the company then?</font>

730
00:41:32,598 --> 00:41:34,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems...</font>

731
00:41:34,298 --> 00:41:36,428
<font color=#FFFF00>he got a huge money for his transfer.</font>

732
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,068
<font color=#FFFF00>But he shouldn't do that.</font>

733
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You said it's a nasty company.</font>

734
00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:44,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Money is not an issue.</font>

735
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Did Seong Joon...</font>

736
00:41:46,528 --> 00:41:47,968
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

737
00:41:48,068 --> 00:41:51,168
<font color=#FFFF00>He made such a decision to get you the house.</font>

738
00:41:52,198 --> 00:41:53,468
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

739
00:41:53,768 --> 00:41:56,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he out of his mind? He can't do that.</font>

740
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:58,098
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about?</font>

741
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,898
<font color=#FFFF00>He's moving...</font>

742
00:41:59,928 --> 00:42:02,028
<font color=#FFFF00>to a nasty company just for the money?</font>

743
00:42:02,028 --> 00:42:03,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

744
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:04,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

745
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:08,128
<font color=#FFFF00>you should stop Seong Joon no matter what.</font>

746
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>If things go wrong,</font>

747
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:12,468
<font color=#FFFF00>his career will come to a dead end.</font>

752
00:43:54,328 --> 00:43:55,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that?</font>

753
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:45,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are...</font>

754
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,228

<font color=#FFFF00>(Death certificate, Oh Dong Hui)</font>

756
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:04,998
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

757
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:07,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is Dong Hui...</font>

758
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:10,268
<font color=#FFFF00>(Death certificate, Oh Dong Hui)</font>

759
00:45:19,498 --> 00:45:22,028
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just like what you saw. Dong Hui is...</font>

760
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon's granddaughter.</font>

761
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,668
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

762
00:45:27,298 --> 00:45:28,798
<font color=#FFFF00>she died a long time ago.</font>

763
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,028
<font color=#FFFF00>- Then... - Yes.</font>

764
00:45:32,528 --> 00:45:35,198
<font color=#FFFF00>The person who's living as Oh Dong Hui is...</font>

765
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:36,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park's granddaughter.</font>

766
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:40,028
<font color=#FFFF00>She's Late Bang Gwang Ho's only daughter,</font>

767
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:42,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Hyun Jeong.</font>

768
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:46,798
<font color=#FFFF00>How...</font>

769
00:45:48,028 --> 00:45:49,798
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this happen?</font>

770
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:52,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't tell you until now...</font>

771
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:55,428
<font color=#FFFF00>because Ms. Oh asked me not to tell you.</font>

772
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:58,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

773
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:00,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

774
00:46:01,398 --> 00:46:03,098
<font color=#FFFF00>isn't Dong Hui in a great danger?</font>

775
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:06,298
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no way they'd leave her alone.</font>

776
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:09,628
<font color=#FFFF00>But to extricate the chairwoman according to our plan,</font>

777
00:46:09,828 --> 00:46:11,328
<font color=#FFFF00>this is the only way.</font>

778
00:46:12,168 --> 00:46:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>So please send those files...</font>

779
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:15,428
<font color=#FFFF00>to Bang Gwang Jin as soon as possible.</font>

780
00:46:19,628 --> 00:46:20,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What will happen...</font>

781
00:46:22,328 --> 00:46:23,898
<font color=#FFFF00>to Dong Hui after I send them?</font>

782
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:28,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't give you a definite answer.</font>

783
00:46:29,898 --> 00:46:31,198
<font color=#FFFF00>However, this is...</font>

784
00:46:31,398 --> 00:46:34,098
<font color=#FFFF00>the only way for us.</font>

785
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:44,528
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

786
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:47,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

787
00:46:56,298 --> 00:46:59,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, how are you not well?</font>

788
00:47:00,668 --> 00:47:01,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

789
00:47:03,298 --> 00:47:06,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I just don't have energy. That's all.</font>

790
00:47:08,468 --> 00:47:10,528
<font color=#FFFF00>But your temperature is too high.</font>

791
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't stay like this.</font>

792
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,168
<font color=#FFFF00>We have to go to the clinic.</font>

793
00:47:16,698 --> 00:47:19,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Gui Boon asked me to deliver these documents.</font>

794
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:22,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

795
00:47:22,728 --> 00:47:24,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you Mr. Bang Gwang Jin?</font>

796
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:26,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right.</font>

799
00:47:42,168 --> 00:47:44,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. This is how it's supposed to be done.</font>

800
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:47,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Finally, everything is coming to an end.</font>

801
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:53,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything is over now.</font>

802
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:55,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what this is?</font>

803
00:47:58,568 --> 00:47:59,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

804
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,098
<font color=#FFFF00>This is...</font>

805
00:48:08,128 --> 00:48:09,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

806
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:11,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to take Grandmother to a hospital.</font>

807
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:14,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

808
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother isn't well.</font>

809
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Please let me take her to the hospital.</font>

810
00:48:19,128 --> 00:48:20,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to wait, didn't I?</font>

811
00:48:21,028 --> 00:48:23,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Until when? I beg you.</font>

812
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:25,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't run away.</font>

813
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:29,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Just let me take Grandmother to the hospital.</font>

814
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:32,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What if she passes away like this?</font>

815
00:48:33,098 --> 00:48:34,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you...</font>

816
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:36,828
<font color=#FFFF00>worried that your grandmother might pass away?</font>

817
00:48:38,528 --> 00:48:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk.</font>

818
00:48:40,528 --> 00:48:42,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey! How dare you talk to an elder that way?</font>

819
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:44,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You are terrible. You're terrible.</font>

820
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:46,428
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to us?</font>

821
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,728
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to my grandmother?</font>

822
00:48:49,268 --> 00:48:51,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me. Let go!</font>

823
00:48:52,568 --> 00:48:53,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop.</font>

824
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,528
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to save your grandmother, don't you?</font>

825
00:49:01,528 --> 00:49:04,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to save both of your grandmothers.</font>

826
00:49:04,828 --> 00:49:06,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to save them all, don't you?</font>

827
00:49:07,828 --> 00:49:11,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Then you better listen to me carefully.</font>

828
00:49:12,428 --> 00:49:14,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, what are you trying to do?</font>

829
00:49:15,398 --> 00:49:16,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

830
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:21,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me. My grandmother is sick!</font>

831
00:49:21,728 --> 00:49:24,498

<font color=#FFFF00>The old sayings are true.</font>

835
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:39,798
<font color=#FFFF00>There are no parents in this world...</font>

836
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:42,998
<font color=#FFFF00>who wouldn't do anything for their child.</font>

837
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:46,028
<font color=#FFFF00>It was going to turn out like this anyway.</font>

838
00:49:46,398 --> 00:49:48,268
<font color=#FFFF00>So if you fixed it earlier,</font>

839
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jeong didn't have to struggle.</font>

840
00:49:51,568 --> 00:49:54,528
<font color=#FFFF00>She could've lived a happy life.</font>

841
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, it's about time.</font>

842
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:03,528
<font color=#FFFF00>This is the will the bank has been keeping for you.</font>

843
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:07,628
<font color=#FFFF00>And this is Hyun Jeong's stock certificate.</font>

844
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:09,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Gui Boon gave up as well.</font>

845
00:50:10,468 --> 00:50:11,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, you just have...</font>

846
00:50:13,568 --> 00:50:15,928
<font color=#FFFF00>to fix your will.</font>

847
00:50:16,498 --> 00:50:18,098
<font color=#FFFF00>In my whole life,</font>

848
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:22,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I began as a street vendor...</font>

849
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:24,368
<font color=#FFFF00>and managed to save that much money.</font>

850
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:29,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I just wanted to feed, dress,</font>

851
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:32,828
<font color=#FFFF00>and educate my children well.</font>

852
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:36,528
<font color=#FFFF00>But that money became my enemy.</font>

853
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,668
<font color=#FFFF00>That money pulled siblings apart,</font>

854
00:50:39,928 --> 00:50:40,968
<font color=#FFFF00>and that money...</font>

855
00:50:41,398 --> 00:50:44,128
<font color=#FFFF00>also pulled apart the parent from her children.</font>

856
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:57,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Come closer.</font>

857
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:01,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

858
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

859
00:51:05,898 --> 00:51:07,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You grew up as a beautiful lady.</font>

860
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:12,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You became a beautiful lady.</font>

861
00:51:13,798 --> 00:51:15,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

862
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:18,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

863
00:51:19,128 --> 00:51:21,768
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing you should be sorry about.</font>

864
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:24,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I am the one...</font>

865
00:51:25,898 --> 00:51:28,098
<font color=#FFFF00>who is sorry.</font>

866
00:51:29,898 --> 00:51:31,898
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandmother. - Yes?</font>

867
00:51:33,328 --> 00:51:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Just...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>fix the will for him.</font>

869
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:40,828
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

870
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:43,928
<font color=#FFFF00>But you...</font>

871
00:51:46,168 --> 00:51:49,098
<font color=#FFFF00>won't be taking anything then.</font>

872
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need anything.</font>

873
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been living that way until now.</font>

874
00:51:56,328 --> 00:51:57,598
<font color=#FFFF00>So Grandmother,</font>

875
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,728
<font color=#FFFF00>don't worry about me...</font>

876
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>and just...</font>

877
00:52:02,098 --> 00:52:03,668
<font color=#FFFF00>fix the will.</font>

878
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:06,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been stuck here...</font>

879
00:52:07,028 --> 00:52:08,868
<font color=#FFFF00>for the past 20 years.</font>

880
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:12,328
<font color=#FFFF00>You spent too many years in here.</font>

881
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:14,028
<font color=#FFFF00>My darling.</font>

882
00:52:15,328 --> 00:52:16,728

<font color=#FFFF00>My lovely darling.</font>

885
00:52:22,568 --> 00:52:24,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me hug you.</font>

887
00:52:28,068 --> 00:52:29,328

892
00:52:47,868 --> 00:52:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay!</font>

893
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:53,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I waited for 20 years. 20 years, I tell you.</font>

894
00:52:55,028 --> 00:52:57,468
<font color=#FFFF00>It has turned my hair gray.</font>

895
00:52:59,628 --> 00:53:00,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I have one condition.</font>

896
00:53:01,628 --> 00:53:03,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I want you...</font>

897
00:53:04,028 --> 00:53:05,698

899

<font color=#FFFF00>- Mr. Kim. - Yes, sir.</font>

900
00:53:11,598 --> 00:53:13,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- Take care of this. - Yes, sir.</font>

901
00:53:16,968 --> 00:53:20,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to release them anyway.</font>

902
00:53:21,028 --> 00:53:23,628
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't have a penny to their names.</font>

903
00:53:24,398 --> 00:53:25,698
<font color=#FFFF00>She will live...</font>

904
00:53:26,168 --> 00:53:28,728
<font color=#FFFF00>as Oh Dong Hui for the rest of her life.</font>

905
00:53:28,728 --> 00:53:29,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so?</font>

906
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:38,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, my dear Ye Bin. You're studying English.</font>

907
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:41,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I don't want to study English.</font>

908
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:46,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to. You know Chang Soo came first place in his competition.</font>

909
00:53:46,368 --> 00:53:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Children are supposed to study.</font>

910
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:53,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to go out and play.</font>

911
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:54,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't!</font>

912
00:53:55,628 --> 00:53:57,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ji Hoon, stop right there. - No.</font>

913
00:53:57,498 --> 00:53:59,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to stop.</font>

914
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:00,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing, Hee Sook?</font>

915
00:54:01,068 --> 00:54:02,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

916
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this your report card?</font>

917
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:08,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are your grades so terrible?</font>

918
00:54:10,328 --> 00:54:11,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you closing your ears?</font>

919
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop closing your ears!</font>

920
00:54:15,868 --> 00:54:17,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

921
00:54:17,228 --> 00:54:19,728
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's the matter? - Hee Sook.</font>

922
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:21,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

923
00:54:21,668 --> 00:54:22,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

924
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:26,498
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

925
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:28,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It's no big deal.</font>

926
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:31,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I was talking to Ji Hoon.</font>

927
00:54:31,928 --> 00:54:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Ji Hoon, follow me.</font>

928
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:34,728
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

929
00:54:34,798 --> 00:54:36,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not talking to you.</font>

930
00:54:38,668 --> 00:54:40,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Please excuse him.</font>

931
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:44,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon must have been stressed out with studying.</font>

932
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:45,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me.</font>

933
00:54:46,228 --> 00:54:48,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- I said no! - Gosh.</font>

934
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:49,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey!</font>

935
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:53,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you are doing to your Mom?</font>

936
00:54:54,198 --> 00:54:55,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean,</font>

937
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:57,868
<font color=#FFFF00>she's your aunt.</font>

938
00:55:02,228 --> 00:55:05,298
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be under a lot of stress.</font>

939
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:09,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You should stop it. Ji Hoon is not your son.</font>

940
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:11,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to Hye Joo's son?</font>

941
00:55:11,668 --> 00:55:13,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I just can't understand you.</font>

942
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. You know that.</font>

943
00:55:16,028 --> 00:55:17,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon and Hye Joo are...</font>

944
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:20,398
<font color=#FFFF00>not that interested in their child's education.</font>

945
00:55:20,628 --> 00:55:23,228
<font color=#FFFF00>If Ji Hoon studies a little harder,</font>

946
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:25,368
<font color=#FFFF00>he will get first place in his school again.</font>

947
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,628
<font color=#FFFF00>He will even take the nation's first place.</font>

948
00:55:28,098 --> 00:55:30,198
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ji Hoon, follow me. - No.</font>

949
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:32,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, stop it.</font>

950
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:35,428
<font color=#FFFF00>You can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink.</font>

951
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:38,668
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no way you can force him to study when he doesn't want to.</font>

952
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:41,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe this. Honey.</font>

953
00:55:41,598 --> 00:55:43,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just focus on Chang Soo.</font>

954
00:55:43,998 --> 00:55:46,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon is not our son anymore. Why are you doing this?</font>

955
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:49,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Just give him to Seong Hoon and forget about him.</font>

956
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:52,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, Mother, and Father.</font>

957
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:54,468
<font color=#FFFF00>And members of this family.</font>

958
00:55:55,928 --> 00:55:57,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I raised him for 15 years.</font>

959
00:55:58,198 --> 00:55:59,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though...</font>

960
00:55:59,698 --> 00:56:01,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't give birth to him,</font>

961
00:56:02,168 --> 00:56:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I raised him with all my heart for 15 years.</font>

962
00:56:05,728 --> 00:56:08,928
<font color=#FFFF00>We are living under the same roof after all.</font>

963
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:12,528
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't matter whether he's my birth son or not.</font>

964
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's just make the most of our special abilities. You make money.</font>

965
00:56:16,728 --> 00:56:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>And I will be in charge of children's education.</font>

966
00:56:19,828 --> 00:56:22,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with that?</font>

967
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:26,168
<font color=#FFFF00>The problem is Ji Hoon doesn't want it.</font>

968
00:56:26,498 --> 00:56:29,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, take Ji Hoon with you.</font>

969
00:56:29,968 --> 00:56:31,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Bring him.</font>

970
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:34,498
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't go. Follow me.</font>

971
00:56:34,498 --> 00:56:37,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, let go of him.</font>

972
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:39,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You should let go of him.</font>

973
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:41,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon needs to study.</font>

974
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:45,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you are doing with him?</font>

975
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:47,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

976
00:56:48,168 --> 00:56:49,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Follow me!</font>

977
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Kang Hee Sook!</font>

978
00:56:51,568 --> 00:56:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You wicked wench!</font>

979
00:56:53,298 --> 00:56:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you want to see him die?</font>

980
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:56,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I said he needs to study.</font>

981
00:56:56,968 --> 00:56:59,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hee Sook, stop it. - Hee Sook.</font>

982
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you out of your mind?</font>

983
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:04,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it, everyone!</font>

984
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:08,098
<font color=#FFFF00>If you keep doing this, I'll run away from home.</font>

985
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:12,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Ji Hoon!</font>

986
00:57:12,628 --> 00:57:15,228
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ji Hoon, you rascal! - Hee Sook!</font>

987
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:17,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to stop!</font>

988
00:57:23,228 --> 00:57:24,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you see that?</font>

989
00:57:26,528 --> 00:57:27,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes. - Yes.</font>

990
00:57:27,798 --> 00:57:29,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I did.</font>

991
00:57:29,628 --> 00:57:31,098
<font color=#FFFF00>It's that bad.</font>

992
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think...</font>

993
00:57:33,568 --> 00:57:36,698
<font color=#FFFF00>it is a good idea to tell her the truth now.</font>

994
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:40,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. That's exactly what I'm saying.</font>

995
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:44,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

996
00:57:46,968 --> 00:57:48,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Still.</font>

997
00:57:49,228 --> 00:57:53,128
<font color=#FFFF00>How long do we have to do this?</font>

998
00:57:54,168 --> 00:57:56,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's say we will let it slide this time.</font>

999
00:57:56,798 --> 00:57:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>But after quite a while,</font>

1000
00:57:58,968 --> 00:58:00,928
<font color=#FFFF00>how will you tell them the truth?</font>

1001
00:58:01,628 --> 00:58:03,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

1002
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:06,328
<font color=#FFFF00>This is driving me crazy. What should we do?</font>

1003
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:13,898
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't me.</font>

1004
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it you, Dad?</font>

1005
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:21,928
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't me.</font>

1006
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Who would it be then?</font>

1007
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:32,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

1008
00:58:34,968 --> 00:58:38,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, since when were you there?</font>

1009
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:39,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

1010
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, what did you hear?</font>

1011
00:58:43,268 --> 00:58:44,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that true?</font>

1012
00:58:44,998 --> 00:58:46,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - What?</font>

1013
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:51,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that Ji Hoon and I weren't switched?</font>

1014
00:58:54,668 --> 00:58:56,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What should we do?</font>

1015
00:58:57,198 --> 00:58:59,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Was it really a lie?</font>

1016
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:01,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that it?</font>

1017
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:04,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. Mom.</font>

1018
00:59:04,498 --> 00:59:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandfather.</font>

1019
00:59:05,698 --> 00:59:07,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Keep quiet.</font>

1020
00:59:07,268 --> 00:59:08,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to him?</font>

1021
00:59:08,998 --> 00:59:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay quiet.</font>

1022
00:59:10,928 --> 00:59:12,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it really true?</font>

1023
00:59:12,468 --> 00:59:14,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it true that we were not switched?</font>

1024
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to be quiet.</font>

1025
00:59:16,498 --> 00:59:18,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon, stop covering his mouth with your hand.</font>

1026
00:59:18,728 --> 00:59:20,868
<font color=#FFFF00>- Keep quiet. - Stop it.</font>

1027
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:30,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, are you okay?</font>

1028
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I'm fine.</font>

1029
00:59:34,228 --> 00:59:38,098
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, go give Seong Joon a call.</font>

1030
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:41,098
<font color=#FFFF00>He's taking care of everything all alone.</font>

1031
00:59:42,098 --> 00:59:44,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid if he'd be in danger.</font>

1032
00:59:44,698 --> 00:59:47,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Go give him a call now.</font>

1033
00:59:50,468 --> 00:59:51,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

1034
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, it's me.</font>

1035
01:00:02,628 --> 01:00:03,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, we are out.</font>

1036
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:06,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother and I got out of the house.</font>

1037
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi.</font>

1038
01:00:20,998 --> 01:00:22,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi.</font>

1039
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here alone?</font>

1040
01:00:26,628 --> 01:00:29,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, I missed you so much.</font>

1041
01:00:30,528 --> 01:00:32,068
<font color=#FFFF00>My dear Moong Chi.</font>

1042
01:00:33,298 --> 01:00:34,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1043
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon really did that?</font>

1044
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:37,728
<font color=#FFFF00>That's ridiculous.</font>

1045
01:00:38,128 --> 01:00:40,368
<font color=#FFFF00>He wouldn't do that. There must have been a mix-up.</font>

1046
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of this, Mi Joo.</font>

1047
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:45,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say...</font>
