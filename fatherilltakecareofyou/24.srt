2
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:26,574
<font color="yellow">We had such a hard time finding him.</font>

3
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:29,604
<font color="yellow">Is he the child?</font>

4
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,204
<font color="yellow">Yes, he is.</font>

5
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:55,004
<font color="yellow">It's my brother, Sang Woo.</font>

6
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:56,634
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

7
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:58,934
<font color="yellow">I'm glad that he's the one.</font>

8
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:03,474
<font color="yellow">He was sent to a nearby orphanage
according to the record.</font>

9
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:07,804
<font color="yellow">A man who went fishing found him first.</font>

10
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:24,274
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo.</font>

11
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:33,234
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

12
00:01:36,074 --> 00:01:37,704
<font color="yellow">Did you call me?</font>

13
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:40,274
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

14
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,214
<font color="yellow">What is your reason behind
your actions towards me?</font>

15
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:54,474
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

16
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:56,374
<font color="yellow">What are you doing over there?</font>

17
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:58,204
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, Father.</font>

18
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:10,234
<font color="yellow">What were you doing?</font>

19
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,334
<font color="yellow">Were you talking to someone?</font>

20
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:14,974
<font color="yellow">No, I wasn't. Father.</font>

21
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,603
<font color="yellow">- Are you throwing out the trash?
- Yes.</font>

22
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:18,634
<font color="yellow">Let me.</font>

23
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,474
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's cold.</font>

24
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:23,834
<font color="yellow">Let's go in, Father.</font>

25
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:16,704
<font color="yellow">President.</font>

26
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:18,674
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

27
00:03:18,804 --> 00:03:19,804
<font color="yellow">President.</font>

28
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:24,204
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

29
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,474
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

30
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:41,374
<font color="yellow">Your effort of 23 years has
brought you a fruitful result.</font>

31
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:48,174
<font color="yellow">I am not so certain.</font>

32
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:53,074
<font color="yellow">I am not certain if this
is something to celebrate.</font>

33
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:55,534
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

34
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:57,604
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo...</font>

35
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,234
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo is with that family.</font>

36
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:04,404
<font color="yellow">I have to bring the family to its ruins.</font>

37
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:08,434
<font color="yellow">Would you like to revise your plan?</font>

38
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,074
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

39
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,834
<font color="yellow">I won't.</font>

40
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:15,404
<font color="yellow">No, I will never revise it.</font>

41
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:18,974
<font color="yellow">That man destroyed our family.</font>

42
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:21,134
<font color="yellow">He drove my father to death.</font>

43
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:24,704
<font color="yellow">He caused me to be separated
from my brother for 23 years.</font>

44
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,104
<font color="yellow">Just because he raised Sang Woo,</font>

45
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:32,274
<font color="yellow">should I forgive that man?</font>

46
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:33,704
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

47
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:37,344
<font color="yellow">you might harm Sang Woo. Not just
harm, but you might destroy him.</font>

48
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,674
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it's possible?</font>

49
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,774
<font color="yellow">Imagine he discovers that the
father, who has raised him...</font>

50
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:46,844
<font color="yellow">for 23 years, drove his
biological father into his death.</font>

51
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:51,374
<font color="yellow">How will Sang Woo cope with that pain?</font>

52
00:04:57,474 --> 00:04:59,604
<font color="yellow">That was the despair I felt tonight.</font>

53
00:05:00,774 --> 00:05:03,374
<font color="yellow">I couldn't even hug my
brother even if I found him.</font>

54
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,974
<font color="yellow">I couldn't tell him that I was his brother.</font>

55
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,474
<font color="yellow">He still has my brother.</font>

56
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:16,074
<font color="yellow">To him, I am just a
strange and pathetic man.</font>

57
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:22,304
<font color="yellow">I don't know how to approach him...</font>

58
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:26,974
<font color="yellow">and how to resolve this matter.</font>

59
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,534
<font color="yellow">I am clueless.</font>

60
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:35,804
<font color="yellow">Just think about one thing tonight.</font>

61
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:38,874
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo grew up as a fine individual.</font>

62
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,034
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

63
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:49,474
<font color="yellow">Yes, I think so.</font>

64
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,104
<font color="yellow">He did indeed.</font>

65
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:55,274
<font color="yellow">President.</font>

66
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,174
<font color="yellow">Just think about that for tonight.</font>

67
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:11,704
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, let's eat.</font>

68
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,534
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui already fed you breakfast.</font>

69
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:19,804
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

70
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:22,274
<font color="yellow">Should we go to work?</font>

71
00:06:22,734 --> 00:06:25,134
<font color="yellow">No, I will go by myself.</font>

72
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:26,734
<font color="yellow">I will see you at work later.</font>

73
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,334
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

74
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:47,274
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo.</font>

75
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,634
<font color="yellow">Did you call me?</font>

76
00:06:50,674 --> 00:06:51,674
<font color="yellow">I think so.</font>

77
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:07,804
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh Dong Hui.</font>

78
00:07:08,904 --> 00:07:11,904
<font color="yellow">- Yes?
- Can you give me a cup of coffee?</font>

79
00:07:23,304 --> 00:07:24,334
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

80
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,734
<font color="yellow">Why do you treat me like this?</font>

81
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,274
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

82
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:43,774
<font color="yellow">You know in a drama,</font>

83
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:46,334
<font color="yellow">a woman is angry at a man.</font>

84
00:07:46,374 --> 00:07:48,004
<font color="yellow">She doesn't tell him why she's angry.</font>

85
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,704
<font color="yellow">When the guy asks her why she's mad,</font>

86
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,535
<font color="yellow">instead of answering, she asks him
if he doesn't know and gets angry.</font>

87
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:58,604
<font color="yellow">How can that guy know if
she wouldn't tell him?</font>

88
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:02,134
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me that?</font>

89
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:06,104
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, aren't you angry at me?</font>

90
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:09,634
<font color="yellow">You seem angry, but you wouldn't tell me.</font>

91
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:13,634
<font color="yellow">You're pushing me away again.
Aren't I correct?</font>

92
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,804
<font color="yellow">- No, you are wrong.
- Am I wrong?</font>

93
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,134
<font color="yellow">Yes, you are wrong.</font>

94
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,474
<font color="yellow">Then, why are you so distant?</font>

95
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,374
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

96
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,714
<font color="yellow">You said not to visit you in the workroom.</font>

97
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:28,374
<font color="yellow">I asked you to go to work together,
but you ran away. Even now,</font>

98
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,504
<font color="yellow">you were about to leave like a stray
cat after you served me coffee.</font>

99
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:36,374
<font color="yellow">So I am certain that you are mad at me.
Are you telling me you're not?</font>

100
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:42,634
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Don't pick a fight in the morning.</font>

101
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:44,374
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

102
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:50,134
<font color="yellow">If everyone's here, let's
start the meeting.</font>

103
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,944
<font color="yellow">- Where's Director Han?
- He came in a while ago.</font>

104
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,034
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

105
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:00,834
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

106
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,034
<font color="yellow">Hello, Director. I'll get going now.</font>

107
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,204
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

108
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:23,274
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing today?
- I'm visiting the branches.</font>

109
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,834
<font color="yellow">Okay. Work hard.</font>

110
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:35,474
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong. Pull down the blind.</font>

111
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,234
<font color="yellow">The meeting with the
shareholders is next Monday.</font>

112
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,074
<font color="yellow">I reckon in that meeting,</font>

113
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:52,074
<font color="yellow">they'll discuss whether to maintain
Contents Department or not.</font>

114
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,103
<font color="yellow">Before that, we must find
Writer Jo's replacement.</font>

115
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:58,904
<font color="yellow">Not to lose our airing time, we must
submit a groundbreaking synopsis.</font>

116
00:10:00,204 --> 00:10:03,834
<font color="yellow">Did you pick three synopses
you'd like to recommend?</font>

117
00:10:03,974 --> 00:10:05,004
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

118
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,694
<font color="yellow">Can you give your recommendations
first, Director Han?</font>

119
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,704
<font color="yellow">I won't partake in this.</font>

120
00:10:11,274 --> 00:10:14,134
<font color="yellow">- Why is that?
- To make sure, it's chosen fairly.</font>

121
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:17,534
<font color="yellow">I know the titles and the
names of the writers.</font>

122
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,834
<font color="yellow">Okay. Why don't we start with
you first, Mr. Park Jin Sang?</font>

123
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:22,974
<font color="yellow">- Tell us your recommendations.
- Yes.</font>

124
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,704
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon went to work early.</font>

125
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:34,204
<font color="yellow">He said he was busy with work. He
didn't even get to have breakfast.</font>

126
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:38,234
<font color="yellow">Did he? I guess Dong Hui
went in early as well.</font>

127
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:44,033
<font color="yellow">I told you not to bring her up when
we are talking about Seong Joon.</font>

128
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,773
<font color="yellow">Why do you talk about them together?</font>

129
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:49,943
<font color="yellow">They work at the same company.</font>

130
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,773
<font color="yellow">Even if they work at the same
company, Seong Joon is a director...</font>

131
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:54,804
<font color="yellow">and she is just a mere employee.</font>

132
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:58,934
<font color="yellow">How can you put them in the same
group when you talk? You're his dad.</font>

133
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,774
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm devious like you?</font>

134
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,604
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean anything by it.</font>

135
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:08,974
<font color="yellow">Anyway, watch your tongue.
Whatever you say might come true.</font>

136
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:13,304
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Where are you going?</font>

137
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:18,304
<font color="yellow">I'm going downstairs. Seong
Hoon didn't go to work yet.</font>

138
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,324
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to give him
some beef bone broth.</font>

139
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,074
<font color="yellow">How about mine?</font>

140
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,474
<font color="yellow">There's none.</font>

141
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:29,834
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

142
00:11:33,534 --> 00:11:34,634
<font color="yellow">Goodness. My head hurts.</font>

143
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,174
<font color="yellow">Gosh, my head hurts so much.</font>

144
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:39,874
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

145
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,634
<font color="yellow">I think I drank too much
with the Senior Secretary.</font>

146
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,234
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

147
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,374
<font color="yellow">Honey. Get me some water.</font>

148
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,134
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

149
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:00,974
<font color="yellow">My head.</font>

150
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,334
<font color="yellow">I'm dying. Is it water with honey?</font>

151
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,074
<font color="yellow">Honey. Can you get me my clothes?</font>

152
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:21,534
<font color="yellow">I have to leave early, but
look at what I'm doing.</font>

153
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:25,574
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I have to stop by a sauna.</font>

154
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,704
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

155
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:37,604
<font color="yellow">It's me. What?</font>

156
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:39,434
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon?</font>

157
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:42,834
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

158
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:46,834
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like a wolf
in "Little Red Riding Hood"?</font>

159
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:51,934
<font color="yellow">What? A wolf in "Little Red Riding Hood"?</font>

160
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,374
<font color="yellow">Sure. I am a wolf, dressed
up as a lady. So what?</font>

161
00:12:56,734 --> 00:13:00,704
<font color="yellow">Get up. Do I need to give you water
with honey and your clothes?</font>

162
00:13:03,704 --> 00:13:04,974
<font color="yellow">Why are you flaring your nose?</font>

163
00:13:10,634 --> 00:13:11,674
<font color="yellow">Eat.</font>

164
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,234
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, what is this?</font>

165
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,934
<font color="yellow">Do you have to ask? It's leftover
fried chicken from yesterday.</font>

166
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:19,774
<font color="yellow">But still, Seong Hoon.</font>

167
00:13:20,074 --> 00:13:23,574
<font color="yellow">Who serves leftover fried chicken
from the day before as breakfast?</font>

168
00:13:23,774 --> 00:13:26,074
<font color="yellow">Hey. Be grateful that I'm feeding you.</font>

169
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,604
<font color="yellow">Our children went to school
without having breakfast.</font>

170
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:30,574
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, you can't serve this.</font>

171
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,474
<font color="yellow">This is ridiculous.</font>

172
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:33,654
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

173
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:35,034
<font color="yellow">Where is Hye Joo?</font>

174
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,234
<font color="yellow">Of course, she's at work now.</font>

175
00:13:37,374 --> 00:13:40,674
<font color="yellow">Then, what about my wife?</font>

176
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,674
<font color="yellow">How on earth would I know?</font>

177
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:48,134
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

178
00:13:49,574 --> 00:13:51,674
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Mom.
- You're here.</font>

179
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:54,134
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

180
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:55,304
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

181
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:57,133
<font color="yellow">Mom, actually...</font>

182
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:58,774
<font color="yellow">Mom, well...</font>

183
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:00,204
<font color="yellow">Oh, boy.</font>

184
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,334
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon!</font>

185
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:11,433
<font color="yellow">These are the survey papers
for the demonstration.</font>

186
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,374
<font color="yellow">Summarize them and make a report.</font>

187
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,073
<font color="yellow">What about the spa tickets?</font>

188
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,603
<font color="yellow">Find out what happened and
make a report about it.</font>

189
00:14:16,604 --> 00:14:17,774
<font color="yellow">I will.</font>

190
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:20,373
<font color="yellow">I got a lot of calls from your family...</font>

191
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:21,803
<font color="yellow">when you were in the showroom.</font>

192
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:24,034
<font color="yellow">I know, my phone kept ringing.</font>

193
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,504
<font color="yellow">You can leave.</font>

194
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,903
<font color="yellow">Hello, my dear mother.</font>

195
00:14:34,904 --> 00:14:36,334
<font color="yellow">How are you?</font>

196
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:38,473
<font color="yellow">Are you joking me?</font>

197
00:14:38,474 --> 00:14:40,533
<font color="yellow">Sorry? I am not.</font>

198
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,174
<font color="yellow">Why did you ignore my phone calls?</font>

199
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:43,934
<font color="yellow">I didn't, Mother.</font>

200
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,204
<font color="yellow">Don't try to fool me.</font>

201
00:14:45,674 --> 00:14:48,234
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I was working.</font>

202
00:14:48,534 --> 00:14:52,004
<font color="yellow">You don't need to explain. What
do you think you're doing?</font>

203
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,873
<font color="yellow">Pardon? What do you mean?</font>

204
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:56,934
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me. Just come see
what your husband is doing now!</font>

205
00:14:57,304 --> 00:15:01,173
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, please take this
apron and this scarf off.</font>

206
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,904
<font color="yellow">Wait. I'm didn't finish the housework yet.</font>

207
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,404
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

208
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:09,804
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to my son?</font>

209
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,434
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

210
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:15,234
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I was too busy this morning.</font>

211
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,734
<font color="yellow">Still, you can't make him wear
an apron and a scarf like that!</font>

212
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,734
<font color="yellow">- Come on.
- Stop it.</font>

213
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:23,503
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

214
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,934
<font color="yellow">guys also wear an apron.</font>

215
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:27,473
<font color="yellow">Mine is worn out,</font>

216
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:29,755
<font color="yellow">so I made him wear Hee Sook's
Doesn't he look good in it?</font>

217
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:31,434
<font color="yellow">He looks like a doll.</font>

218
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:33,874
<font color="yellow">What? A doll?</font>

219
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:39,134
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to mess with me?</font>

220
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:41,833
<font color="yellow">You're living in the same
house with me, his mother.</font>

221
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:46,174
<font color="yellow">How can you do such a
barbaric thing to my son?</font>

222
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:47,674
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

223
00:15:48,074 --> 00:15:49,373
<font color="yellow">A barbaric thing?</font>

224
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,733
<font color="yellow">I've never made him do housework...</font>

225
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,074
<font color="yellow">while raising him.</font>

226
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,473
<font color="yellow">That's why he's grown into...</font>

227
00:15:57,474 --> 00:15:59,804
<font color="yellow">a mother's boy.</font>

228
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:02,674
<font color="yellow">A mother's boy? Did you just say that?</font>

229
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,134
<font color="yellow">Say that again.</font>

230
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:05,334
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

231
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:08,174
<font color="yellow">Actually, Hee Sook...</font>

232
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,434
<font color="yellow">Speaking of Hee Sook, where is she now?</font>

233
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,433
<font color="yellow">What is she up to these days?</font>

234
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,003
<font color="yellow">The house is chaotic.</font>

235
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:18,803
<font color="yellow">Right, Mom. Ask her where my wife is.</font>

236
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,433
<font color="yellow">Stay out of it.</font>

237
00:16:20,434 --> 00:16:23,734
<font color="yellow">Just take these off now!</font>

238
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:24,874
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

239
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,174
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook is extremely busy these days.</font>

240
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,934
<font color="yellow">Why? Why is she that busy?</font>

241
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:33,734
<font color="yellow">Let's say...</font>

242
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:37,334
<font color="yellow">she's regained the joy of life.</font>

243
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,034
<font color="yellow">Please do not stop her.</font>

244
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:41,404
<font color="yellow">Please don't look for her.</font>

245
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,134
<font color="yellow">It won't be easy.</font>

246
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,734
<font color="yellow">What on earth are you talking about?</font>

247
00:16:48,134 --> 00:16:50,504
<font color="yellow">This sikhye is too sweet.</font>

248
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:52,733
<font color="yellow">- Let's drink iced coffee.
- Okay.</font>

249
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:54,234
<font color="yellow">- I'll go get it.
- Sure.</font>

250
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,634
<font color="yellow">It's all right. Please go sit down.</font>

251
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:02,774
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

252
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,334
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

253
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,234
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

254
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:08,804
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

255
00:17:08,934 --> 00:17:11,474
<font color="yellow">I bought a lot. Why don't
you share with me?</font>

256
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:15,234
<font color="yellow">I saw the news that the egg price soared.</font>

257
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,874
<font color="yellow">And it really did.</font>

258
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,474
<font color="yellow">Please have an egg.</font>

259
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:25,334
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

260
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,273
<font color="yellow">And this is the iced coffee...</font>

261
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:31,334
<font color="yellow">you've wanted to have badly.</font>

262
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:36,203
<font color="yellow">By the way, who are you?</font>

263
00:17:36,204 --> 00:17:37,274
<font color="yellow">Aren't you...</font>

264
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,933
<font color="yellow">mothers of the 10th-grade
students who study vocal music...</font>

265
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,734
<font color="yellow">in Seoul Munhwa Art High School?</font>

266
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,874
<font color="yellow">My son also studies vocal music.</font>

267
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,334
<font color="yellow">Your son is In Seok,</font>

268
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:52,534
<font color="yellow">the winner of the recent
Inha Competition, right?</font>

269
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:54,934
<font color="yellow">No, he's not.</font>

270
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:57,874
<font color="yellow">My son took the third place.</font>

271
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,003
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

272
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:03,604
<font color="yellow">The mother of the winner is not here.</font>

273
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:08,304
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

274
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:10,834
<font color="yellow">where should I go to meet her?</font>

275
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:19,774
<font color="yellow">Thank you for the flowers.</font>

276
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:22,604
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you will be blessed.</font>

277
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,534
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

278
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,204
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

279
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,604
<font color="yellow">I don't think we've met before.</font>

280
00:18:30,874 --> 00:18:32,704
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry I don't recognize you.</font>

281
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:35,104
<font color="yellow">It's all right.</font>

282
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:38,904
<font color="yellow">It's not been long since I came to church.</font>

283
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,704
<font color="yellow">I heard...</font>

284
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:46,234
<font color="yellow">that there's a great singer
in this church's choir.</font>

285
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,374
<font color="yellow">That's my youngest son.</font>

286
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,374
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

287
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,904
<font color="yellow">He's the winner of Inha competition...</font>

288
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,304
<font color="yellow">which is the largest one in Korea, right?</font>

289
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,674
<font color="yellow">Isn't he?</font>

290
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:05,334
<font color="yellow">No. My son got the second place.</font>

291
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:06,534
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

292
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,334
<font color="yellow">The winner isn't here.</font>

293
00:19:12,074 --> 00:19:13,304
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

294
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:16,974
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

295
00:19:21,074 --> 00:19:28,034
<font color="yellow">(3000 bows)</font>

296
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:42,644
<font color="yellow">3000 bows...</font>

297
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:46,374
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

298
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:49,334
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

299
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:52,604
<font color="yellow">All right. Let's draw a conclusion, then.</font>

300
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,774
<font color="yellow">Let's start from Producer Kim.
Which one do you want?</font>

301
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,974
<font color="yellow">I like the third one.</font>

302
00:19:58,144 --> 00:20:00,103
<font color="yellow">As the life is rough,</font>

303
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:02,273
<font color="yellow">even I feel exhausted when I read...</font>

304
00:20:02,274 --> 00:20:03,874
<font color="yellow">complicated and serious scenarios.</font>

305
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:07,474
<font color="yellow">I think choosing a light one
is strategically good as well.</font>

306
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:09,833
<font color="yellow">No way. Only young people will like it.</font>

307
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,274
<font color="yellow">I like the first one the most.</font>

308

<font color="yellow">It's about adults' passionate love.</font>

309
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,774
<font color="yellow">"Way to Incheon Port". The
title is fascinating.</font>

310
00:20:17,804 --> 00:20:19,834
<font color="yellow">What did they do on their
way to Incheon Port?</font>

311
00:20:20,034 --> 00:20:23,573
<font color="yellow">They wouldn't just stop at a
service area and have some snack.</font>

312
00:20:23,574 --> 00:20:25,644
<font color="yellow">But I don't like adultery.</font>

313
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:28,004
<font color="yellow">I like the third one like Producer Kim.</font>

314
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:29,434
<font color="yellow">I just feel like...</font>

315
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,234
<font color="yellow">people will like it.</font>

316
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,504
<font color="yellow">I like the third one, too.</font>

317
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:36,603
<font color="yellow">I think the writer is talented.
It's very fresh.</font>

318
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,333
<font color="yellow">The issue is whether it will
pass the censorship or not.</font>

319
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:40,574
<font color="yellow">I also like the third one.</font>

320
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:43,004
<font color="yellow">"Romance Learned through Books."</font>

321
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,604
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

322
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:47,103
<font color="yellow">If the quality of the script is
as good as that of the synopsis,</font>

323
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:48,474
<font color="yellow">it will be a hit.</font>

324
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:51,573
<font color="yellow">This is a new writing style. Director Han,</font>

325
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:52,934
<font color="yellow">is it written by a budding writer?</font>

326
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:56,373
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

327
00:20:56,374 --> 00:20:58,833
<font color="yellow">Still, the writer doesn't
seem like a complete novice.</font>

328
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:01,504
<font color="yellow">It's good since it's not awkward
while it's fresh and unique.</font>

329
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,274
<font color="yellow">Then, I'll leave the negotiation to you.</font>

330
00:21:04,604 --> 00:21:05,874
<font color="yellow">We'll go with this one.</font>

331
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,604
<font color="yellow">What's the name of the writer?</font>

332
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:19,033
<font color="yellow">Hello, I'm from the headquarters.
I'm here for the assessment.</font>

333
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,233
<font color="yellow">- Welcome.
- Hello.</font>

334
00:21:20,234 --> 00:21:22,673

- I'm okay.</font>

335
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:24,274
<font color="yellow">Do you want some hot tea?</font>

336
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:26,034
<font color="yellow">Yes, please. Thank you.</font>

337
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:29,874
<font color="yellow">Director Han, who's the writer?</font>

338
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,034
<font color="yellow">Why are you silent?</font>

339
00:21:34,404 --> 00:21:35,404
<font color="yellow">Director Han.</font>

340
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:38,904
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

341
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:40,804
<font color="yellow">the writer is...</font>

342
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:46,674
<font color="yellow">Oh Dong Hui.</font>

343
00:21:47,034 --> 00:21:48,274
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Pardon?</font>

344
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:56,834
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui?</font>

345
00:21:56,934 --> 00:21:58,734
<font color="yellow">You mean Dong Hui in our office?</font>

346
00:21:59,504 --> 00:22:00,534
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

347
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:04,004
<font color="yellow">Yes, Assistant Dong Hui wrote the scenario.</font>

348
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:11,104
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the Dong Hui...</font>

349
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,534
<font color="yellow">who's visiting stores outside now?</font>

350
00:22:14,574 --> 00:22:15,604
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

351
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,004
<font color="yellow">Are you out of mind?</font>

352
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:27,503
<font color="yellow">This is your workplace.</font>

353
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:30,174
<font color="yellow">This place isn't for your
romantic relationship!</font>

354
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:32,734
<font color="yellow">- Director Bang.
- I said we should focus on work.</font>

355
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,204
<font color="yellow">I said you and Dong Hui
should focus on work.</font>

356
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:36,904
<font color="yellow">Do you have to do this...</font>

357
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:39,004
<font color="yellow">in the same office with me?</font>

358
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,633
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

359
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,504
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm a fool?</font>

360
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,724
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't
notice if you stayed silent?</font>

361
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:47,804
<font color="yellow">Is this why you two were in
the rooftop room together?</font>

362
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,004
<font color="yellow">Is this what you did there?</font>

363
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,574
<font color="yellow">Do you want to make your precious
Dong Hui become a writer...</font>

364
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,534
<font color="yellow">even by using such a dirty means?</font>

365
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:54,804
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

366
00:22:55,804 --> 00:22:57,304
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

367
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:01,274
<font color="yellow">Do you think I showed you her scenario...</font>

368
00:23:01,774 --> 00:23:03,674
<font color="yellow">because I love her?</font>

369
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:04,833
<font color="yellow">Then, why did you do that?</font>

370
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:06,834
<font color="yellow">Do you really think I'm such a scum?</font>

371
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:10,034
<font color="yellow">This is my job and my career.</font>

372
00:23:10,434 --> 00:23:13,604

is riding on this project.</font>

<font color="yellow">And...</font>

374
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:19,533
<font color="yellow">you think I showed you the script
just to flirt with Dong Hui?</font>

375
00:23:19,534 --> 00:23:22,503
<font color="yellow">Do you think her scenario is
good enough to be selected?</font>

376
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:23,734
<font color="yellow">You already recognized her writing.</font>

377

is better than the rest.</font>

read the scenarios over again.</font>

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,874
<font color="yellow">He seemed very happy.</font>

441
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:04,904
<font color="yellow">Then, go tell him that
you're his brother...</font>

442
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:08,204
<font color="yellow">and you'd been looking for him.
Apologize to him for taking so long.</font>

<font color="yellow">I can't.</font>

444
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:16,934
<font color="yellow">- I can't do that.
- Why not?</font>

445
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,704
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's a good idea...</font>

446
00:29:23,634 --> 00:29:25,504
<font color="yellow">to show up in front of him.</font>

447
00:29:28,404 --> 00:29:32,374
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? You've
been waiting for that moment.</font>

448
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:34,874
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

449
00:29:36,404 --> 00:29:38,204
<font color="yellow">This is the day I've been waiting for.</font>

450
00:29:40,674 --> 00:29:42,434
<font color="yellow">I overcame all the hardships...</font>

451
00:29:43,974 --> 00:29:46,234
<font color="yellow">only for this moment.</font>

452
00:29:48,904 --> 00:29:50,404
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd want nothing more...</font>

453
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:53,934
<font color="yellow">only if I could find him.</font>

454

<font color="yellow">That doesn't make sense at all!</font>

457
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,104
<font color="yellow">I really have no idea what to do.</font>

458
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:14,134
<font color="yellow">I don't know what choice
I should make for him.</font>

459
00:30:25,804 --> 00:30:27,504
<font color="yellow">Poor Hyun Woo.</font>

460

<font color="yellow">and get Kimchi all over your shirt.</font>

614
00:39:32,274 --> 00:39:35,474
<font color="yellow">It's going to get covered in food.
Don't you think I know you?</font>

615
00:39:36,304 --> 00:39:37,374
<font color="yellow">I no longer...</font>

616
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,504
<font color="yellow">eat too much.</font>

617
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:41,204
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

618
00:39:41,604 --> 00:39:45,304
<font color="yellow">My mother said I should have
class to study classical music.</font>

619
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:47,874
<font color="yellow">I have to sing, so I don't
have to lose any weight.</font>

620
00:39:48,174 --> 00:39:50,204
<font color="yellow">But she said I shouldn't
gain any more weight.</font>

621
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:51,604
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

622
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,904
<font color="yellow">I've decided to drink this
refreshing iced barley tea...</font>

623
00:39:55,544 --> 00:39:56,974
<font color="yellow">for dinner.</font>

624
00:40:00,174 --> 00:40:01,974
<font color="yellow">Then I will get going then.</font>

625
00:40:05,604 --> 00:40:06,604
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

626
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,374
<font color="yellow">- Go inside your room fast.
- Don't upset me more.</font>

627
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:12,934
<font color="yellow">Be patient. My mother said I shouldn't...</font>

628
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:15,544
<font color="yellow">act rashly if I were to do classical music.</font>

629
00:40:22,274 --> 00:40:23,504
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo!</font>

630
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,004
<font color="yellow">My head hurts.</font>

631
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:34,634
<font color="yellow">My head hurts. What's wrong with my life?</font>

632
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,774
<font color="yellow">Why did our children have to be switched?</font>

633
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:45,043
<font color="yellow">I really want to move. I want to move.</font>

634
00:40:45,044 --> 00:40:46,504
<font color="yellow">It's killing me.</font>

635
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:53,934
<font color="yellow">Hey, where are you now?</font>

636
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:58,874
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can go
home today, Hye Sook.</font>

637
00:40:59,204 --> 00:41:00,704
<font color="yellow">Why not? Where are you?</font>

638
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:03,874
<font color="yellow">I'm at a Buddhist temple.</font>

639
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,274
<font color="yellow">Why did you go there?</font>

640
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:10,503
<font color="yellow">I have to bow 3,000 times today.</font>

641
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,274
<font color="yellow">So please take care of the kids.</font>

642
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:15,174
<font color="yellow">Please prepare a suit for my
husband tomorrow morning.</font>

643
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:16,774
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

644
00:41:17,134 --> 00:41:18,734
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook!</font>

645
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,074
<font color="yellow">Thank you, Hee Sook.</font>

646
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:11,504
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

647
00:42:12,304 --> 00:42:15,074
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Did you come for your son?</font>

648
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:18,204
<font color="yellow">Yes. My son is a musician.</font>

649
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:21,304
<font color="yellow">I am praying so that he will
do well in a competition.</font>

650
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,974
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

651
00:42:23,704 --> 00:42:26,174
<font color="yellow">My son is a musician, too.</font>

652
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:27,804
<font color="yellow">He has to...</font>

653
00:42:28,674 --> 00:42:29,974
<font color="yellow">go on a competition, too.</font>

654
00:42:31,574 --> 00:42:32,574
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

655
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:11,634
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, I feel sad. Don't bother me.</font>

656
00:43:12,604 --> 00:43:14,673
<font color="yellow">I am going to bite anyone...</font>

657
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:16,834
<font color="yellow">who bothers me today.</font>

658
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:18,804
<font color="yellow">So don't bother me.</font>

659
00:44:12,074 --> 00:44:13,304
<font color="yellow">Pour me a drink, will you?</font>

660
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,734
<font color="yellow">Do you mind if I join you?</font>

661
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:48,674
<font color="yellow">Let me.</font>

662
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,734
<font color="yellow">I'll pour you one.</font>

663
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:05,504
<font color="yellow">This is unexpected.</font>

664
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,604
<font color="yellow">I thought you hated me.</font>

665
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:12,134
<font color="yellow">I still don't like you very much.</font>

666
00:45:17,674 --> 00:45:21,074
<font color="yellow">I feel like you're
hovering around my family.</font>

667
00:45:22,504 --> 00:45:25,504
<font color="yellow">I still have doubts about you.</font>

668
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:30,274
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

669
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:38,034
<font color="yellow">I thought maybe you have
something you want to say to me.</font>

670
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,034
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

671
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,204
<font color="yellow">you called me that night.</font>

672
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:57,934
<font color="yellow">Do you think so?</font>

673
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,704
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

674
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,104
<font color="yellow">Did I hear it wrong?</font>

675
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,374
<font color="yellow">No. I called you Sang Woo.</font>

676
00:46:11,534 --> 00:46:12,604
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo...</font>

677
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:17,374
<font color="yellow">Who is Sang Woo?</font>

678
00:46:21,774 --> 00:46:22,934
<font color="yellow">He's my brother.</font>

679
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,474
<font color="yellow">- Hi, Mom.
- Where are you?</font>

680
00:46:45,574 --> 00:46:47,904
<font color="yellow">- I'm at a place near our house.
- Have you had dinner?</font>

681
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,104
<font color="yellow">How are you going to eat dinner?</font>

682
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,933
<font color="yellow">You should tell me how you'll eat dinner,</font>

683
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:57,904
<font color="yellow">so I can know whether I
should fix you dinner or not.</font>

684
00:46:58,704 --> 00:47:01,274
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. I'll
go and do it myself.</font>

685
00:47:03,474 --> 00:47:06,274
<font color="yellow">I made kimchi stew today.</font>

686
00:47:06,304 --> 00:47:08,674
<font color="yellow">Come and eat it before the meat gets cold.</font>

687
00:47:09,134 --> 00:47:12,074
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will. See you soon, Mom.</font>

688
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,474
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

689
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,304
<font color="yellow">If you haven't had dinner
yet, you can order some food.</font>

690
00:47:23,934 --> 00:47:27,804
<font color="yellow">No. My mom says she made
kimchi stew at home.</font>

691
00:47:28,834 --> 00:47:31,004
<font color="yellow">She must've worked hard to make it.</font>

692
00:47:31,574 --> 00:47:33,804
<font color="yellow">I should go and eat it.</font>

693
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:39,104
<font color="yellow">- I see.
- That's right.</font>

694
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:44,874
<font color="yellow">You said your brother's
name is Sang Woo, right?</font>

695
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:48,334
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

696
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:53,434
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you before?</font>

697
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,774
<font color="yellow">I have a brother who is around your age.</font>

698
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:06,574
<font color="yellow">I lost him when I was seven years old.</font>

699
00:48:08,474 --> 00:48:09,834
<font color="yellow">His name is Lee Sang Woo.</font>

700
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:13,534
<font color="yellow">He's the same age as you.</font>

701
00:48:17,334 --> 00:48:18,574
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

702
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:23,174
<font color="yellow">I moved to this neighborhood to find him,</font>

703
00:48:24,674 --> 00:48:25,774
<font color="yellow">and I found out...</font>

704
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,704
<font color="yellow">you've been adopted.</font>

705
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:33,174
<font color="yellow">That's why I...</font>

706
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:36,934
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

707
00:48:38,804 --> 00:48:41,085
<font color="yellow">I asked you a question about
a sensitive matter abruptly.</font>

708
00:48:42,974 --> 00:48:44,004
<font color="yellow">That's what happened.</font>

709
00:48:45,904 --> 00:48:47,274
<font color="yellow">I didn't know.</font>

710
00:48:49,104 --> 00:48:51,274
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, too.</font>

711
00:48:54,274 --> 00:48:55,304
<font color="yellow">Not at all.</font>

712
00:48:58,304 --> 00:48:59,804
<font color="yellow">I've been hoping...</font>

713
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:04,274
<font color="yellow">my whole life that Sang Woo would have...</font>

714
00:49:06,604 --> 00:49:09,204
<font color="yellow">grown into a healthy and decent
man with a loving family...</font>

715
00:49:10,234 --> 00:49:12,104
<font color="yellow">just like you.</font>

716
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:16,434
<font color="yellow">I guess...</font>

717
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:20,604
<font color="yellow">that's why I called you
Sang Woo without realizing.</font>

718
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,904
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

719
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:26,674
<font color="yellow">I didn't know that was the reason
for your kindness and interest.</font>

720
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,374
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

721
00:49:34,034 --> 00:49:35,834
<font color="yellow">did you find your brother?</font>

722
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:41,934
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you will find him.</font>

723
00:49:43,004 --> 00:49:44,034
<font color="yellow">I'm also sure...</font>

724
00:49:45,104 --> 00:49:48,334
<font color="yellow">he would've grown into a
better man than I am.</font>

725
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,974
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon.
- Yes?</font>

726
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:55,674
<font color="yellow">Are you happy with your family?</font>

727
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:58,604
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

728
00:49:59,504 --> 00:50:02,534
<font color="yellow">Is there anyone who is not
happy with their family?</font>

729
00:50:05,504 --> 00:50:07,104
<font color="yellow">To me, my family is...</font>

730
00:50:08,034 --> 00:50:09,934
<font color="yellow">more valuable than my own life.</font>

731
00:50:11,974 --> 00:50:13,004
<font color="yellow">I'm sure that...</font>

732
00:50:14,074 --> 00:50:15,574
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo would be as happy as me.</font>

733
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:17,904
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

734
00:50:51,604 --> 00:50:52,604
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

735
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:55,304
<font color="yellow">I lost.</font>

736
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:58,034
<font color="yellow">What do you mean, President Lee?</font>

737
00:51:01,074 --> 00:51:02,904
<font color="yellow">I think Hyung Seop has...</font>

738
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:05,774
<font color="yellow">defeated me.</font>

739
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:21,274
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it hurts.</font>

740
00:51:22,774 --> 00:51:24,104
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, what on earth...</font>

741
00:51:26,434 --> 00:51:27,734
<font color="yellow">I made...</font>

742
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:32,174
<font color="yellow">I made 3,000 bows at the temple.</font>

743
00:51:36,074 --> 00:51:38,434
<font color="yellow">- Hee Sook. Are you okay?
- Gosh.</font>

744
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:43,104
<font color="yellow">I think I'm going to enter nirvana soon.</font>

745
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:47,034
<font color="yellow">You can't enter nirvana. Hold on.</font>

746
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:49,774
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

747
00:51:52,704 --> 00:51:55,304
<font color="yellow">By the way, Mother is very upset, Hee Sook.</font>

748
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,934
<font color="yellow">I don't care.</font>

749
00:52:00,874 --> 00:52:03,304
<font color="yellow">Here. Look.</font>

750
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:04,534
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

751
00:52:04,534 --> 00:52:05,534
<font color="yellow">(Mr. Kang)</font>

752
00:52:05,804 --> 00:52:09,034
<font color="yellow">He's the best vocal music teacher there is.</font>

753
00:52:11,734 --> 00:52:13,704
<font color="yellow">He's the best teacher in this country.</font>

754
00:52:14,304 --> 00:52:16,274
<font color="yellow">How did you get his number?</font>

755
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,774
<font color="yellow">After I made 3,000 bows at the temple,</font>

756
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,274
<font color="yellow">I thought I was going to die, Hye Joo.</font>

757
00:52:24,204 --> 00:52:26,873
<font color="yellow">You know I hardly make bows...</font>

758
00:52:26,874 --> 00:52:28,704
<font color="yellow">to anyone.</font>

759
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:31,634
<font color="yellow">I do know. You're an arrogant person.</font>

760
00:52:31,674 --> 00:52:33,004
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Hye Joo.</font>

761
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:36,934
<font color="yellow">I really...</font>

762
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:41,574
<font color="yellow">made 3,000 bows at the temple.</font>

763
00:52:41,604 --> 00:52:43,174
<font color="yellow">- My gosh, it hurts.
- Really?</font>

764
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:48,734
<font color="yellow">By the way, is this 6 or 8?</font>

765
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:51,004
<font color="yellow">I think it got smudged by your sweat.</font>

766
00:52:52,674 --> 00:52:54,704
<font color="yellow">- What did you say?
- Here.</font>

767
00:53:01,174 --> 00:53:02,374
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying, Chang Soo?</font>

768
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:07,004
<font color="yellow">Mom. Kids at school make fun of me.</font>

769
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,904
<font color="yellow">Why? With what?</font>

770
00:53:10,004 --> 00:53:12,874
<font color="yellow">They say my face looks
bigger with this hair.</font>

771
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:16,774
<font color="yellow">What? Who said that?</font>

772
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:19,534
<font color="yellow">Who said my son's face is big?</font>

773
00:53:20,274 --> 00:53:21,274
<font color="yellow">The kids at school.</font>

774
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:29,404
<font color="yellow">I will go and teach them a lesson.</font>

775
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:32,074
<font color="yellow">Gosh. My son doesn't have a big face.</font>

776
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:33,934
<font color="yellow">Don't cry.</font>

777
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:38,273
<font color="yellow">Your face isn't big at all. My goodness.</font>

778
00:53:38,274 --> 00:53:40,234
<font color="yellow">My poor baby.</font>

779
00:53:40,404 --> 00:53:41,574
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

780
00:53:42,604 --> 00:53:45,004
<font color="yellow">I should really move out of this house.</font>

781
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:55,474
<font color="yellow">No. I must be crazy.</font>

782
00:53:55,874 --> 00:53:58,104
<font color="yellow">I guess I'm still crazy. No.</font>

783
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:03,574
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

784
00:54:03,704 --> 00:54:05,334
<font color="yellow">Yes. Hello.</font>

785
00:54:05,634 --> 00:54:07,574
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo. Come and say hello.</font>

786
00:54:07,904 --> 00:54:09,803
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hi, Chang Soo.</font>

787
00:54:09,804 --> 00:54:11,204
<font color="yellow">Come and have a seat.</font>

788
00:54:11,934 --> 00:54:13,934
<font color="yellow">Here. Let's sit.</font>

789
00:54:14,174 --> 00:54:16,774
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Hee Sook. What's wrong?</font>

790
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:21,134
<font color="yellow">Well... It's nothing. I'm fine, Aunt.</font>

791
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:23,234
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

792
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:26,374
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo. I heard that you
study vocal music now.</font>

793
00:54:26,674 --> 00:54:28,504
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- My gosh.</font>

794
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:31,474
<font color="yellow">I've never imagined that
you'd study singing.</font>

795
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:34,404
<font color="yellow">That makes two of us.</font>

796
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:38,704
<font color="yellow">That's right. Have you found a teacher yet?</font>

797
00:54:38,974 --> 00:54:42,174
<font color="yellow">I don't think Professor Park can teach you.</font>

798
00:54:42,734 --> 00:54:44,674
<font color="yellow">You're right. That's why...</font>

799
00:54:44,904 --> 00:54:46,633
<font color="yellow">I think I will let him teach Chang Soo.</font>

800
00:54:46,634 --> 00:54:48,574
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you know him.</font>

801
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:52,904
<font color="yellow">Well, he's not such a great teacher.</font>

802
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:57,833
<font color="yellow">Wait. Why not? Among other parents,</font>

803
00:54:57,834 --> 00:55:00,634
<font color="yellow">he's considered as the best teacher.</font>

804
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:03,874
<font color="yellow">It was so hard for me to get his number.</font>

805
00:55:05,234 --> 00:55:07,973
<font color="yellow">People like you who don't know him well...</font>

806
00:55:07,974 --> 00:55:10,604
<font color="yellow">would think that he is a great teacher.</font>

807
00:55:10,934 --> 00:55:12,634
<font color="yellow">But the way I see it,</font>

808
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:16,533
<font color="yellow">everyone is just mediocre except for...</font>

809
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:18,074
<font color="yellow">one man.</font>

810
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:21,174
<font color="yellow">One man? Who is that?</font>

811
00:55:23,034 --> 00:55:24,134
<font color="yellow">He was...</font>

812
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:27,074
<font color="yellow">the best singer I've ever known.</font>

813
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:30,274
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Who is it?</font>

814
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:33,933
<font color="yellow">Just someone I know. Stop asking.
It's painful to talk about him.</font>

815
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:36,004
<font color="yellow">Just let Mr. Kang teach Chang Soo.</font>

816
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,354
<font color="yellow">"It's painful to talk about him"?</font>

817
00:55:39,034 --> 00:55:41,573
<font color="yellow">If Chang Soo is going to
work as a singer in Korea,</font>

818
00:55:41,574 --> 00:55:43,104
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kang won't be a bad teacher.</font>

819
00:55:43,234 --> 00:55:45,104
<font color="yellow">I just have high standards.</font>

820
00:55:45,534 --> 00:55:48,533
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Who is that man?
Tell me more about him.</font>

821
00:55:48,534 --> 00:55:49,904
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

822
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:02,904
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Aunt. Come on.</font>

823
00:56:03,104 --> 00:56:06,174
<font color="yellow">Who is the man you just mentioned?</font>

824
00:56:06,704 --> 00:56:08,674
<font color="yellow">Could you please tell me? Please.</font>

825
00:56:09,474 --> 00:56:10,874
<font color="yellow">Stop bothering me.</font>

826
00:56:11,074 --> 00:56:13,374
<font color="yellow">I'm listening to music. Be quiet.</font>

827
00:56:15,174 --> 00:56:17,134
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Please tell me who he is.</font>

828
00:56:57,634 --> 00:56:58,704
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

829
00:56:58,904 --> 00:57:00,374
<font color="yellow">Can I see you for a second?</font>

830
00:57:12,734 --> 00:57:15,104
<font color="yellow">I'm surprised that you let
me come into your workroom.</font>

831
00:57:18,704 --> 00:57:19,834
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

832
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:23,474
<font color="yellow">could you do such thing without
discussing it with me?</font>

833
00:57:23,734 --> 00:57:25,833
<font color="yellow">- Dong Hui.
- You know better than anyone...</font>

834
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:27,874
<font color="yellow">that I've worked so hard to write...</font>

835
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,374
<font color="yellow">each and every word of it.</font>

836
00:57:29,534 --> 00:57:31,334
<font color="yellow">How could you do such a thing?</font>

837
00:57:31,804 --> 00:57:34,734
<font color="yellow">Why did you use my script
without asking me first?</font>

838
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:37,704
<font color="yellow">Why did you sell my baby
without my approval?</font>

839
00:57:38,174 --> 00:57:39,204
<font color="yellow">How is it...</font>

840
00:57:39,574 --> 00:57:41,204
<font color="yellow">just your baby?</font>

841
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:44,034
<font color="yellow">I also helped that script grow.</font>

842
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:45,134
<font color="yellow">Even so,</font>

843
00:57:45,604 --> 00:57:47,804
<font color="yellow">you didn't have to do that.</font>

844
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:51,834
<font color="yellow">Now people say I'm debuting because
of you, not because of my work.</font>

845
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:54,534
<font color="yellow">Are you complaining about it?</font>

846
00:57:55,474 --> 00:57:57,373
<font color="yellow">I chose good synopses among...</font>

847
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:59,534
<font color="yellow">the ones I had, and gave
them out to the team.</font>

848
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,004
<font color="yellow">We took a vote, and your work was chosen.</font>

849
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,504
<font color="yellow">I never forced anyone to pick yours.</font>

850
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:09,103
<font color="yellow">I'm asking why you included
mine along with those...</font>

851
00:58:09,104 --> 00:58:10,634
<font color="yellow">great synopses.</font>

852
00:58:10,704 --> 00:58:13,533
<font color="yellow">They picked yours without
realizing that it's yours.</font>

853
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:15,474
<font color="yellow">If they had known, they
wouldn't have picked it.</font>

854
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:17,134
<font color="yellow">They know they shouldn't.</font>

855
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:18,433
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

856
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:20,634
<font color="yellow">Why are you so insecure
about your own work?</font>

857
00:58:20,904 --> 00:58:24,474
<font color="yellow">You call it your baby. How could
you have such little trust in it?</font>

858
00:58:24,774 --> 00:58:26,304
<font color="yellow">- Look.
- Also,</font>

859
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:29,034
<font color="yellow">who says I helped you make your debut?</font>

860
00:58:29,334 --> 00:58:32,173
<font color="yellow">Does that mean I helped
you debut because...</font>

861
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:34,274
<font color="yellow">I want to get on the right side of you?</font>

862
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:36,134
<font color="yellow">Why would I?</font>

863
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:39,704
<font color="yellow">Why do I have to try to be in your favor?</font>

864
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:41,304
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

865
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:43,204
<font color="yellow">This is so insulting.</font>

866
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:46,174
<font color="yellow">What do you all take me for?</font>

867
00:58:46,704 --> 00:58:50,174
<font color="yellow">I'm confident that I'm
a competent producer.</font>

868
00:58:50,274 --> 00:58:54,134
<font color="yellow">Even if they give me 100 beautiful
actresses like Scarlett Johansson,</font>

869
00:58:54,434 --> 00:58:55,903
<font color="yellow">I would never trade it...</font>

870
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:58,303
<font color="yellow">with one great script.</font>

871
00:58:58,304 --> 00:58:59,934
<font color="yellow">- Do you get it?
- My gosh.</font>

872
00:59:00,774 --> 00:59:03,574
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, I will never do it.
I wanted to let you know.</font>

873
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:04,734
<font color="yellow">Forget it, then.</font>

874
00:59:04,904 --> 00:59:07,033
<font color="yellow">You're kicking away your own fortune.</font>

875
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:09,334
<font color="yellow">A great opportunity comes
along, but you don't take it.</font>

876
00:59:09,374 --> 00:59:10,704
<font color="yellow">Suit yourself, then.</font>

877
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:13,274
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

878
00:59:13,374 --> 00:59:15,474
<font color="yellow">Did you just yell at me?</font>

879
00:59:15,534 --> 00:59:17,734
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did. What are you going to do?</font>

880
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,173
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Hey!</font>

881
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:20,174
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

882
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:35,674
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to eat lunch?</font>

883
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:38,404
<font color="yellow">I'm just going to take a rest.</font>

884
00:59:40,774 --> 00:59:43,934
<font color="yellow">Are you getting ready for the
stockholders' meeting tomorrow?</font>

885
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:45,634
<font color="yellow">Please get out.</font>

886
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:57,134
<font color="yellow">Lunch is ready, Sir.</font>

887
00:59:59,074 --> 01:00:01,674
<font color="yellow">Gosh. It's bean paste stew again.</font>

888
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:06,174
<font color="yellow">I like bean paste stew very much.</font>

889
01:00:08,074 --> 01:00:10,373
<font color="yellow">How long have you been
working in our house?</font>

890
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,274
<font color="yellow">It's been five years.</font>

891
01:00:13,134 --> 01:00:14,404
<font color="yellow">It hasn't been that long.</font>

892
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:18,534
<font color="yellow">We once had a housekeeper who
worked here for 20 years.</font>

893
01:00:20,274 --> 01:00:22,734
<font color="yellow">She made...</font>

894
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,474
<font color="yellow">such delicious bean paste stew.</font>

895
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:28,634
<font color="yellow">President Bang.</font>

896
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,404
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

897
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:35,374
<font color="yellow">So, how did it go?</font>

898
01:00:41,674 --> 01:00:42,734
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

899
01:00:44,234 --> 01:00:46,404
<font color="yellow">I said I'll fold it for you.</font>

900
01:00:46,774 --> 01:00:48,434
<font color="yellow">Just eat your tangerines.</font>

901
01:00:49,134 --> 01:00:52,134
<font color="yellow">I'll fold my own laundry.</font>

902
01:00:53,104 --> 01:00:56,504
<font color="yellow">I know that you're bothered
that I'm living off you.</font>

903
01:00:56,804 --> 01:00:59,634
<font color="yellow">I can imagine what you're going to say...</font>

904
01:00:59,674 --> 01:01:02,173
<font color="yellow">if I ask you to fold my laundry.</font>

905
01:01:02,174 --> 01:01:04,134
<font color="yellow">Why would I hear that?</font>

906
01:01:05,534 --> 01:01:09,604
<font color="yellow">Is it because of what my
daughter-in-law said the other day?</font>

907
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,804
<font color="yellow">Forget about what she said.</font>

908
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:17,404
<font color="yellow">She didn't mean it in a bad way.</font>

909
01:01:18,004 --> 01:01:21,273
<font color="yellow">She was just worried that
Dong Hui should marry...</font>

910
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:22,634
<font color="yellow">That's my point.</font>

911
01:01:22,974 --> 01:01:25,203
<font color="yellow">Why would your family worry about...</font>

912
01:01:25,204 --> 01:01:27,434
<font color="yellow">whom my granddaughter will marry?</font>

913
01:01:27,574 --> 01:01:30,833
<font color="yellow">They're not just my family.
You shouldn't say that.</font>

914
01:01:30,834 --> 01:01:34,004
<font color="yellow">We've been living in the
same roof for months now.</font>

915
01:01:34,504 --> 01:01:38,074
<font color="yellow">People don't even treat
their dog so coldheartedly.</font>

916
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:41,074
<font color="yellow">Are you likening Dong Hui to a dog now?</font>

917
01:01:41,134 --> 01:01:42,833
<font color="yellow">Like your dog, Moong Chi?</font>

918
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:45,033
<font color="yellow">Why do you always get upset whenever...</font>

919
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,704
<font color="yellow">we talk about Dong Hui?</font>

920
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:49,874
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I don't understand.</font>

921
01:01:52,104 --> 01:01:54,074
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Forget I said anything.</font>

922
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:58,334
<font color="yellow">By the way, you said Dong Hui was...</font>

923
01:01:59,034 --> 01:02:02,534
<font color="yellow">the granddaughter of your brother, right?</font>

924
01:02:02,804 --> 01:02:05,333
<font color="yellow">His son and son's wife suddenly died...</font>

925
01:02:05,334 --> 01:02:06,504
<font color="yellow">in an accident.</font>

926
01:02:06,674 --> 01:02:09,604
<font color="yellow">You said that's why you
started to raise Dong Hui.</font>

927
01:02:10,604 --> 01:02:13,673
<font color="yellow">Why are you so interested in Dong Hui?</font>

928
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:15,554
<font color="yellow">What do you want to know
about my dear Dong Hui?</font>

929
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:17,634
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting so angry?</font>

930
01:02:18,174 --> 01:02:21,633
<font color="yellow">I just thought maybe I can
fix her up with someone.</font>

931
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:23,503
<font color="yellow">If you want to fix someone up,</font>

932
01:02:23,504 --> 01:02:25,534
<font color="yellow">you should fix up your
60-year-old daughter.</font>

933
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:26,704
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

934
01:02:26,974 --> 01:02:29,634
<font color="yellow">Are you attacking my weak spot?</font>

935
01:02:30,274 --> 01:02:33,103
<font color="yellow">I'm only saying this because you keep...</font>

936
01:02:33,104 --> 01:02:35,234
<font color="yellow">talking about Dong Hui.</font>

937
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,833
<font color="yellow">We have a man and a woman who
are at a marriageable age.</font>

938
01:02:38,834 --> 01:02:40,903
<font color="yellow">Isn't it natural that...</font>

939
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:43,874
<font color="yellow">we talk about their marriage?</font>

940
01:02:44,204 --> 01:02:45,534
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui isn't...</font>

941
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:49,373
<font color="yellow">someone I can give away to
anybody just because...</font>

942
01:02:49,374 --> 01:02:51,734
<font color="yellow">she's old enough to marry.</font>

943
01:02:51,904 --> 01:02:53,474
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't...</font>

944
01:02:53,634 --> 01:02:56,934
<font color="yellow">treat her this way just because
she doesn't have parents.</font>

945
01:02:58,304 --> 01:03:01,234
<font color="yellow">It's not like she's from
a rich family. Gosh.</font>

946
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:04,873
<font color="yellow">Whether you have parents or not,
you marry someone eventually.</font>

947
01:03:04,874 --> 01:03:07,273
<font color="yellow">Why do you think Dong Hui is so special?</font>

948
01:03:07,274 --> 01:03:08,834
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

949
01:03:10,974 --> 01:03:14,674
<font color="yellow">Anyhow, don't speak inappropriately
just because we live together.</font>

950
01:03:15,174 --> 01:03:18,634
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Why don't you stop
being inappropriate first?</font>

951
01:03:20,034 --> 01:03:22,504
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? What are you talking about?</font>

952
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:24,134
<font color="yellow">Why am I being appropriate?</font>

953
01:03:24,274 --> 01:03:27,234
<font color="yellow">Did you think I wouldn't know?
You're seeing a man.</font>

954
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,034
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

955
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:30,434
<font color="yellow">It's true.</font>

956
01:03:30,504 --> 01:03:32,034
<font color="yellow">Do you think I don't know about it?</font>

957
01:03:32,234 --> 01:03:35,404
<font color="yellow">Gosh, every night,</font>

958
01:03:35,534 --> 01:03:37,634
<font color="yellow">you hide and talk to a guy.</font>

959
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:40,604
<font color="yellow">You are so secretive about it...</font>

960
01:03:40,704 --> 01:03:43,603
<font color="yellow">that you won't even introduce his
friend to your lonely friend.</font>

961
01:03:43,604 --> 01:03:45,104
<font color="yellow">You enjoy it alone.</font>

962
01:03:45,204 --> 01:03:48,303
<font color="yellow">I shared everything with you,
no matter how small it is.</font>

963
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:49,404
<font color="yellow">Do you know that?</font>

964
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:52,574
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

965
01:03:52,604 --> 01:03:56,534
<font color="yellow">They say sorrow reduces to half and
joy doubles when you share it.</font>

966
01:03:57,174 --> 01:04:00,633
<font color="yellow">I still can't get my head around...</font>

967
01:04:00,634 --> 01:04:02,634
<font color="yellow">about why men find you so charming.</font>

968
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,204
<font color="yellow">You always say you won't marry off
your daughter-in-law to anyone,</font>

969
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:08,634
<font color="yellow">and you lock her in a
room in her prime time.</font>

970
01:04:08,674 --> 01:04:11,834
<font color="yellow">Yet you always talk on the
phone with your boyfriend.</font>

971
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:14,304
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't care if you worked
at a building as a cleaner...</font>

972
01:04:14,474 --> 01:04:16,334
<font color="yellow">or if you went to a skating link...</font>

973
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:20,134
<font color="yellow">and broke your arm.</font>

974
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:23,104
<font color="yellow">What did you say? How dare you?</font>

975
01:04:24,504 --> 01:04:27,704
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, I am so upset.
- Goodness, Mother.</font>

976
01:04:29,274 --> 01:04:30,834
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you invite me to lunch?</font>

977
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:33,204
<font color="yellow">- Goodness.
- Did you not eat yet?</font>

978
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:35,603
<font color="yellow">- Have a seat, Mother.
- Nobody gave me food.</font>

979
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:37,504
<font color="yellow">Have a seat, Mother, I
will serve it to you.</font>

980
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:41,233
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you have lunch with Gui Boon?</font>

981
01:04:41,234 --> 01:04:44,174
<font color="yellow">Don't even mention her to me.
I really don't like her.</font>

982
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:46,204
<font color="yellow">Did something happen?</font>

983
01:04:46,234 --> 01:04:49,274
<font color="yellow">I offered to match her granddaughter,</font>

984
01:04:49,304 --> 01:04:52,573
<font color="yellow">and she yelled at me saying
that her granddaughter...</font>

985
01:04:52,574 --> 01:04:55,004
<font color="yellow">won't marry just anyone.</font>

986
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:57,574
<font color="yellow">- What?
- Is that true?</font>

987
01:04:57,674 --> 01:05:01,574
<font color="yellow">It is. Does she think her
granddaughter is precious,</font>

988
01:05:01,704 --> 01:05:03,374
<font color="yellow">and my grandson is not?</font>

989
01:05:03,474 --> 01:05:05,774
<font color="yellow">Is that what she thinks?</font>

990
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:10,474
<font color="yellow">I hate old people who think their
grandchild is the most precious.</font>

991
01:05:11,234 --> 01:05:14,704
<font color="yellow">I really think that way of
thinking should be eradicated.</font>

992
01:05:15,374 --> 01:05:19,104
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say that Dong Hui had
a rather unfortunate childhood?</font>

993
01:05:19,404 --> 01:05:20,804
<font color="yellow">I think that's what I heard.</font>

994
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,803
<font color="yellow">I heard she's the child of...</font>

995
01:05:22,804 --> 01:05:24,934
<font color="yellow">Gui Boon's brother's son.</font>

996
01:05:25,104 --> 01:05:27,703
<font color="yellow">The family got into an accident,
and only Dong Hui survived.</font>

997
01:05:27,704 --> 01:05:29,734
<font color="yellow">That's why Gui Boon raised her.</font>

998
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:32,734
<font color="yellow">Goodness, did that really happen?</font>

999
01:05:32,904 --> 01:05:36,103
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's why Gui Boon
is overprotecting her.</font>

1000
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:37,904
<font color="yellow">She thinks her granddaughter
is the most precious one.</font>

1001
01:05:38,074 --> 01:05:39,674
<font color="yellow">I hate her so much.</font>

1002
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,404
<font color="yellow">Calm down and have some sujebi.</font>

1003
01:05:44,374 --> 01:05:47,734
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui's born with a
life fitting for a writer.</font>

1004
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,904
<font color="yellow">Her life is full of stories.</font>

1005
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:53,234
<font color="yellow">- Stop it.
- What?</font>

1006
01:06:02,574 --> 01:06:05,034
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Madam.
- Goodness.</font>

1007
01:06:11,504 --> 01:06:12,604
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

1008
01:06:13,874 --> 01:06:16,434
<font color="yellow">Mom, it's me, Bang Jin.</font>

1009
01:06:17,234 --> 01:06:19,304
<font color="yellow">It's been such a long time.</font>

1010
01:06:20,674 --> 01:06:23,534
<font color="yellow">You look the same, Mom.</font>

1011
01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:39,934
<font color="yellow">Sir.</font>

1012
01:06:41,074 --> 01:06:42,174
<font color="yellow">It's ready.</font>

1013
01:07:13,134 --> 01:07:14,174
<font color="yellow">Sir?</font>

1014
01:07:16,734 --> 01:07:18,774
<font color="yellow">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

1015
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:40,474
<font color="yellow">Sir, it's Jeong Eun. What should I do?</font>

1016
01:07:49,304 --> 01:07:50,404
<font color="yellow">Let's just go.</font>

1017
01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:10,874
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

1018
01:08:11,474 --> 01:08:13,104
<font color="yellow">Are you home, Hyun Woo?</font>

1019
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:20,704
<font color="yellow">Where did he go? He's not
picking up his phone, either.</font>

1020
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,344
<font color="yellow">(Han Jeong Eun)</font>

1021
01:09:00,844 --> 01:09:02,704
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1022
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:04,174
<font color="yellow">Hyeon Jung?</font>

1023
01:09:05,034 --> 01:09:07,134
<font color="yellow">It's the late Gwang Ho's daughter.</font>

1024
01:09:07,504 --> 01:09:09,634
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

1025
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:12,844
<font color="yellow">- How dare you come here?
- Is Seong Joon well?</font>

1026
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:14,534
<font color="yellow">How much did it drop?</font>

1027
01:09:14,844 --> 01:09:18,674
<font color="yellow">I don't think I can get
away from Mom, Uncle.</font>

1028
01:09:19,504 --> 01:09:21,074
<font color="yellow">I was truthful.</font>

1029
01:09:21,474 --> 01:09:23,344
<font color="yellow">I treated you sincerely.</font>
