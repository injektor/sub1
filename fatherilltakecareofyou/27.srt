1
00:00:06,418 --> 00:00:07,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Would you like to order?</font>

2
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:08,988
<font color=#FFFF00>(Episode 27)</font>

3
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:12,688
<font color=#FFFF00>We will have two cups of this.</font>

4
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:15,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I see.</font>

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Here are your beverages.</font>

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:20,048
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so pretty.</font>

7
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:24,918
<font color=#FFFF00>It's delicious.</font>

8
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. Please enjoy.</font>

9
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Seong Joon?</font>

10
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:42,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun. It's me.</font>

11
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I have something to tell you.</font>

12
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,218
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Are you certain Hyun Woo is back?</font>

13
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:53,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am.</font>

14
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:57,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun, I thought about him a lot.
Something's fishy about him.</font>

15
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:01,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't figure out who and
what kind of a person he is.</font>

16
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:04,188
<font color=#FFFF00>He certainly said he
will return to New York.</font>

17
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:06,158
<font color=#FFFF00>He even invested in my
company before leaving.</font>

18
00:01:07,288 --> 00:01:08,688
<font color=#FFFF00>He came back this morning.</font>

19
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:11,058
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the reason behind his return?</font>

20
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:12,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun.</font>

21
00:01:12,858 --> 00:01:14,418
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't get in touch with you at all?</font>

22
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:16,648
<font color=#FFFF00>No, he didn't.</font>

23
00:01:18,088 --> 00:01:21,047
<font color=#FFFF00>Something's off about him. He
seems like he's playing us.</font>

24
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:23,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. Calm down.</font>

25
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:26,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me look into it. I'm sure
there was a reason for it.</font>

26
00:01:29,388 --> 00:01:30,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I will find out.</font>

27
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:41,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

28
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:45,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

29
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:50,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

30
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:52,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

31
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:56,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

32
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:00,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you? Tell me who you are.</font>

33
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:03,088
<font color=#FFFF00>You took your anger out on the driver...</font>

34
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:06,648
<font color=#FFFF00>and that poor man hung himself.</font>

35
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:09,418
<font color=#FFFF00>One of his sons...</font>

36
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:13,758
<font color=#FFFF00>was hit by a dump truck and torn apart.</font>

37
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:16,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

38
00:02:17,258 --> 00:02:18,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

39
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:21,818
<font color=#FFFF00>the driver's son?</font>

40
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,188
<font color=#FFFF00>"As you sow, so shall you reap."</font>

41
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:28,048
<font color=#FFFF00>You thought you won't
face the consequences?</font>

42
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:31,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think...</font>

43
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,888
<font color=#FFFF00>karma doesn't apply to you?</font>

44
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:35,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Does this mean...</font>

45
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:39,088
<font color=#FFFF00>you were behind Guem Ja's
arrest and kicked out Mi Ja?</font>

46
00:02:46,218 --> 00:02:48,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee. Please forgive me this once.</font>

47
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:53,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't doing so well at that time.</font>

48
00:02:54,088 --> 00:02:57,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Guem Ja said she would pay me.
That was the only time.</font>

49
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:00,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Please, I beg of you, Mr. Lee.</font>

50
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Please forgive me this once.</font>

51
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,188
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I forgive you?</font>

52
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,717
<font color=#FFFF00>The incident was...</font>

53
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:16,148
<font color=#FFFF00>already settled as drunk-driving
of an alcoholic driver.</font>

54
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:19,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I just came...</font>

55
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:22,288
<font color=#FFFF00>to tell you that I was very disappointed.</font>

56
00:03:24,848 --> 00:03:26,418
<font color=#FFFF00>After 23 years, I wanted...</font>

57
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:30,148
<font color=#FFFF00>to tell the neighbors that in
many ways, I was disappointed.</font>

58
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I came back to tell you that.</font>

59
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:36,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

60
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,088
<font color=#FFFF00>May you spend...</font>

61
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,018
<font color=#FFFF00>the rest of your life well.</font>

62
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:00,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

63
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:17,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Yoon Mal Ja.</font>

64
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:20,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Please accompany us to the station.</font>

65
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:21,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up.</font>

66
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:23,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

67
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:25,348
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's going on?
- Ms. Yoon Mal Ja.</font>

68
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:26,947
<font color=#FFFF00>You're charged with illegal practice,</font>

69
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,247
<font color=#FFFF00>issuance of false diagnoses,</font>

70
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:32,148
<font color=#FFFF00>unlawful rebate, and illegal
sale of medication.</font>

71
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,618
<font color=#FFFF00>You need to come to the station with us.</font>

72
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:38,188
<font color=#FFFF00>You have the right to remain
silent and to consult an attorney.</font>

73
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:41,394
<font color=#FFFF00>Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.</font>

74
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:42,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

75
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:45,588
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It's not me.</font>

76
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,218
<font color=#FFFF00>No. It's not me.</font>

77
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:53,034
<font color=#FFFF00>- I didn't do it.
- Get in.</font>

78
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:54,388
<font color=#FFFF00>- No!
- Let's go.</font>

79
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:57,317
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. What happened to Doctor Yoon?</font>

80
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:59,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not sure. I wonder what it's about.</font>

81
00:04:59,418 --> 00:05:02,348
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did she do wrong?
- Exactly.</font>

82
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:04,348
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's happening?
- What a mess.</font>

83
00:05:04,558 --> 00:05:05,587
<font color=#FFFF00>(Han Seong Sik's candidacy is confirmed.)</font>

84
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:08,218
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you feel as you have
officially entered into politics?</font>

85
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I was too excited to get any sleep.</font>

86
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm honored to contribute...</font>

87
00:05:17,218 --> 00:05:18,618
<font color=#FFFF00>in making the world a better place.</font>

88
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:23,534
<font color=#FFFF00>Please say a few words before we wrap up.</font>

89
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:24,588
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all,</font>

90
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:27,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I would like to show my gratitude to...</font>

91
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,718
<font color=#FFFF00>the members of my party who trust in me.</font>

92
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:32,848
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on,</font>

93
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:37,424
<font color=#FFFF00>my dear and respectful citizens,</font>

94
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:38,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I leave it to you.</font>

95
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,517
<font color=#FFFF00>I am the candidate of a dignity and...</font>

96
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,818
<font color=#FFFF00>a noble standard which you deserve to have.</font>

97
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:48,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I can assure you, I am the
only reliable candidate.</font>

98
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:51,448
<font color=#FFFF00>All you need to do is enjoy
the fruit of my labor.</font>

99
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:55,118
<font color=#FFFF00>I, Han Seong Sik, will do all the work</font>

100
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:03,517
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I am Han Seong Sik.</font>

101
00:06:03,518 --> 00:06:04,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi.</font>

102
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:06,224
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you announce your candidacy?</font>

103
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,988
<font color=#FFFF00>You're working hard in this cold weather.</font>

104
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:12,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I am Han Seong Sik who
will save Korean politics.</font>

105
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:13,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Ma'am.</font>

106
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,587
<font color=#FFFF00>I am the handsome lawyer, Han Seong Sik.</font>

107
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:20,118
<font color=#FFFF00>The carrots look very fresh.</font>

108
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:22,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

109
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,388
<font color=#FFFF00>I am Han Seong Sik from Minjeong Party.</font>

110
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is that?</font>

111
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:31,324
<font color=#FFFF00>- Isn't it my dear Seong Sik?
- I am Han Seong Sik who...</font>

112
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,288
<font color=#FFFF00>- will save Korean politics.
- Why is he on TV?</font>

113
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:36,694
<font color=#FFFF00>That is him.</font>

114
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:38,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he saying hello to people?</font>

115
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,217
<font color=#FFFF00>He went to the market.</font>

116
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he go?</font>

117
00:06:43,148 --> 00:06:45,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Did his mother want him
to go grocery shopping?</font>

118
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think so.</font>

119
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:52,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Why would you eat that
without cleaning it first?</font>

120
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:54,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Is your grandson running for...</font>

121
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,617
<font color=#FFFF00>a seat in the National Assembly?</font>

122
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:58,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

123
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:00,948
<font color=#FFFF00>A seat in the National Assembly?</font>

124
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:05,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Ae. Hyung Seop.</font>

125
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,238
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Seong Sik mention that
he was running for office?</font>

126
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:14,388
<font color=#FFFF00>No one's here.</font>

127
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did everyone go?</font>

128
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:20,347
<font color=#FFFF00>I always forget at least something
when I go grocery shopping.</font>

129
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:21,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Last time,</font>

130
00:07:21,848 --> 00:07:24,924
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgot to buy this spring onion.</font>

131
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,247
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the same, Mother.</font>

132
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:29,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgot to buy spinach I was
going to cook for the children.</font>

133
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I should buy some more
dried laver and shrimp sauce.</font>

134
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,817
<font color=#FFFF00>I will buy some snacks...</font>

135
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:38,948
<font color=#FFFF00>and oatmeal for the children.</font>

136
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:41,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure?</font>

137
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:43,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

138
00:07:44,648 --> 00:07:48,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, I think that's a good idea.
Buy more. I will, too.</font>

139
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Mother.</font>

140
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:58,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so glad that I can come
shopping with you often like this.</font>

141
00:07:58,518 --> 00:07:59,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Same here.</font>

142
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,624
<font color=#FFFF00>How much is it?</font>

143
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,848
<font color=#FFFF00>It's 80 dollars.</font>

144
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:20,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it 80 dollars?</font>

145
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:22,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait a second.</font>

146
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. No way.</font>

147
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:33,017
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong, Mother?
- I forgot my wallet today.</font>

148
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously.</font>

149
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:39,387
<font color=#FFFF00>This is unbelievable.</font>

150
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry. Please wait a moment.</font>

151
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:43,658
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not in here.</font>

152
00:08:44,488 --> 00:08:46,494
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, I need you...</font>

153
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,248
<font color=#FFFF00>to pay for mine today.</font>

154
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:52,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, this isn't good.</font>

155
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,048
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

156
00:08:54,488 --> 00:08:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I forgot to bring my wallet...</font>

157
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,818
<font color=#FFFF00>again today.</font>

158
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,658
<font color=#FFFF00>Dear me.</font>

159
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:05,318
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

160
00:09:13,188 --> 00:09:15,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize, Mother.</font>

161
00:09:17,548 --> 00:09:19,788
<font color=#FFFF00>What's gotten into you?
You're not as old as I am.</font>

162
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you forget
your wallet so many times.</font>

163
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:26,164
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, actually, I used this same bag...</font>

164
00:09:26,188 --> 00:09:28,664
<font color=#FFFF00>the other day I came here with you,</font>

165
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,969
<font color=#FFFF00>and I forgot to put my wallet
in here in the first place.</font>

166
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:34,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've remembered to bring it today.</font>

167
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,788
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm so sorry.
- Goodness.</font>

168
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, Father is here.</font>

169
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, we are here!</font>

170
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:47,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

171
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here? I called
Seong Sik, not you.</font>

172
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:55,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, I called Father.</font>

173
00:09:56,618 --> 00:09:58,718
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry.
- Why did you do that?</font>

174
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:02,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on. You know Seong Sik
is too busy to come here.</font>

175
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,658
<font color=#FFFF00>This is ridiculous.</font>

176
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,748
<font color=#FFFF00>It's 160 dollars in total.</font>

177
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:16,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I will pay it with this.</font>

178
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:31,548
<font color=#FFFF00>This is total nonsense.
Why did you pay for all?</font>

179
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:35,864
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I tell Hee Sook
to pay hers herself?</font>

180
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:39,248
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't her first time
making me pay for her.</font>

181
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,188
<font color=#FFFF00>It doesn't really matter.</font>

182
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:44,788
<font color=#FFFF00>How could a parent neglect
her in such situation?</font>

183
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:47,248
<font color=#FFFF00>And you know she forgot her wallet today.</font>

184
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:50,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm saying she does this all the time.</font>

185
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:55,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be too mean to her.
She's your daughter-in-law.</font>

186
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,764
<font color=#FFFF00>This is ridiculous.</font>

187
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,394
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't stand this anymore!
- You two are back.</font>

188
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:03,364
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom, you're here.
- Mother, Hee Sook ripped me off...</font>

189
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:05,988
<font color=#FFFF00>again at the market again today.</font>

190
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:08,317
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

191
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you Hee Sook is too
clever for you to deal with.</font>

192
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:15,264
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother...
- Please be quiet. By the way,</font>

193
00:11:15,288 --> 00:11:18,418
<font color=#FFFF00>is Seong Sik really going to run for
the National Assembly this year?</font>

194
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

195
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,688
<font color=#FFFF00>I just saw it...</font>

196
00:11:23,188 --> 00:11:27,088
<font color=#FFFF00>on television earlier, so I thought
you two already are aware of this.</font>

197
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:30,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik runs for the National
Assembly by-elections.</font>

198
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:34,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry? By-elections?</font>

199
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:38,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Dad. I also saw it on television.</font>

200
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:41,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What's gotten into him?</font>

201
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Politics isn't something
that anyone can do.</font>

202
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:47,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, don't worry too much.</font>

203
00:11:47,418 --> 00:11:50,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll visit his office right
away and talk to him.</font>

204
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:53,288
<font color=#FFFF00>It might ruin our whole family.</font>

205
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell him to give up now.</font>

206
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I will. I'll call you later.</font>

207
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Seriously.</font>

208
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:09,988
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with him?</font>

209
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:13,648
<font color=#FFFF00>(Han Seong Sik, Minjeong
Party's official candidate)</font>

210
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

211
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:20,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

212
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,048
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do?</font>

213
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I need you to resolve it.</font>

214
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:36,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon, did you talk to Seong Sik?</font>

215
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:39,887
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I told you we'd meet again.</font>

216
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:42,517
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come here?</font>

217
00:12:42,518 --> 00:12:44,218
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad.
- Get up already.</font>

218
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,718
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think you're doing?
- Dad.</font>

219
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of this.</font>

220
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:51,818
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get out of here.
- Goodness.</font>

221
00:12:52,788 --> 00:12:54,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

222
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever come back again.</font>

223
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,618
<font color=#FFFF00>If you come here again,
I'll call the police.</font>

224
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:02,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure. Go ahead.</font>

225
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,888
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe you just said that.</font>

226
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Get lost now.</font>

227
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:09,688
<font color=#FFFF00>I will leave now,</font>

228
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,518
<font color=#FFFF00>but I'm coming back.</font>

229
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:15,988
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make sure to come back soon.
Wait for me.</font>

230
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:20,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What a wench.</font>

231
00:13:23,318 --> 00:13:24,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

232
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad,</font>

233
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,348
<font color=#FFFF00>you need to tell me so that I can help you.</font>

234
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm afraid to tell you...</font>

235
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:49,818
<font color=#FFFF00>that I don't want anything that
breaks Mom's heart to happen again.</font>

236
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:55,788
<font color=#FFFF00>If she's Seong Joon's biological mother,</font>

237
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,888
<font color=#FFFF00>please just give her what she
wants and let her walk away...</font>

238
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:02,718
<font color=#FFFF00>for Mom's sake.</font>

239
00:14:04,988 --> 00:14:07,147
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't just keep sighing.</font>

240
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:09,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom shouldn't find this out.</font>

241
00:14:10,418 --> 00:14:13,518
<font color=#FFFF00>It took 10 years for her to
accept Seong Joon as her son.</font>

242
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:17,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon came to us when he was seven,</font>

243
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:20,118
<font color=#FFFF00>and she first hugged him when he turned 17.</font>

244
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- This will perturb her again.
- Seong Hoon.</font>

245
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:28,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Dad.</font>

246
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you just help me...</font>

247
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,418
<font color=#FFFF00>without asking anything?</font>

248
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:50,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo!</font>

249
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here?</font>

250
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:58,348
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you come back?
Will you stay here, then?</font>

251
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:03,148
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't come back because
you forgot something, right?</font>

252
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:06,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll stay here forever, won't you?</font>

253
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm so glad you are back.</font>

254
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:16,888
<font color=#FFFF00>I also have good news.</font>

255
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:20,848
<font color=#FFFF00>My dad is back. He said
he'll live in Korea.</font>

256
00:15:26,888 --> 00:15:29,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I returned to take care of a few things.</font>

257
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:32,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I will leave again soon. Please go.</font>

258
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

259
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:38,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's the matter?
- I need you to leave now.</font>

260
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing will change even if
I came back permanently.</font>

261
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:44,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Now leave.</font>

262
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on.</font>

263
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,288
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did something happen to you?
- Nothing happened.</font>

264
00:15:53,288 --> 00:15:54,688
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not together anymore.</font>

265
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:58,017
<font color=#FFFF00>You also said we are finished...</font>

266
00:15:58,018 --> 00:15:59,858
<font color=#FFFF00>and you'll blame me for
the rest of your life.</font>

267
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:02,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Do as you said.</font>

268
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:04,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't try to find me.</font>

269
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:10,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

270
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Mr. Lee. How are you?</font>

271
00:16:35,948 --> 00:16:37,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello.
- Why don't you go inside?</font>

272
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:43,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodbye.</font>

273
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:51,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out. Leave already.</font>

274
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,148
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, Mr. Kim.</font>

275
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you joking with me? Do you
think anyone can be a writer?</font>

276
00:16:57,618 --> 00:17:00,018
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm sorry.
- Dong Hui,</font>

277
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:02,018
<font color=#FFFF00>sorry doesn't cut it.</font>

278
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,294
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know we had to do extra
work while you were away?</font>

279
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,547
<font color=#FFFF00>I made coffee for others and
even had to clean the office.</font>

280
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:11,288
<font color=#FFFF00>That's enough, everyone.
She's here after all.</font>

281
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:14,187
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good you mentioned it.
Why are you back?</font>

282
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,464
<font color=#FFFF00>We've already suffered
enough because of you.</font>

283
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:18,988
<font color=#FFFF00>- Well...
- What's going on here?</font>

284
00:17:19,888 --> 00:17:21,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning, Director Bang.</font>

285
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:23,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here, Dong Hui?</font>

286
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is she?</font>

287
00:17:27,358 --> 00:17:29,394
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me introduce her to you.</font>

288
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:31,088
<font color=#FFFF00>You know Writer Choi Jin Kyung, right?</font>

289
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:32,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

290
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,287
<font color=#FFFF00>She wrote a miniseries called,</font>

291
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,688
<font color=#FFFF00>"Icarus's Wings: the Golden Times".</font>

292
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:39,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. I'm Choi Jin Kyung.</font>

293
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Director Han? We have
to sign a contract today.</font>

294
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:50,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. Please say hello.
This is Writer Choi Jin Kyung.</font>

295
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:54,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director Han. I've
heard a lot about you.</font>

296
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry,</font>

297
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:09,608
<font color=#FFFF00>but I was aware that I was to
write the scripts on my own.</font>

298
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:13,418
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about the same as writing
the scripts on your own.</font>

299
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:15,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui wrote the synopsis.</font>

300
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,217
<font color=#FFFF00>We scouted you for a writer...</font>

301
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:20,147
<font color=#FFFF00>who will write even better scripts.</font>

302
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you wouldn't be offended.</font>

303
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:24,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I never agreed to sell my synopsis.</font>

304
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:28,358
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you telling me that you will
write the scripts all on your own?</font>

305
00:18:28,948 --> 00:18:30,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

306
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:31,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, what is your plan?</font>

307
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:35,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi, please help us.</font>

308
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:37,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Producer Park insists on
directing this drama.</font>

309
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:40,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't depend on Ms. Oh Dong Hui
since she's an inexperienced writer.</font>

310
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,918
<font color=#FFFF00>We have no other way around it.</font>

311
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,917
<font color=#FFFF00>So do you mean that I have to co-write...</font>

312
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,688
<font color=#FFFF00>with a rookie like her?</font>

313
00:18:48,948 --> 00:18:52,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I also do not wish to co-write
my drama with another writer.</font>

314
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:53,788
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

315
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:56,858
<font color=#FFFF00>How old are you? How many
dramas have you written?</font>

316
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,857
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang. How can you
handle business like this?</font>

317
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:01,618
<font color=#FFFF00>This is also an insult to Writer Choi, too.</font>

318
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. Then, I will make a
suggestion to both of you.</font>

319
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:09,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi, if you help us out this time,</font>

320
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,288
<font color=#FFFF00>we will sign you for the next drama.</font>

321
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,018
<font color=#FFFF00>And for you, Ms. Oh Dong Hui.</font>

322
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:17,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you won't sell your synopsis,</font>

323
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll treat you like a writer, then.</font>

324
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:24,548
<font color=#FFFF00>However, it will only air after you
have proved yourself as a writer.</font>

325
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:26,518
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

326
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:29,748
<font color=#FFFF00>We will go ahead with her synopsis,</font>

327
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,688
<font color=#FFFF00>but both of you will write the
scripts based on the synopsis.</font>

328
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:36,294
<font color=#FFFF00>We will go with the scripts
that seem to be written better.</font>

329
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:37,358
<font color=#FFFF00>How can that be possible?</font>

330
00:19:37,588 --> 00:19:39,287
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang. Is this how you handle...</font>

331
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:41,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I am aware that I may be
asking a bit much from you.</font>

332
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,217
<font color=#FFFF00>However, don't worry since a
rookie writer like her...</font>

333
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,648
<font color=#FFFF00>can't defeat you.</font>

334
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:50,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Now the decision remains
solely on your hands.</font>

335
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:53,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh Dong Hui.</font>

336
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:56,417
<font color=#FFFF00>This is a good way for you to
squash any rumor that claims...</font>

337
00:19:56,418 --> 00:19:59,618
<font color=#FFFF00>you became a writer by someone's
help, not by your own merit.</font>

338
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:09,218
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think? Are you not confident?</font>

339
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:12,948
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are not, then stay out of it.</font>

340
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:26,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you willingly
accept her suggestion?</font>

341
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:28,864
<font color=#FFFF00>If not?</font>

342
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:31,418
<font color=#FFFF00>She might think I'm running
away because I'm scared.</font>

343
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,518
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have protected your synopsis.</font>

344
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:37,394
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you compete with another
writer with a synopsis you wrote?</font>

345
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:40,018
<font color=#FFFF00>If I don't, she won't
acknowledge me as a writer.</font>

346
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,294
<font color=#FFFF00>If I say I will write
the scripts on my own,</font>

347
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,648
<font color=#FFFF00>do you think she would approve?</font>

348
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:46,518
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right, but...</font>

349
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,088
<font color=#FFFF00>This is just too sad.</font>

350
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,078
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't do anything about it even if it is.</font>

351
00:20:51,248 --> 00:20:52,858
<font color=#FFFF00>All I can do is win.</font>

352
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:54,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

353
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:57,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave now. I'm going
to start right away.</font>

354
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:28,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think this is some
sort of a game or a trick?</font>

355
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,288
<font color=#FFFF00>How can two writers
compete with each other?</font>

356
00:21:30,388 --> 00:21:32,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Did I hurt your feelings?</font>

357
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:35,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Drama is like a living creature.</font>

358
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:37,194
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hard enough for one writer
to come up with the scripts.</font>

359
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:39,148
<font color=#FFFF00>How can they alternate episodes and write?</font>

360
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Who said they will alternate
episodes and write?</font>

361
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:43,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. You are confident.</font>

362
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:45,948
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

363
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:48,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi has an experience
of 10 years in scriptwriting.</font>

364
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,217
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think Dong Hui can
write better than...</font>

365
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi even if it's just one episode?</font>

366
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Mi Joo!</font>

367
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,794
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether Writer Choi wins or she does,</font>

368
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:00,518
<font color=#FFFF00>it won't hurt our team in any
way since we will be airing...</font>

369
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,418
<font color=#FFFF00>the episodes of better written scripts.</font>

370
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that enough?</font>

371
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry too much.</font>

372
00:22:08,248 --> 00:22:10,888
<font color=#FFFF00>You said she is a good writer.</font>

373
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:12,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, she will win.</font>

374
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,964
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, you usually turn off
your phone when you go home.</font>

375
00:22:16,988 --> 00:22:19,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm grateful that you're calling me now.</font>

376
00:22:20,948 --> 00:22:23,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, then. Good night. Bye now.</font>

377
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, be quiet. Don't
you know I'm writing now?</font>

378
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,418
<font color=#FFFF00>This is very important to me.
I have to win.</font>

379
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:51,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet!</font>

380
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:03,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going somewhere?</font>

381
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:06,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I have to meet someone.</font>

382
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,338
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you meeting at this late hour?</font>

383
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm meeting a coworker.</font>

384
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:12,487
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be back.</font>

385
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:13,747
<font color=#FFFF00>Come home early.</font>

386
00:23:13,748 --> 00:23:14,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

387
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:21,948
<font color=#FFFF00>How's Father?</font>

388
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I saw him at home before I left.</font>

389
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:27,118
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

390
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:30,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I have to keep
this a secret from him?</font>

391
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:35,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

392
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to bring this to you.</font>

393
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Father is in trouble.</font>

394
00:23:44,218 --> 00:23:45,288
<font color=#FFFF00>What kind of trouble?</font>

395
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:48,118
<font color=#FFFF00>He won't tell me what it is.</font>

396
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:52,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You know the woman with Father you
saw on the street the other day?</font>

397
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:57,947
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me. I can't help you anymore.</font>

398
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Go. Leave now.</font>

399
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,248
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be Seong Joon.</font>

400
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:03,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know who I am?</font>

401
00:24:04,648 --> 00:24:06,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I remember her. What about it?</font>

402
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,588
<font color=#FFFF00>We shouldn't...</font>

403
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,088
<font color=#FFFF00>mention at home that we met her, okay?</font>

404
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:14,588
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

405
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I just called you just to make
sure you won't make any mistake.</font>

406
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,088
<font color=#FFFF00>We didn't see anything.</font>

407
00:24:20,748 --> 00:24:23,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's be careful so that we
won't make any mistake at home.</font>

408
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:24,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

409
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:26,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is she?</font>

410
00:24:26,888 --> 00:24:30,187
<font color=#FFFF00>I think she is an old coworker of Father.</font>

411
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

412
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:33,388
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not clueless.</font>

413
00:24:35,948 --> 00:24:37,148
<font color=#FFFF00>One day,</font>

414
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:40,348
<font color=#FFFF00>when Mother brought up about marriage,</font>

415
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:45,348
<font color=#FFFF00>she asked me if I looked
for my biological mother.</font>

416
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:48,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

417
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:50,488
<font color=#FFFF00>By any chance,</font>

418
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:53,248
<font color=#FFFF00>is she my biological mother?</font>

419
00:24:54,418 --> 00:24:56,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know, but...</font>

420
00:24:56,748 --> 00:24:57,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

421
00:24:58,048 --> 00:24:59,488
<font color=#FFFF00>You are worried about Mother, right?</font>

422
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:01,588
<font color=#FFFF00>You are worried she might be hurt again.</font>

423
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:05,517
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Joon.
- If you know her phone number,</font>

424
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:06,588
<font color=#FFFF00>please let me have it.</font>

425
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,364
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

426
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:10,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me have her phone number.</font>

427
00:25:28,618 --> 00:25:29,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you doing your best?</font>

428
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:31,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

429
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:33,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I am doing my best.</font>

430
00:25:36,848 --> 00:25:37,948
<font color=#FFFF00>How about you, Ah In?</font>

431
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,348
<font color=#FFFF00>I am almost done.</font>

432
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:42,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Excellent. After we finish all of it,</font>

433
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:46,788
<font color=#FFFF00>I will give you a ride to
your school and preschool.</font>

434
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:49,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to take the bus.</font>

435
00:25:49,888 --> 00:25:50,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

436
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:53,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Han Ji Hoon.</font>

437
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,488
<font color=#FFFF00>What did I tell you?</font>

438
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Once a son, always a son!</font>

439
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:01,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you forget that?</font>

440
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:10,918
<font color=#FFFF00>You might be better off just taking
the ride when I tell you nicely.</font>

441
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

442
00:26:23,288 --> 00:26:27,248
<font color=#FFFF00>It is quite comfortable since she
took all the children with her.</font>

443
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:32,218
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a plenty of time in the morning.</font>

444
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:35,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Just because you took them away from me,</font>

445
00:26:35,918 --> 00:26:37,617
<font color=#FFFF00>doesn't mean they are yours.</font>

446
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:39,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Do your best, Kang Hee Sook.</font>

447
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:42,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Fulfill your wish.</font>

448
00:26:49,518 --> 00:26:53,888
<font color=#FFFF00>It's never quiet because of
Hee Sook and her husband.</font>

449
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides,</font>

450
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:59,788
<font color=#FFFF00>you, Han Seong Sik. You are
going to be a politician?</font>

451
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,788
<font color=#FFFF00>You are running for a seat
in the National Assembly?</font>

452
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,324
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to put your life
on the line for the citizens?</font>

453
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:07,418
<font color=#FFFF00>That is enough to make a cat laugh.</font>

454
00:27:08,688 --> 00:27:11,147
<font color=#FFFF00>You were chasing after pretty girls...</font>

455
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:13,518
<font color=#FFFF00>while using the protest as an excuse.</font>

456
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:15,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you trying to kid?</font>

457
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,247
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can't.
- Grandmother.</font>

458
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:20,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think anyone can be a politician?</font>

459
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,417
<font color=#FFFF00>I've witnessed many people...</font>

460
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:24,894
<font color=#FFFF00>who destroyed their families
because they got into politics.</font>

461
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:27,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, that's a very
negative opinion of your grandson.</font>

462
00:27:27,618 --> 00:27:30,347
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not a negative opinion of you.</font>

463
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,464
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm basing this on my
experience and the statistics.</font>

464
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:36,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to proud of
me if I become a congressman?</font>

465
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:39,018
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be so proud and happy,</font>

466
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:42,164
<font color=#FFFF00>but you might ruin your life over that.</font>

467
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:45,418
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just don't do it.
- Dad!</font>

468
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:48,387
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree with your dad and grandmother.</font>

469
00:27:48,388 --> 00:27:49,964
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't really know it well,</font>

470
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:52,847
<font color=#FFFF00>but I know it costs a lot of
money to become a politician.</font>

471
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:53,917
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom!</font>

472
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:55,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you stopping me because of money?</font>

473
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:59,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you worried that I
might ask you for money?</font>

474
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:01,188
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hey.
- Stay quiet, Seong Hoon!</font>

475
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,147
<font color=#FFFF00>You've used up all our family's money.</font>

476
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:06,417
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Mom and Dad
are stopping me from...</font>

477
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,548
<font color=#FFFF00>entering the election! They think
I might ask them for money.</font>

478
00:28:08,648 --> 00:28:12,148
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say?
- Goodness. That fool.</font>

479
00:28:12,418 --> 00:28:15,864
<font color=#FFFF00>Just stick to your job as a lawyer.</font>

480
00:28:15,888 --> 00:28:17,364
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter with you?</font>

481
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,924
<font color=#FFFF00>A man should be ambitious and dream big.</font>

482
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Why should I settle for
running my own business?</font>

483
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:26,488
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Being a lawyer is just a business.</font>

484
00:28:26,648 --> 00:28:31,194
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to go into the bigger
world, Mom, Dad, and Grandmother!</font>

485
00:28:31,218 --> 00:28:35,388
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. You've gone totally insane.</font>

486
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:37,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Get up. You and I should talk.</font>

487
00:28:37,688 --> 00:28:39,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing?</font>

488
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,487
<font color=#FFFF00>- Get up, you brat.
- Gosh. Mom! Dad!</font>

489
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother! Help me!</font>

490
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:48,718
<font color=#FFFF00>- Let me go. What are you doing?
- It's never peaceful in this house.</font>

491
00:28:50,788 --> 00:28:53,048
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop it! Let me go!
- My goodness, you punk.</font>

492
00:28:53,288 --> 00:28:54,788
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

493
00:28:55,548 --> 00:28:56,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't I warn you?</font>

494
00:28:57,388 --> 00:28:59,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to be careful with
Minjeong Party and Seonghan Group,</font>

495
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,888
<font color=#FFFF00>but you've joined that party. Now
you want to run for the election.</font>

496
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:07,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Who's backing you up?</font>

497
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:11,118
<font color=#FFFF00>- Who's sponsoring you?
- Don't you know that?</font>

498
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,317
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Kim Young Tae is backing me up,</font>

499
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:15,798
<font color=#FFFF00>and Seonghan Group is sponsoring me.
What are you going to do?</font>

500
00:29:16,218 --> 00:29:20,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you worry. I won't ask
our family even for a penny.</font>

501
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:24,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Whether you get help from our
family or not isn't the issue here.</font>

502
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:26,148
<font color=#FFFF00>You're going to be in big trouble!</font>

503
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:28,708
<font color=#FFFF00>If something happens during
the election period,</font>

504
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,388
<font color=#FFFF00>you will totally lose your
social standing in this society.</font>

505
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:35,218
<font color=#FFFF00>You might lose your license, let
alone losing all the TV shows.</font>

506
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:37,064
<font color=#FFFF00>The way I see it, your
life is in bigger trouble.</font>

507
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,547
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to keep
selling fried chickens...</font>

508
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:40,848
<font color=#FFFF00>until you become an old man?</font>

509
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:43,887
<font color=#FFFF00>When you and Hye Joo become an old couple,</font>

510
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:46,528
<font color=#FFFF00>your children might look down on
you saying you're old and smelly.</font>

511
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:49,564
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say?
- Just stay quiet.</font>

512
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:50,848
<font color=#FFFF00>If you do,</font>

513
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:54,218
<font color=#FFFF00>I might hire you as my spokesperson later.</font>

514
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:57,848
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Sik.
- Let go of me.</font>

515
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me go. My goodness.</font>

516
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik.</font>

517
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:03,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik!</font>

518
00:30:06,088 --> 00:30:07,248
<font color=#FFFF00>That brat.</font>

519
00:30:08,518 --> 00:30:09,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

520
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:13,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Please deliver it today, then.</font>

521
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. All right.</font>

522
00:30:17,018 --> 00:30:19,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. What are you doing?</font>

523
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:24,288
<font color=#FFFF00>What? I just dropped the
kids off at school.</font>

524
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:26,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. This is driving me crazy.</font>

525
00:30:27,788 --> 00:30:30,387
<font color=#FFFF00>Although I'm grateful that
you drop my children off...</font>

526
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,188
<font color=#FFFF00>at school and pick them up every day,</font>

527
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:34,788
<font color=#FFFF00>- isn't that tiring?
- It's not.</font>

528
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:38,464
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go out to buy
collections of German songs...</font>

529
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:40,688
<font color=#FFFF00>and Italian songs for Chang
Soo later in the afternoon.</font>

530
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,248
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a natural. You have talents for it.</font>

531
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:48,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't pick a fight with me.
Just go to work.</font>

532
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook.</font>

533
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Pay more attention to your husband.</font>

534
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:55,418
<font color=#FFFF00>He wants to be a politician.
What are you going to do now?</font>

535
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:58,518
<font color=#FFFF00>There is nothing to do. He's not
going to be elected anyway.</font>

536
00:30:59,718 --> 00:31:02,148
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not interested in your
husband at all, are you?</font>

537
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:06,648
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not interested in a grown-up.</font>

538
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,548
<font color=#FFFF00>The ones I'm interested in...</font>

539
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:14,018
<font color=#FFFF00>are growing children. I have
no interests for others.</font>

540
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,988
<font color=#FFFF00>It's good that I ran into you. Hye Joo.</font>

541
00:31:20,718 --> 00:31:23,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I think you should move
this chest of yours.</font>

542
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,818
<font color=#FFFF00>- Why?
- Just move it.</font>

543
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,388
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't ask me to do that.</font>

544
00:31:30,248 --> 00:31:33,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you this is what my parents left me.</font>

545
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:35,888
<font color=#FFFF00>No. Absolutely not.</font>

546
00:31:36,418 --> 00:31:38,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Besides, we moved downstairs
on the condition that...</font>

547
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,718
<font color=#FFFF00>I can place this here. Have you forgotten?</font>

548
00:31:40,918 --> 00:31:42,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Just move it.</font>

549
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:45,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I bought a piano for Chang
Soo, and it's coming today.</font>

550
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:48,618
<font color=#FFFF00>- A piano?
- Yes.</font>

551
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you want...</font>

552
00:31:52,218 --> 00:31:55,288
<font color=#FFFF00>to raise Chang Soo to a
world-class opera singer?</font>

553
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:02,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I speak</font>

554
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:06,918
<font color=#FFFF00>With trembling lips</font>

555
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:09,588
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor</font>

556
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:13,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Words of confession</font>

557
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:18,694
<font color=#FFFF00>My shy</font>

558
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:22,418
<font color=#FFFF00>And bashful face</font>

559
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:27,188
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel</font>

560
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:29,418
<font color=#FFFF00>My heart fluttering</font>

561
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:35,647
<font color=#FFFF00>I take courage</font>

562
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Hidden deep in my heart</font>

563
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:41,088
<font color=#FFFF00>I speak</font>

564
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:46,048
<font color=#FFFF00>My poor words of confession</font>

565
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,288
<font color=#FFFF00>He must be crazy.</font>

566
00:33:51,318 --> 00:33:53,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does he want to meet me now?</font>

567
00:33:58,018 --> 00:34:01,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I will see him and have
it out with him today.</font>

568
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:05,648
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk. He's a total jerk.</font>

569
00:34:07,018 --> 00:34:09,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Why does he want to see me after 30 years?</font>

570
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:26,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a dead man.</font>

571
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:11,988
<font color=#FFFF00>You're as tall as ever.</font>

572
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:16,288
<font color=#FFFF00>- You're as short as ever.
- How have you been?</font>

573
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that how you want to
greet me in 30 years?</font>

574
00:35:20,848 --> 00:35:22,948
<font color=#FFFF00>You're still beautiful.</font>

575
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:24,888
<font color=#FFFF00>You look so pretty.</font>

576
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Please don't wear high heels...</font>

577
00:35:28,848 --> 00:35:30,948
<font color=#FFFF00>next time we see each other.</font>

578
00:35:32,018 --> 00:35:34,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Next time? Gosh, I can't believe this.</font>

579
00:35:35,288 --> 00:35:38,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would I see you again? Are you insane?</font>

580
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:42,124
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me carefully. The
reason why I came here today...</font>

581
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:44,388
<font color=#FFFF00>is not because I missed you...</font>

582
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,788
<font color=#FFFF00>or because I wanted to see how you changed.</font>

583
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:48,848
<font color=#FFFF00>During the past 30 years,</font>

584
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,117
<font color=#FFFF00>I always wanted to know how you were.</font>

585
00:35:52,118 --> 00:35:55,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Not me. I never wanted
to know how you were.</font>

586
00:35:55,548 --> 00:35:58,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Since the day you left for Italy,</font>

587
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:00,394
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never thought about you.</font>

588
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:02,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never even dreamed about you.</font>

589
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,388
<font color=#FFFF00>So from this moment on,</font>

590
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:06,818
<font color=#FFFF00>don't ever call me.</font>

591
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:11,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't show up in front of me.
Just stay out of my sight.</font>

592
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:13,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I came to say this.</font>

593
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:15,647
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's clear up the misunderstanding.</font>

594
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:18,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Misunderstanding? There
is no misunderstanding.</font>

595
00:36:19,118 --> 00:36:21,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I dated you because I was young and stupid,</font>

596
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:24,418
<font color=#FFFF00>and we broke up. That's
the end of the story.</font>

597
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:27,347
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'm a woman who would wait...</font>

598
00:36:27,348 --> 00:36:29,148
<font color=#FFFF00>for a guy to return for 30 years?</font>

599
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:32,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be ridiculous.</font>

600
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

601
00:36:34,488 --> 00:36:37,518
<font color=#FFFF00>No. You don't need to be.
Why are you sorry?</font>

602
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:40,818
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like you hurt me,</font>

603
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:44,588
<font color=#FFFF00>made me waste my time, or humiliated me.</font>

604
00:36:44,888 --> 00:36:47,258
<font color=#FFFF00>I've been just fine. I've been happy.</font>

605
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:49,948
<font color=#FFFF00>My point is...</font>

606
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:52,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you ever...</font>

607
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:55,218
<font color=#FFFF00>show your face again from now on.</font>

608
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,988
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ae Ri.
- If you really...</font>

609
00:36:59,288 --> 00:37:01,688
<font color=#FFFF00>loved me by any chance,</font>

610
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:04,988
<font color=#FFFF00>please do this for me.</font>

611
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:09,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to see you ever again.</font>

612
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:14,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri. Ae Ri.</font>

613
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:15,758
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri.</font>

614
00:37:20,918 --> 00:37:23,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri. Ae Ri!</font>

615
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:06,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Welcome, Director Han.</font>

616
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:13,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

617
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,258
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello. We meet again.</font>

618
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:21,148
<font color=#FFFF00>He came to check the contract himself.</font>

619
00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:26,048
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing? Take a seat.</font>

620
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:34,394
<font color=#FFFF00>I wanted to check the office atmosphere...</font>

621
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:36,988
<font color=#FFFF00>as well as get some things done.</font>

622
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everything going as
planned, Director Han?</font>

623
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:45,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Thanks to you, the
production is running smoothly.</font>

624
00:39:46,388 --> 00:39:49,088
<font color=#FFFF00>We will sign a contract with a writer soon.</font>

625
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:51,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

626
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:54,464
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no doubt...</font>

627
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:56,218
<font color=#FFFF00>that you will handle things well.</font>

628
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,788
<font color=#FFFF00>If this investment turns out as a success,</font>

629
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:01,624
<font color=#FFFF00>I plan to expand the investment...</font>

630
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,148
<font color=#FFFF00>in Korean drama production.</font>

631
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:05,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that right?</font>

632
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:09,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I'd appreciate it
if Director Han is involved.</font>

633
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:11,688
<font color=#FFFF00>This investment will be a success.</font>

634
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:14,948
<font color=#FFFF00>And the next project will
be influenced by it.</font>

635
00:40:15,918 --> 00:40:17,418
<font color=#FFFF00>You've made a right choice.</font>

636
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:21,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I think so, too.</font>

637
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:31,188
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee.</font>

638
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:38,418
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on?</font>

639
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:39,818
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

640
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know why I came here?</font>

641
00:40:42,718 --> 00:40:44,088
<font color=#FFFF00>No, not that.</font>

642
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:48,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I ask you why you decided to come back?</font>

643
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:53,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized...</font>

644
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:56,418
<font color=#FFFF00>that I had unfinished businesses.</font>

645
00:40:56,918 --> 00:40:58,218
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I came back.</font>

646
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:02,918
<font color=#FFFF00>But I don't plan to stay too long.</font>

647
00:41:05,218 --> 00:41:06,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

648
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,448
<font color=#FFFF00>I wish you good luck, Director Han.</font>

649
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,848
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

650
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You're home.</font>

651
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:05,688
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get in here?</font>

652
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:09,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you forget?</font>

653
00:42:09,618 --> 00:42:13,288
<font color=#FFFF00>We used to be a couple. I
know your gate password.</font>

654
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:15,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you came back, so I stopped by.</font>

655
00:42:23,648 --> 00:42:25,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out. Get out now.</font>

656
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:31,418
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've cleaned the house
as soon as you came back.</font>

657
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:33,717
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if you are only
staying for a short while,</font>

658
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,648
<font color=#FFFF00>you should make the house liveable.</font>

659
00:42:37,048 --> 00:42:40,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I got groceries in a hurry, so I
couldn't get too many things.</font>

660
00:42:40,818 --> 00:42:42,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make a few side dishes first.</font>

661
00:42:55,618 --> 00:42:57,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go now. Please.</font>

662
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:00,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

663
00:43:01,258 --> 00:43:03,018
<font color=#FFFF00>help me understand the situation.</font>

664
00:43:03,488 --> 00:43:05,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Or else, I will never be able
to accept this situation.</font>

665
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:07,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me why you suddenly came back.</font>

666
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:10,758
<font color=#FFFF00>It's understandable that
you suddenly came back.</font>

667
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell me why you've changed.</font>

668
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:15,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun.</font>

669
00:43:16,788 --> 00:43:17,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you stupid?</font>

670
00:43:18,258 --> 00:43:19,518
<font color=#FFFF00>We broke up.</font>

671
00:43:19,848 --> 00:43:21,818
<font color=#FFFF00>But you came back.</font>

672
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:23,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What difference does it make?</font>

673
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,218
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

674
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:29,678
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that make any difference
to the fact that we split up?</font>

675
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:32,588
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay for a man and
a woman to split up.</font>

676
00:43:33,288 --> 00:43:36,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you being all clingy because
of your lingering feelings?</font>

677
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:39,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say clingy?</font>

678
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,358
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say lingering feelings?</font>

679
00:43:42,248 --> 00:43:43,388
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

680
00:43:44,048 --> 00:43:46,648
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened to you?</font>

681
00:43:48,718 --> 00:43:50,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

682
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:55,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Please leave...</font>

683
00:43:55,788 --> 00:43:56,948
<font color=#FFFF00>when I ask nicely.</font>

684
00:43:58,188 --> 00:44:00,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't do this. You don't
have to be this mean.</font>

685
00:44:00,948 --> 00:44:02,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Without you,</font>

686
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:05,318
<font color=#FFFF00>a week felt like a year.</font>

687
00:44:05,418 --> 00:44:07,987
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what happened
to you over the week,</font>

688
00:44:07,988 --> 00:44:10,248
<font color=#FFFF00>but you don't have to be like this to me.</font>

689
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:13,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing happened.</font>

690
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,148
<font color=#FFFF00>I just...</font>

691
00:44:16,148 --> 00:44:17,648
<font color=#FFFF00>don't have...</font>

692
00:44:18,418 --> 00:44:20,048
<font color=#FFFF00>a place for you in my heart.</font>

693
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:23,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

694
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:25,748
<font color=#FFFF00>So please leave.</font>

695
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:29,048
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to talk more.</font>

696
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:34,288
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this to me?</font>

697
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:36,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Then...</font>

698
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:39,148
<font color=#FFFF00>what were you doing with me all along?</font>

699
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:41,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Were you playing with me?</font>

700
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:44,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

701
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,218
<font color=#FFFF00>I was playing with you.</font>

702
00:44:48,888 --> 00:44:49,918
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

703
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,988
<font color=#FFFF00>I had a little fun with you.</font>

704
00:44:52,748 --> 00:44:53,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you get it now?</font>

705
00:45:35,248 --> 00:45:36,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you going at this hour?</font>

706
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:39,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going up to the studio.</font>

707
00:45:39,788 --> 00:45:40,888
<font color=#FFFF00>The studio?</font>

708
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:43,988
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you mean Dong Hui's studio?
Why are you going at this hour?</font>

709
00:45:44,248 --> 00:45:45,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

710
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,524
<font color=#FFFF00>How many times did I tell you?</font>

711
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:50,747
<font color=#FFFF00>We are family, but you shouldn't
go up to Dong Hui's room so often.</font>

712
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,648
<font color=#FFFF00>- People will talk about it.
- Mom.</font>

713
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,517
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui's my staff.</font>

714
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,517
<font color=#FFFF00>And she will be writing the
new drama we're producing.</font>

715
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:58,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. I don't know those things.
Just don't go up.</font>

716
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:00,548
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

717
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:13,648
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

718
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:16,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you asleep?</font>

719
00:46:16,618 --> 00:46:17,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you going to write?</font>

720
00:46:21,218 --> 00:46:22,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui?</font>

721
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

722
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:32,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

723
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:39,388
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, what's wrong?</font>

724
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:42,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sick? Is something wrong?</font>

725
00:46:45,148 --> 00:46:46,618
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong?</font>

726
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:49,818
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui!</font>

727
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:56,518
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong? What is it?</font>

728
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I am scared.</font>

729
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:04,487
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I can do this.</font>

730
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,024
<font color=#FFFF00>No matter how much I think about
it, I don't think I can do it.</font>

731
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:09,487
<font color=#FFFF00>I think it's better...</font>

732
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:11,888
<font color=#FFFF00>to ask Writer Choi to write everything.</font>

733
00:47:12,018 --> 00:47:15,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell her she can write the
script using my synopsis.</font>

734
00:47:17,618 --> 00:47:18,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Give me the blanket.</font>

735
00:47:19,188 --> 00:47:21,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared, and I need to put it over me.</font>

736
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:24,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm embarrassed, too.</font>

737
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:27,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui!</font>

738
00:47:29,548 --> 00:47:33,348
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a veteran writer with
10 years of experience,</font>

739
00:47:33,488 --> 00:47:36,718
<font color=#FFFF00>while I'm literally a novice writer.</font>

740
00:47:37,318 --> 00:47:41,588
<font color=#FFFF00>How on earth do you think I can beat her?</font>

741
00:47:42,018 --> 00:47:45,618
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm no match for her in the first place.</font>

742
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:48,418
<font color=#FFFF00>You are very silly, Dong Hui.</font>

743
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:54,088
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. I am silly.</font>

744
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:57,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I know I was too reckless.</font>

745
00:47:58,488 --> 00:48:01,288
<font color=#FFFF00>So please leave me alone.</font>

746
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:20,748
<font color=#FFFF00>- Follow me.
- Sorry?</font>

747
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,418
<font color=#FFFF00>- Where are we going?
- Get up now.</font>

748
00:48:53,788 --> 00:48:56,088
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing now?</font>

749
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:58,688
<font color=#FFFF00>- Just buckle up.
- Pardon?</font>

750
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,588
<font color=#FFFF00>Please tell me where we are going.</font>

751
00:49:10,988 --> 00:49:13,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Are you afraid that I
might sell you to someone?</font>

752
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,318
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't be able to sell you
at a high price, anyway.</font>

753
00:49:17,118 --> 00:49:20,048
<font color=#FFFF00>No one would buy a novice
writer who cries out of fear.</font>

754
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:21,418
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

755
00:49:23,018 --> 00:49:25,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell me where we are heading.</font>

756
00:49:25,218 --> 00:49:28,088
<font color=#FFFF00>- You'll see soon.
- I have no time for this.</font>

757
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:30,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to hand in my
script by this Wednesday.</font>

758
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:34,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you say you gave up and
you'll leave it to Writer Choi?</font>

759
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:36,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet and have some sleep.</font>

760
00:49:52,248 --> 00:49:54,788
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, we're here. Wake up.</font>

761
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are we?</font>

762
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:01,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Just get off.</font>

763
00:50:26,188 --> 00:50:27,348
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't this amazing?</font>

764
00:50:28,018 --> 00:50:30,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know there's
such a place in Korea.</font>

765
00:50:31,818 --> 00:50:33,548
<font color=#FFFF00>I love this smell of books.</font>

766
00:50:35,218 --> 00:50:38,118
<font color=#FFFF00>- These aren't mere books.
- Sorry?</font>

767
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:42,318
<font color=#FFFF00>These are the fruits of the
writers who have overcome...</font>

768
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:43,948
<font color=#FFFF00>dreadful fear of creation.</font>

769
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:56,668
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Ernest Hemingway's.</font>

770
00:50:58,418 --> 00:51:01,118
<font color=#FFFF00>Hemingway once said this.</font>

771
00:51:01,988 --> 00:51:04,888
<font color=#FFFF00>"There is nothing to writing."</font>

772
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:07,488
<font color=#FFFF00>"All you do is..."</font>

773
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,518
<font color=#FFFF00>"sit down at a typewriter and bleed."</font>

774
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,948
<font color=#FFFF00>He rewrote the last part...</font>

775
00:51:14,288 --> 00:51:17,648
<font color=#FFFF00>of "A Farewell to Arms" 39 times.</font>

776
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:46,518
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you like Haruki Murakami?</font>

777
00:51:51,188 --> 00:51:52,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Murakami...</font>

778
00:51:53,288 --> 00:51:56,918
<font color=#FFFF00>gets up at three in the
morning and writes...</font>

779
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,518
<font color=#FFFF00>until noon every day.</font>

780
00:52:00,388 --> 00:52:04,548
<font color=#FFFF00>In the afternoon, he runs...</font>

781
00:52:04,818 --> 00:52:07,118
<font color=#FFFF00>to maintain his good condition for writing.</font>

782
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:13,188
<font color=#FFFF00>How does it feel like to find
out other writers' efforts?</font>

783
00:52:17,488 --> 00:52:19,488
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure no writers wrote their works...</font>

784
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:22,888
<font color=#FFFF00>very easily without any
pain or hardworking.</font>

785
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:28,788
<font color=#FFFF00>All the great writers have gone
through the torment of creativity.</font>

786
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:31,358
<font color=#FFFF00>How would you think you'd
be able to avoid it?</font>

787
00:52:31,918 --> 00:52:34,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you think you could write it overnight?</font>

788
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:37,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I never said that.</font>

789
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:42,888
<font color=#FFFF00>I am afraid. I'm scared to death.</font>

790
00:52:43,218 --> 00:52:45,348
<font color=#FFFF00>What about the writers of all these books?</font>

791
00:52:45,648 --> 00:52:47,188
<font color=#FFFF00>They have felt the same.</font>

792
00:52:48,418 --> 00:52:52,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone is afraid of unknown paths.</font>

793
00:52:52,518 --> 00:52:55,848
<font color=#FFFF00>But if you give up and stop moving forward,</font>

794
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:58,588
<font color=#FFFF00>you'll never be able to find
out the beautiful things...</font>

795
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:00,308
<font color=#FFFF00>waiting for you at the end of the path.</font>

796
00:53:00,888 --> 00:53:02,688
<font color=#FFFF00>All you need to do...</font>

797
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,918
<font color=#FFFF00>is take the first step.</font>

798
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you say you're scared? Everyone is.</font>

799
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:09,948
<font color=#FFFF00>You just have to overcome it.</font>

800
00:53:12,918 --> 00:53:16,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Will I be able to do it?</font>

801
00:53:17,248 --> 00:53:19,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, you will.</font>

802
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What if I fail?</font>

803
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:26,788
<font color=#FFFF00>You just made...</font>

804
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,518
<font color=#FFFF00>what I've said so far meaningless.</font>

805
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:31,717
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm seriously afraid.</font>

806
00:53:31,718 --> 00:53:34,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, give up everything and marry me.</font>

807
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:36,548
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

808
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:41,348
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you talking about?</font>

809
00:53:42,148 --> 00:53:44,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I was going to listen to you as
you said a lot of great things.</font>

810
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,248
<font color=#FFFF00>- And what's this?
- Then, just keep writing.</font>

811
00:53:48,418 --> 00:53:50,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop whining like a baby.</font>

812
00:53:51,048 --> 00:53:55,118
<font color=#FFFF00>You should know so many writers
desperately want to write like you.</font>

813
00:53:55,218 --> 00:53:57,064
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you yelling at me?</font>

814
00:53:57,088 --> 00:53:59,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I do know how to yell just like you.</font>

815
00:54:00,888 --> 00:54:03,848
<font color=#FFFF00>This is ridiculous. You're something else!</font>

816
00:54:04,088 --> 00:54:05,617
<font color=#FFFF00>This is great.</font>

817
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:08,918
<font color=#FFFF00>I was stressed out anyway.
Let's get nasty, then.</font>

818
00:54:09,348 --> 00:54:13,318
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't be able to write a line.
Stop nagging at me.</font>

819
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:17,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you go start writing
and see if it works as you want?</font>

820
00:54:17,848 --> 00:54:20,488
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I'd be here shouting
like this if it was that easy?</font>

821
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:32,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Please...</font>

822
00:54:33,248 --> 00:54:34,588
<font color=#FFFF00>take it easy and keep writing.</font>

823
00:54:35,318 --> 00:54:37,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you can do it. I got your back.</font>

824
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:42,418
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be by your side so
that you won't feel afraid.</font>

825
00:54:43,218 --> 00:54:44,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

826
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:37,418
<font color=#FFFF00>What was that?</font>

827
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,218
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop making excuses and keep writing, okay?</font>

828
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:49,718
<font color=#FFFF00>Come with me. I'll show
you my favorite book.</font>

829
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:57,248
<font color=#FFFF00>"I sat and watched her
sleep, a little troubled,"</font>

830
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:00,318
<font color=#FFFF00>"deep down in my soul,"</font>

831
00:56:00,888 --> 00:56:03,918
<font color=#FFFF00>"but kept holy by the clear night
which has never given me..."</font>

832
00:56:04,648 --> 00:56:06,048
<font color=#FFFF00>"other than beautiful thoughts"</font>

833
00:56:10,888 --> 00:56:13,048

<font color=#FFFF00>"heir silent march,"</font>

835
00:56:16,488 --> 00:56:18,048
<font color=#FFFF00>"obedient as a mighty army."</font>

836
00:56:19,948 --> 00:56:21,388
<font color=#FFFF00>"I fancied that one of these stars,"</font>

837
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:25,018
<font color=#FFFF00>"the most delicate, the most lustrous,"</font>

838
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:27,348
<font color=#FFFF00>"had missed her way..."</font>

839
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:29,388
<font color=#FFFF00>"and had come..."</font>

840
00:56:29,948 --> 00:56:32,348
<font color=#FFFF00>"to lean upon my shoulder, and to sleep."</font>

844
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:41,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

845
00:57:42,188 --> 00:57:43,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, it's me.</font>

846
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,948
<font color=#FFFF00>It's me, Gwang Jin.</font>

847
00:57:52,788 --> 00:57:56,348
<font color=#FFFF00>You sound so surprised, and
I feel bad for calling now.</font>

848
00:57:56,648 --> 00:57:59,288
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. How are you doing?</font>

849
00:57:59,788 --> 00:58:01,318
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you finished the herbal medicine?</font>

850
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:03,948
<font color=#FFFF00>I still have some.</font>

851
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:07,048
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't trouble yourself
with those things now.</font>

852
00:58:07,148 --> 00:58:09,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say that.</font>

853
00:58:11,118 --> 00:58:12,488
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

854
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:17,748
<font color=#FFFF00>I am looking at your
granddaughter Dong Hui's resume.</font>

855
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:20,788
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

856
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:23,218
<font color=#FFFF00>But...</font>

857
00:58:23,788 --> 00:58:25,788
<font color=#FFFF00>she doesn't look anything like you</font>

858
00:58:28,748 --> 00:58:31,518
<font color=#FFFF00>She looks like her father.</font>

859
00:58:31,888 --> 00:58:34,088
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you call to say that?</font>

860
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,848
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course not. I wanted to tell you
that you've brought her up well.</font>

861
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:39,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I see that she's a writer.</font>

862
00:58:41,248 --> 00:58:42,748
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

863
00:58:44,518 --> 00:58:47,188
<font color=#FFFF00>She started out as an
assistant at our office,</font>

864
00:58:48,418 --> 00:58:51,018
<font color=#FFFF00>and now we are signing a
contract with her as a writer.</font>

865
00:58:52,718 --> 00:58:53,888
<font color=#FFFF00>How did it...</font>

866
00:58:55,348 --> 00:58:58,618
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang brought it
to me for a final confirm,</font>

867
00:58:59,088 --> 00:59:00,718
<font color=#FFFF00>and it turned out...</font>

868
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:02,748
<font color=#FFFF00>it was your granddaughter.</font>

869
00:59:03,048 --> 00:59:05,248
<font color=#FFFF00>What a coincidence!</font>

870
00:59:06,388 --> 00:59:08,518
<font color=#FFFF00>She's very pretty, too.</font>

871
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:13,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to meet her first.</font>

872
00:59:15,888 --> 00:59:16,948
<font color=#FFFF00>After that,</font>

873
00:59:17,488 --> 00:59:20,248
<font color=#FFFF00>I will sign the contract with her.</font>

874
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:22,888
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then,</font>

875
00:59:23,248 --> 00:59:24,588

<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

880
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:04,688
<font color=#FFFF00>Is it because of Jeong Eun?</font>

881
01:00:06,248 --> 01:00:07,588
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to talk about it.</font>

882
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:11,748
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've slept well.</font>

883
01:00:15,848 --> 01:00:19,148
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, you will get to...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>Take that...</font>

938
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:34,948
<font color=#FFFF00>and don't bother my dad anymore.</font>

939
01:03:35,618 --> 01:03:37,848
<font color=#FFFF00>I never bothered him.</font>

940

<font color=#FFFF00>Don't show up again.</font>

941
01:03:40,588 --> 01:03:42,888

<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know who I am?</font>

943
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:46,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care.</font>

944

<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

945
01:03:48,218 --> 01:03:49,288
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to...</font>

<font color=#FFFF00>You want to protect your dad.</font>

948
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:58,418
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

01:03:58,818 --> 01:04:02,018

951
01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:08,018
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What did he do to him?</font>

952
01:04:10,148 --> 01:04:11,948
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really not remember anything?</font>

953
01:04:12,218 --> 01:04:14,148
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it that you want to say?</font>

954
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:15,718
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

955
01:04:16,248 --> 01:04:18,048
<font color=#FFFF00>Since you gave me money,</font>

956
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:21,088
<font color=#FFFF00>I will give you a crucial information.</font>

957
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:25,248
<font color=#FFFF00>Your dad...</font>

958
01:04:26,218 --> 01:04:27,948
<font color=#FFFF00>is not your biological dad.</font>

959
01:04:28,648 --> 01:04:31,948
<font color=#FFFF00>He told the orphanage that he
is your biological father.</font>

960
01:04:34,388 --> 01:04:35,518
<font color=#FFFF00>But he is not.</font>

961
01:04:41,348 --> 01:04:43,048
<font color=#FFFF00>He's a silly man.</font>

962
01:04:44,048 --> 01:04:46,118
<font color=#FFFF00>He fooled you completely.</font>

963
01:04:47,848 --> 01:04:51,888
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess you needed to believe that
you were related to one of them.</font>

964
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, you would've
endured your time there.</font>

965
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,048
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

966
01:04:58,418 --> 01:04:59,948
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you saying?</font>

967
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:01,818
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll tell you one more thing.</font>

968
01:05:03,418 --> 01:05:04,718
<font color=#FFFF00>You shouldn't...</font>

969
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:07,048
<font color=#FFFF00>admire your father so much.</font>

970
01:05:07,848 --> 01:05:09,788
<font color=#FFFF00>He's...</font>

971
01:05:11,048 --> 01:05:12,148
<font color=#FFFF00>not so admirable after all.</font>

973

974
01:05:38,988 --> 01:05:40,518
<font color=#FFFF00>I told her to come to the office.</font>

975
01:05:40,888 --> 01:05:42,417
<font color=#FFFF00>So why are they saying...</font>

976
01:05:42,418 --> 01:05:45,117
<font color=#FFFF00>that I provided illegal counsel
to help them evade tax?</font>

977
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:47,117
<font color=#FFFF00>- You are mad!
- Honey!</font>

978
01:05:47,118 --> 01:05:49,218
<font color=#FFFF00>- I am divorcing you.
- Honey!</font>

979
01:05:50,248 --> 01:05:52,288
<font color=#FFFF00>If you don't want to see
Director Han lose his job,</font>

980
01:05:52,388 --> 01:05:54,488
<font color=#FFFF00>you should think carefully.</font>

981
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:55,918
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

982
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:57,988
<font color=#FFFF00>my mother?</font>

983
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:00,748
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything I believed is gone.</font>

984
01:06:00,918 --> 01:06:02,118
<font color=#FFFF00>It's killing me.</font>
