00:00:34,147 --> 00:00:36,987
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, I don't want to go.</font>

4
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,117
<font color="yellow">I can't live with another family.</font>

5
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:43,417
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo, calm down and think about it.</font>

6
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,647
<font color="yellow">It's a good chance for you.</font>

7
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,417
<font color="yellow">What if Sang Woo comes back?</font>

8
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:52,117
<font color="yellow">I should be here when he returns.</font>

9
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:55,817
<font color="yellow">We're looking for Sang Woo with all our might.</font>

10
00:00:55,817 --> 00:00:59,287
<font color="yellow">We'll call your foster parents if we find him.</font>

11
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,317
<font color="yellow">You should adapt well in the U.S...</font>

12
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:04,017
<font color="yellow">so that Sang Woo can move there...</font>

13
00:01:04,187 --> 00:01:06,617
<font color="yellow">when we find him.</font>

14
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:10,487
<font color="yellow">You know there's no way for you to live here...</font>

15
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,687
<font color="yellow">with Sang Woo alone without your parents.</font>

16
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,517
<font color="yellow">I still don't want to leave.</font>

17
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,247
<font color="yellow">I'll just wait for Sang Woo.</font>

18
00:01:58,287 --> 00:01:59,387
<font color="yellow">Are you giving it to me?</font>

19
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,717
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

23
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:16,747

<font color="yellow">You're here, Mr. Lee.</font>

27
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,247
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

28
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:29,957
<font color="yellow">We're so thankful each time.</font>

29
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,047
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it.</font>

30
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:35,547
<font color="yellow">There are many people who do much more than me.</font>

31
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,957
<font color="yellow">Still, we are always thankful.</font>

32
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:43,117
<font color="yellow">The other volunteer brought a lot of snacks.</font>

33
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:44,687
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have some before you go?</font>

34
00:02:45,747 --> 00:02:47,747
<font color="yellow">I'm okay. I have to go now.</font>

35
00:02:48,317 --> 00:02:50,787
<font color="yellow">Please don't refuse it. Please come this way.</font>

36
00:02:51,187 --> 00:02:52,187
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

37
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,147
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

38
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,347
<font color="yellow">You will get cold if you don't dry your hair in the winter.</font>

39
00:03:01,487 --> 00:03:03,117
<font color="yellow">We will eat together after you dry your hair.</font>

40
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:10,187
<font color="yellow">- It's warm. - It's warm, isn't it?</font>

41
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:11,817
<font color="yellow">You're so lovely.</font>

42
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:15,087
<font color="yellow">You guys had a bath. How lovely.</font>

43
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,147
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, please come in.</font>

44
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,317
<font color="yellow">What brought you here?</font>

45
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:35,447
<font color="yellow">Since when did you volunteer at Home of Angels?</font>

46
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,887
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

47
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:43,087
<font color="yellow">At first, I sang there with my friends.</font>

48
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:48,587
<font color="yellow">That was before the former director passed away. It was 10 years ago.</font>

49
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,547
<font color="yellow">Why did it have to be that orphanage?</font>

50
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:53,347
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

51
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:56,217
<font color="yellow">Why did you start volunteering at an orphanage?</font>

52
00:03:57,717 --> 00:03:59,117
<font color="yellow">I can't stop going there...</font>

53
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,747
<font color="yellow">because the kids are like me.</font>

54
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,547
<font color="yellow">Why do you feel that they are similar to you?</font>

55
00:04:12,117 --> 00:04:15,987
<font color="yellow">I have a mother, but I don't feel like I have one.</font>

56
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,047
<font color="yellow">And I never had a father.</font>

57
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,217
<font color="yellow">That's why.</font>

58
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:28,717
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep asking me these things?</font>

59
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:31,317
<font color="yellow">Your life is so perfect, and you wouldn't understand.</font>

60
00:04:37,447 --> 00:04:40,517
<font color="yellow">Do I look like that? Do I look like I have a perfect life?</font>

61
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:41,947
<font color="yellow">Don't you?</font>

62
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:46,587
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

63
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,647
<font color="yellow">I have to get off here. Get me off here.</font>

64
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,647
<font color="yellow">Bye. It was unexpected, but I was happy to see you. Bye.</font>

65
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,947
<font color="yellow">My guitar. My guitar.</font>

66
00:05:09,147 --> 00:05:10,257
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

67
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:22,087
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

68
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,617
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to come with me?</font>

69
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,317
<font color="yellow">I know, too.</font>

70
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:42,547
<font color="yellow">Know what?</font>

71
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:49,047
<font color="yellow">I know how the kids at the orphanage feel.</font>

72
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:12,787
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

73
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:16,247
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

74
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:18,147
<font color="yellow">I will give an answer.</font>

75
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,087
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

76
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,187
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

77
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:31,347
<font color="yellow">You asked me if I like you.</font>

78
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:33,947
<font color="yellow">I like you.</font>

79
00:07:42,217 --> 00:07:44,887
<font color="yellow">It doesn't mean you have to like me.</font>

80
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,787
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if I like you one-sidedly.</font>

81
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:51,117
<font color="yellow">I am telling you this because...</font>

82
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:54,487
<font color="yellow">I think you should know. No, I want you to know.</font>

83
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:55,917
<font color="yellow">Anyway...</font>

84
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,787
<font color="yellow">My mouth never does me any good.</font>

85
00:08:03,387 --> 00:08:04,517
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

86
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:08,687
<font color="yellow">I am sorry that I like you.</font>

87
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:10,917
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

88
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:23,947
<font color="yellow">Let me go. I am really embarrassed right now.</font>

89
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,117
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Please.</font>

90
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:30,787
<font color="yellow">Do you even know how to get embarrassed?</font>

91
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:35,717
<font color="yellow">You like me.</font>

92
00:08:37,087 --> 00:08:38,247
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

93
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:43,247
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I'm rude and arrogant.</font>

94
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,887
<font color="yellow">Besides, I'm poor now.</font>

95
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:51,017
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

96
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,357
<font color="yellow">I can't understand myself either.</font>

97
00:09:10,357 --> 00:09:11,417
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

98
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:15,517
<font color="yellow">How can you make a slave of someone who likes you?</font>

99
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:18,887
<font color="yellow">If you're not going to accept me, make me go home early.</font>

100
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:22,887
<font color="yellow">If you're going to accept me, you should take me to a nice restaurant.</font>

101
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,747
<font color="yellow">You're not doing either,</font>

102
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,947
<font color="yellow">and you ordered me to make you a cucumber sandwich.</font>

103
00:09:27,947 --> 00:09:30,817
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you're going to use me as your servant?</font>

104
00:09:32,917 --> 00:09:35,017
<font color="yellow">Did you slice the cucumber in 1.5cm-thick slices?</font>

105
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,357
<font color="yellow">Did you add three big spoons of mayonnaise?</font>

106
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:39,047
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

107
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,087
<font color="yellow">Now you are complaining about food, too.</font>

108
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:50,317
<font color="yellow">That's how my dad used to make it.</font>

109
00:09:51,987 --> 00:09:52,987
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

110
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:57,887
<font color="yellow">He sliced the cucumber thicker than you did,</font>

111
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,017
<font color="yellow">and he put a little more mayonnaise.</font>

112
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:11,917
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

113
00:10:12,717 --> 00:10:13,887
<font color="yellow">It's almost there.</font>

114
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,247
<font color="yellow">My mom died early.</font>

115
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:30,817
<font color="yellow">So my dad...</font>

116
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,587
<font color="yellow">raised me and my brother.</font>

117
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:37,687
<font color="yellow">You said you have a little brother.</font>

118
00:10:39,357 --> 00:10:40,357
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

119
00:10:42,587 --> 00:10:46,217
<font color="yellow">My father used to make this for us sometimes.</font>

120
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:50,947
<font color="yellow">All he knew how to cook was ramyeon and kimchi fried rice.</font>

121
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,817
<font color="yellow">The only thing he made well was this cucumber sandwich.</font>

122
00:10:58,247 --> 00:10:59,417
<font color="yellow">What happened to your dad?</font>

123
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,687
<font color="yellow">He died unfairly.</font>

124
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:08,587
<font color="yellow">That's why I lost my little brother.</font>

125
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,847
<font color="yellow">You lost your little brother?</font>

126
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,147
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - How did that happen?</font>

127
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,017
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

128
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,417
<font color="yellow">So I eat this...</font>

129
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:26,087
<font color="yellow">when I miss my father and my brother.</font>

130
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,287
<font color="yellow">I eat it when I miss them, too.</font>

131
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,587
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

132
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,417
<font color="yellow">My head...</font>

133
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,647
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

134
00:12:15,887 --> 00:12:17,887
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here not sleeping at this hour?</font>

135
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:23,217
<font color="yellow">I told you not to eat anything at night.</font>

136
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,847
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, you ate at night because...</font>

137
00:12:26,517 --> 00:12:28,517
<font color="yellow">you didn't know how dangerous it is.</font>

138
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:32,617
<font color="yellow">I will explain it to you why you shouldn't. Listen up.</font>

139
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:35,847
<font color="yellow">When we sleep, melatonin which helps us sleep, secretes,</font>

140
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:38,717
<font color="yellow">but if you eat, your intestines start to move actively.</font>

141
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,747
<font color="yellow">And that movement wakes your nerves which decreases melatonin.</font>

142
00:12:41,747 --> 00:12:43,347
<font color="yellow">In conclusion, it causes insomnia.</font>

143
00:12:43,517 --> 00:12:44,717
<font color="yellow">You do know what insomnia is, right?</font>

144
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,347
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter how much you want to sleep because you can't.</font>

145
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:49,887
<font color="yellow">You end up staying up all night for days.</font>

146
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,617
<font color="yellow">I've never experienced that.</font>

147
00:12:53,847 --> 00:12:55,817
<font color="yellow">Our parasympathetic nerves in our body...</font>

148
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,247
<font color="yellow">stores internal nutrients into our fat tissue.</font>

149
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:01,817
<font color="yellow">When you eat late at night, you won't burn them off.</font>

150
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:04,847
<font color="yellow">It will go straight to your body and it will cause you to gain weight.</font>

151
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:08,347
<font color="yellow">That is how this sort of obese body is created.</font>

152
00:13:09,017 --> 00:13:10,017
<font color="yellow">Did you know that?</font>

153
00:13:10,017 --> 00:13:12,517
<font color="yellow">My body wasn't created drastically.</font>

154
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,717
<font color="yellow">It's been turning into as it is slowly.</font>

155
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:15,817
<font color="yellow">Shut it.</font>

156
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:21,447
<font color="yellow">I can't let this happen.</font>

157
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:24,247
<font color="yellow">Your body is an abuse.</font>

158
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:26,687
<font color="yellow">Your former mother...</font>

159
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:30,487
<font color="yellow">How can she let this happen?</font>

160
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,117
<font color="yellow">Regardless of...</font>

161
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:39,317
<font color="yellow">whether I accept you as my son or not,</font>

162
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,617
<font color="yellow">I can't...</font>

163
00:13:43,017 --> 00:13:44,347
<font color="yellow">let this happen.</font>

164
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:46,617
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do to me?</font>

165
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:47,717
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo.</font>

166
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:49,517
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

167
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:51,787
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

168
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:55,547
<font color="yellow">it's a war with the fat.</font>

169
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,517
<font color="yellow">From now on,</font>

170
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,417
<font color="yellow">I am going to give you a hard training.</font>

171
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:09,447
<font color="yellow">Happy New Year.</font>

172
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,817
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

173
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:14,817
<font color="yellow">Even before 2017 comes,</font>

174
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:18,547
<font color="yellow">some of us got laid off.</font>

175
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,447
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

176
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:37,587
<font color="yellow">I found this business card in his car.</font>

177
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:40,047
<font color="yellow">(Lee Hyun Woo, Manager of Miracle Construction)</font>

178
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:41,217
<font color="yellow">Call this person.</font>

179
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:50,417
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

180
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:53,547
<font color="yellow">Happy...</font>

181
00:14:54,117 --> 00:14:55,647
<font color="yellow">New Year.</font>

182
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:05,087
<font color="yellow">Happy New Year.</font>

183
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:18,917
<font color="yellow">Are you all ready?</font>

184
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:20,717
<font color="yellow">- Welcome, Mother. - Okay.</font>

185
00:15:20,717 --> 00:15:22,447
<font color="yellow">You're wearing the traditional dress.</font>

186
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:25,717
<font color="yellow">I only wore this twice a year although I paid so much for it.</font>

187
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,887
<font color="yellow">It's a dress I feel so unjust about.</font>

188
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,487
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

189
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,147
<font color="yellow">- Then give it to me. - Shut it.</font>

190
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,787
<font color="yellow">Do you know how expensive this is?</font>

191
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,117
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae, are you cooking rice cake soup?</font>

192
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:37,017
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother. I'm cooking the soup.</font>

193
00:15:37,347 --> 00:15:38,647
<font color="yellow">Is it bland?</font>

194
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:55,917
<font color="yellow">- Mom, I'm here. - You're here.</font>

195
00:15:56,217 --> 00:15:57,387
<font color="yellow">Hello, Aunt.</font>

196
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,247
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

197
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,987
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking badly about my son?</font>

198
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:04,887
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to worry you.</font>

199
00:16:05,717 --> 00:16:06,917
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

200
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:09,587
<font color="yellow">You're even spending the new year at someone else's house.</font>

201
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,347
<font color="yellow">You two are fighting again. It's only the beginning of the year.</font>

202
00:16:13,517 --> 00:16:17,217
<font color="yellow">This mother and daughter always fight whenever they meet.</font>

203
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:19,747
<font color="yellow">Have a seat. The floor won't collapse.</font>

204
00:16:21,717 --> 00:16:25,517
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae, Ae Ri is here. Make plenty of soup.</font>

205
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:26,987
<font color="yellow">I will, Mother.</font>

206
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:29,547
<font color="yellow">My gosh. She is so excited.</font>

207
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:31,947
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, are you done with the eggs?</font>

208
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:37,517
<font color="yellow">I told you to cook the eggs for garnish. What are you doing?</font>

209
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,917
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. My gosh. You're impossible.</font>

210
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:44,917
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

211
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:48,217
<font color="yellow">How can you not know how to cook the eggs?</font>

212
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:51,247
<font color="yellow">This is quite challenging.</font>

213
00:16:52,247 --> 00:16:55,387
<font color="yellow">What is not challenging for you?</font>

214
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:58,917
<font color="yellow">You can't do it right. Move aside. I will do it myself.</font>

215
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,247
<font color="yellow">Mother, should I call Hee Sook to come up?</font>

216
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,987
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook is good at this.</font>

217
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:12,817
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

218
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,417
<font color="yellow">You sent her a text message...</font>

219
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,187
<font color="yellow">to come up so that we can cook the soup.</font>

220
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,147
<font color="yellow">She must be ignoring your message.</font>

221
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:28,387
<font color="yellow">How can she ignore your message? You're her dear mother-in-law.</font>

222
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,647
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Yes?</font>

223
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,787
<font color="yellow">You can't even beat her. So stop it already.</font>

224
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,087
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

225
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:38,147
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook came up early morning to say her greetings for the new year.</font>

226
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,917
<font color="yellow">She went to exercise since today's the first day of the year.</font>

227
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,917
<font color="yellow">What? She went to exercise?</font>

228
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:46,947
<font color="yellow">She's driving me crazy.</font>

229
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:05,387
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

230
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,987
<font color="yellow">I can't. I can't...</font>

231
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:10,917
<font color="yellow">run anymore.</font>

232
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,317
<font color="yellow">I told you to get up.</font>

233
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:17,117
<font color="yellow">Aunt. No, I mean Mom.</font>

234
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:20,557
<font color="yellow">I seriously can't run anymore.</font>

235
00:18:23,057 --> 00:18:26,217
<font color="yellow">When I realized your body fat, weight, and the height,</font>

236
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:29,417
<font color="yellow">you need to exercise at least 2 or 3 hours.</font>

237
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:32,217
<font color="yellow">Obesity is a cause of all diseases and will lead you to be bullied.</font>

238
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,517
<font color="yellow">Do you want to live like this?</font>

239
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:38,217
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo. In 2017, you will become...</font>

240
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:40,317
<font color="yellow">a completely different person.</font>

241
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,557
<font color="yellow">So get up.</font>

242
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:45,217
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

243
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:46,847
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

244
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:50,317
<font color="yellow">Please save me, Aunt.</font>

245
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,517
<font color="yellow">Please save me.</font>

246
00:18:53,117 --> 00:18:54,847
<font color="yellow">I think I'm about to die.</font>

247
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,317
<font color="yellow">You call me Aunt when things are not going your way.</font>

248
00:18:57,557 --> 00:18:59,917
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me to adjust, too.</font>

249
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,117
<font color="yellow">That's why you need to lose weight.</font>

250
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:08,517
<font color="yellow">That's how it won't be difficult for you to run.</font>

251
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:10,387
<font color="yellow">Run.</font>

252
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,647
<font color="yellow">Run now.</font>

253
00:19:17,987 --> 00:19:19,887
<font color="yellow">You need to speed up.</font>

254
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,787
<font color="yellow">Will you lose running at this pace?</font>

255
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,087
<font color="yellow">I will just accept the cause of all disease...</font>

256
00:19:26,447 --> 00:19:28,217
<font color="yellow">and be bullied.</font>

257
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:31,087
<font color="yellow">You must have some energy left.</font>

258
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:34,017
<font color="yellow">If you do, then you need to run faster.</font>

259
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:36,517
<font color="yellow">Run. Run faster.</font>

260
00:19:47,217 --> 00:19:49,647
<font color="yellow">This is childish and too old-fashioned.</font>

261
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:51,017
<font color="yellow">What does that mean?</font>

262
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:55,887
<font color="yellow">This isn't possible. It's hackneyed. It needs to be revised.</font>

263
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,847
<font color="yellow">Delete the scene. What is this?</font>

264
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,917
<font color="yellow">"Meanings make emotions."</font>

265
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,947
<font color="yellow">"Cliches don't bring out emotions. I don't feel sympathetic."</font>

266
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,017
<font color="yellow">"Everything must be changed."</font>

267
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:14,447
<font color="yellow">My gosh. He completely ripped my script into pieces.</font>

268
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:16,247
<font color="yellow">Then he should write.</font>

269
00:20:18,057 --> 00:20:19,587
<font color="yellow">We're home.</font>

270
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,887
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, you turned five years old.</font>

271
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:25,617
<font color="yellow">You will listen to me this year, right?</font>

272
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:28,987
<font color="yellow">Hey, Moong Chi.</font>

273
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:38,147
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

274
00:20:43,147 --> 00:20:44,847
<font color="yellow">Aunt, they want you to come down.</font>

275
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,987
<font color="yellow">- Uncle. You, too. - Okay. I will.</font>

276
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,057
<font color="yellow">It's the morning of the new year, Ms. Han.</font>

277
00:20:58,247 --> 00:20:59,447
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good dream?</font>

278
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:02,217
<font color="yellow">I didn't have a dream,</font>

279
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:05,987
<font color="yellow">but it's nice to have everyone gathered here.</font>

280
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:07,087
<font color="yellow">Isn't that so?</font>

281
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:09,887
<font color="yellow">On a day like this, it doesn't matter if you are rich or poor.</font>

282
00:21:10,057 --> 00:21:12,587
<font color="yellow">The family with the most number of people is the best.</font>

283
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:17,187
<font color="yellow">We raised them so hard because...</font>

284
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:19,987
<font color="yellow">we wanted to get together like this. Aren't I right?</font>

285
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,447
<font color="yellow">You're right.</font>

286
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:25,017
<font color="yellow">On a holiday,</font>

287
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:27,947
<font color="yellow">the family with a lot of family members is the most fortunate.</font>

288
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,017
<font color="yellow">- Enjoy it. - Thank you.</font>

289
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:36,947
<font color="yellow">Is it hot?</font>

290
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:39,217
<font color="yellow">This is tasty.</font>

291
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:50,287
<font color="yellow">Why isn't Seong Sik's family here?</font>

292
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,147
<font color="yellow">Mother, Hee Sook went out to exercise.</font>

293
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:55,217
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure if Seong Sik went with her.</font>

294
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,347
<font color="yellow">My head aches.</font>

295
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,187
<font color="yellow">It's about to split.</font>

296
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,187
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

297
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:15,647
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

298
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:17,847
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

299
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,087
<font color="yellow">Where... Where am I?</font>

300
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,917
<font color="yellow">Who brought me here?</font>

301
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,587
<font color="yellow">Why am I in a suite room?</font>

302
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:49,717
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. Gosh.</font>

303
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:55,047
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

304
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:57,087
<font color="yellow">I didn't order any.</font>

305
00:22:57,217 --> 00:23:00,117
<font color="yellow">Someone made an order in advance early in the morning.</font>

306
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,587
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

307
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,987
<font color="yellow">You can also use the sauna for free after breakfast.</font>

308
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,587
<font color="yellow">Of course, all the fees are paid.</font>

309
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,387
<font color="yellow">Then, have a good day.</font>

310
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,887
<font color="yellow">Wait, who did it?</font>

311
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,787
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

312
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:29,947
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Han Seong Sik seemed to be very depressed.</font>

313
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:31,647
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

314
00:23:32,117 --> 00:23:35,247
<font color="yellow">it's understandable since he's fired from the TV show he loved a lot.</font>

315
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,717
<font color="yellow">I told the director of Channel T that Lawyer Han will come back...</font>

316
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,187
<font color="yellow">shortly.</font>

317
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,217
<font color="yellow">There'd be no fun if we give him back right after we deprived.</font>

318
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:48,587
<font color="yellow">- Every game has its own rules. - Then,</font>

319
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,547
<font color="yellow">should I make an appointment with Floor Leader Kim Young Tae?</font>

320
00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:55,287
<font color="yellow">That sounds good.</font>

321
00:23:57,087 --> 00:24:00,287
<font color="yellow">Let's drag Lawyer Han into the political arena.</font>

322
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:03,617
<font color="yellow">Every man is thirst for power.</font>

323
00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:08,587
<font color="yellow">I can't wait to see how chaotic his house will be because of his greed.</font>

324
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:16,917
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

325
00:24:17,987 --> 00:24:20,287
<font color="yellow">Come over and have some rick cake soup.</font>

326
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:21,687
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

327
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:24,247
<font color="yellow">My grandma told me to call you over.</font>

328
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:26,587
<font color="yellow">Will you come or not?</font>

329
00:24:26,747 --> 00:24:30,487
<font color="yellow">You'd better maintain your reputation as a polite young guy.</font>

330
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,717
<font color="yellow">Hurry up. I'll be waiting in front of the house.</font>

331
00:24:33,987 --> 00:24:34,987
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

332
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,617
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun,</font>

333
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,647
<font color="yellow">why do you talk on the phone in Seong Joon's room?</font>

334
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:52,217
<font color="yellow">Why are you so startled?</font>

335
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:55,717
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing. - Will Joong Ki come over?</font>

336
00:24:56,547 --> 00:24:57,547
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

337
00:24:58,517 --> 00:25:01,617
<font color="yellow">- Is Joong Ki our neighbor? - Yes, kind of.</font>

338
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,247
<font color="yellow">Please come in.</font>

339
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:13,547
<font color="yellow">Grandma, he's here.</font>

340
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:15,747
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you made it quick.</font>

341
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,747
<font color="yellow">It's good that our houses are very close.</font>

342
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:20,487
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Welcome, Sir.</font>

343
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:21,617
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

344
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:25,247
<font color="yellow">I was worried that you might be alone. Welcome.</font>

345
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:27,287
<font color="yellow">- Hye Joo, get the soup for him. - Okay.</font>

346
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:29,887
<font color="yellow">Thank you for inviting me.</font>

347
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,247
<font color="yellow">How gentle you are.</font>

348
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,787
<font color="yellow">- Please come have a seat. - Okay.</font>

349
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,447
<font color="yellow">It's not a big deal,</font>

350
00:25:35,787 --> 00:25:38,287
<font color="yellow">but we always gather and share rice cake soup...</font>

351
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,447
<font color="yellow">on the New Year's Day.</font>

352
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:44,547
<font color="yellow">You're so humble. You look great, and I envy you.</font>

353
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:49,317
<font color="yellow">This is Ms. Oh, our in-law.</font>

354
00:25:50,147 --> 00:25:51,617
<font color="yellow">It's great to meet you.</font>

355
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:54,617
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. It's nice to see you. - Thank you.</font>

356
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,817
<font color="yellow">She's my sister.</font>

357
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:00,147
<font color="yellow">I see. Hello.</font>

358
00:26:00,887 --> 00:26:03,087
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

359
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:06,517
<font color="yellow">I'm Jeong Eun's mother.</font>

360
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:10,817
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

361
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,487
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you.</font>

362
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:15,517
<font color="yellow">Me, too.</font>

363
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,817
<font color="yellow">- Why don't you bring some soup? - Okay.</font>

364
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:20,247
<font color="yellow">Let me bring it.</font>

365
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:24,647
<font color="yellow">- Please sit down. - Thank you.</font>

366
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:26,017
<font color="yellow">Sit over there.</font>

367
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:31,847
<font color="yellow">There she is.</font>

368
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:37,147
<font color="yellow">- Here. - Thank you.</font>

369
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,287
<font color="yellow">Please eat up, Mr. Lee.</font>

370
00:26:42,417 --> 00:26:44,217
<font color="yellow">I will. Thank you.</font>

371
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:50,147
<font color="yellow">You really eat well. Is it good?</font>

372
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,517
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's very tasty.</font>

373
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:57,047
<font color="yellow">I wish I had a young daughter so that I can marry her off to you.</font>

374
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,747
<font color="yellow">Goodness, how nasty.</font>

375
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,387
<font color="yellow">Stop it. I'm sure no one would ever want to marry her.</font>

376
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:06,487
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I'll take it as a compliment.</font>

377
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,687
<font color="yellow">It is definitely a compliment. I like you so much.</font>

378
00:27:11,887 --> 00:27:14,447
<font color="yellow">By the way, how old are you?</font>

379
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:17,217
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - How old are you?</font>

380
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:18,887
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you want to marry him?</font>

381
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:20,517
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

382
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,687
<font color="yellow">My family is quite raucous, isn't it?</font>

383
00:27:30,747 --> 00:27:33,117
<font color="yellow">Yet, it's way better than staying alone on the New Year's Day.</font>

384
00:27:37,147 --> 00:27:38,447
<font color="yellow">Why do you like me?</font>

385
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:42,117
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - It becomes unfavorable to you.</font>

386
00:27:42,817 --> 00:27:44,117
<font color="yellow">You'll expose your weaknesses.</font>

387
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,817
<font color="yellow">You just enjoyed the soup. What's with that question out of the blue?</font>

388
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:55,017
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you for inviting me to your family gathering.</font>

389
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:58,247
<font color="yellow">I'm giving you an advice in return for the soup.</font>

390
00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:02,287
<font color="yellow">Do not like me.</font>

391
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,047
<font color="yellow">That's for your own good.</font>

392
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:16,147
<font color="yellow">My throat sores.</font>

393
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,317
<font color="yellow">I won't give up here.</font>

394
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:23,287
<font color="yellow">It took me so long to be a panel. I can never lose it like this.</font>

395
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:28,387
<font color="yellow">There must be a plot.</font>

396
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,787
<font color="yellow">I will discover the plot...</font>

397
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:33,887
<font color="yellow">and get the panel position back.</font>

398
00:28:35,917 --> 00:28:39,387
<font color="yellow">Women viewers love me so much. How dare they give me...</font>

399
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,947
<font color="yellow">such a preposterous excuse?</font>

400
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,217
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han.</font>

401
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:49,747
<font color="yellow">Hello. You look busy.</font>

402
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:58,347
<font color="yellow">Lawyer Kim Jong Wook will join the show as a new panel.</font>

403
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,917
<font color="yellow">My throat... What... What did you say?</font>

404
00:29:04,587 --> 00:29:07,247
<font color="yellow">He's so lame compared to me.</font>

405
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:12,187
<font color="yellow">He has achieved nothing in his career.</font>

406
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,787
<font color="yellow">He barely passed the bar exam.</font>

407
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:17,787
<font color="yellow">He even ranked the bottom in the post-training course.</font>

408
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:20,417
<font color="yellow">He'd never been able to stand by my side.</font>

409
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:23,487
<font color="yellow">How on earth could he...</font>

410
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:25,747
<font color="yellow">take my place?</font>

411
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:29,387
<font color="yellow">Goodness. I guess you should grow up.</font>

412
00:29:30,117 --> 00:29:33,687
<font color="yellow">He has his father, who is Senior Secretary of the Blue House.</font>

413
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:37,917
<font color="yellow">He has the greatest asset. What are you talking about?</font>

414
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:44,817
<font color="yellow">Having powerful parents is the most valuable asset.</font>

415
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,317
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

416
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:52,187
<font color="yellow">However, leading an ordinary life isn't that bad.</font>

417
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:00,317
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang already...</font>

418
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,147
<font color="yellow">started flirting with Laywer Kim Jong Wook.</font>

419
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:06,747
<font color="yellow">Yoo... Yoo Ra did?</font>

420
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:10,587
<font color="yellow">I told you that she cares wealth and power the most.</font>

421
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:23,087
<font color="yellow">Sir. Sir!</font>

422
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,917
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! Sir!</font>

423
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:27,817
<font color="yellow">Sir! I said let me go! Goodness.</font>

424
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,217
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You jerks!</font>

425
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:34,217
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

426
00:30:35,117 --> 00:30:38,887
<font color="yellow">You know how dedicated I have been to this broadcasting station.</font>

427
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:42,017
<font color="yellow">I rather deserve an award for my contribution!</font>

428
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:44,747
<font color="yellow">You pieces of trash!</font>

429
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:47,217
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

430
00:30:48,417 --> 00:30:49,717
<font color="yellow">Mr. Han.</font>

431
00:30:52,487 --> 00:30:53,717
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

432
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,417
<font color="yellow">Don't you think it'd only make you...</font>

433
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,487
<font color="yellow">look even more pathetic?</font>

434
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:01,987
<font color="yellow">What? Pathetic?</font>

435
00:31:03,387 --> 00:31:05,347
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Yes?</font>

436
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:09,187
<font color="yellow">Please stop being nerdy and try to be a cool man.</font>

437
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:12,787
<font color="yellow">Look at yourself. You're not a child.</font>

438
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:16,387
<font color="yellow">Isn't it too childish to make a fuss all over here...</font>

439
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:18,117
<font color="yellow">because you're fired?</font>

440
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:19,987
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

441
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:22,187
<font color="yellow">Did you say I'm childish?</font>

442
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,587
<font color="yellow">I did. Please...</font>

443
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,247
<font color="yellow">don't come here. Okay?</font>

444
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:38,387
<font color="yellow">Yoo Ra. Hey!</font>

445
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,387
<font color="yellow">You will regret it. You will!</font>

446
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,017
<font color="yellow">I will make you regret it, okay?</font>

447
00:31:55,117 --> 00:31:57,487
<font color="yellow">What do men do when they try to win girls' hearts?</font>

448
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:59,517
<font color="yellow">Is it a movie from the 1970s?</font>

449
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,847
<font color="yellow">Were you even born in 1970s?</font>

450
00:32:01,847 --> 00:32:04,247
<font color="yellow">Do I have to live in that period to know what's cliche?</font>

451
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:05,387
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

452
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:08,317
<font color="yellow">Be quiet, Moong Chi. Dong Hui's upset.</font>

453
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:10,487
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am upset.</font>

454
00:32:10,487 --> 00:32:13,517
<font color="yellow">How can you draw red lines on my script and...</font>

455
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,947
<font color="yellow">leave comments like "It's childish", "It's cliche", "Fix it",</font>

456
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,817
<font color="yellow">"Take it out", and "I don't get this"?</font>

457
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:19,717
<font color="yellow">How can you be so mean?</font>

458
00:32:19,717 --> 00:32:21,947
<font color="yellow">You asked me to support you.</font>

459
00:32:22,087 --> 00:32:23,817
<font color="yellow">I was trying to support you.</font>

460
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:28,187
<font color="yellow">What kind of a man says a pickup line like...</font>

461
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:30,387
<font color="yellow">"I fell in love with you at first sight" these days?</font>

462
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:34,117
<font color="yellow">That's what happened in 1970s.</font>

463
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:37,587
<font color="yellow">Why? Should we ask the stars now?</font>

464
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,147
<font color="yellow">He's a womanizer. He just dates girls without love.</font>

465
00:32:41,147 --> 00:32:42,717
<font color="yellow">That's why it's more cliche.</font>

466
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:45,517
<font color="yellow">There's no man like him these days.</font>

467
00:32:46,887 --> 00:32:48,117
<font color="yellow">You know very well.</font>

468
00:32:48,517 --> 00:32:49,687
<font color="yellow">You've never dated, have you?</font>

469
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:51,547
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - It's too obvious.</font>

470
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:53,587
<font color="yellow">Like it says here, you learned romance through writings</font>

471
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:56,617
<font color="yellow">"Romance Learned through Books".</font>

472
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,917
<font color="yellow">Hey. I may look like this,</font>

473
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:01,417
<font color="yellow">but I made all the way to the final round of the script contest.</font>

474
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:04,587
<font color="yellow">I submitted my script everywhere and now I'm waiting for the result.</font>

475
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:07,987
<font color="yellow">Why is it so loud here?</font>

476
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:11,647
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

477
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:16,287
<font color="yellow">Are you fighting so that all the neighbors will hear it?</font>

478
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:19,917
<font color="yellow">If you have something to say, you could go in and talk</font>

479
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:22,217
<font color="yellow">Why would you talk here in this cold weather?</font>

480
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,247
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

481
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,317
<font color="yellow">Go inside.</font>

482
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:27,417
<font color="yellow">You are embarrassing us.</font>

483
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:30,117
<font color="yellow">People would think there's a fight in the house.</font>

484
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:31,817
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's go in.</font>

485
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:35,347
<font color="yellow">The dog is all worked up, and the weather is cold. It's chaotic.</font>

486
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:49,847
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking around?</font>

487
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:52,087
<font color="yellow">It's my first time to visit a woman's room.</font>

488
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:55,187
<font color="yellow">Hey, this is not a woman's room.</font>

489
00:33:55,187 --> 00:33:57,817
<font color="yellow">It's the room I share with my grandma.</font>

490
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:03,287
<font color="yellow">You must relate everything to romance.</font>

491
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,747
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with that? Can't I do that? That's my job.</font>

492
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:12,017
<font color="yellow">- Do you want some tea? - No.</font>

493
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,287
<font color="yellow">Then hurry up and sit.</font>

494
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:18,817
<font color="yellow">Anyway.</font>

495
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:23,587
<font color="yellow">What did she do so wrong to face the wall?</font>

496
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:28,487
<font color="yellow">Just leave her there. Don't touch my thing.</font>

497
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:30,217
<font color="yellow">I gave you that.</font>

498
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:32,017
<font color="yellow">So it's mine now.</font>

499
00:34:33,587 --> 00:34:36,647
<font color="yellow">She's going to watch you...</font>

500
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:38,847
<font color="yellow">and see if you write something cliche again.</font>

501
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:41,317
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

502
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,517
<font color="yellow">Okay. Fine. I have nothing to say about that.</font>

503
00:34:53,687 --> 00:34:56,147
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to make you understand.</font>

504
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:58,887
<font color="yellow">I understand well now.</font>

505
00:34:59,117 --> 00:35:01,087
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

506
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:04,547
<font color="yellow">isn't it funnier if it's intentionally childish?</font>

507
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:07,487
<font color="yellow">Comedy becomes uncomfortable when you cross the line.</font>

508
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:09,847
<font color="yellow">Also, it's not realistic at all.</font>

509
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,617
<font color="yellow">Romantic comedy doesn't have any realistic side.</font>

510
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:16,457
<font color="yellow">Besides, love is like mirage.</font>

511
00:35:16,457 --> 00:35:18,957
<font color="yellow">It's something unrealistic and old-fashioned as well.</font>

512
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,887
<font color="yellow">You will be in big trouble if your script is old-fashioned.</font>

513
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:23,047
<font color="yellow">Romantic comedy is the most stylish genre.</font>

514
00:35:25,847 --> 00:35:27,117
<font color="yellow">Stop getting so upset.</font>

515
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:30,317
<font color="yellow">When you go to a store, people might mistake you as a tomato.</font>

516
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,187
<font color="yellow">I am not upset.</font>

517
00:35:34,187 --> 00:35:35,487
<font color="yellow">You are upset.</font>

518
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,847
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You get upset whenever I say something.</font>

519
00:35:40,247 --> 00:35:41,417
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

520
00:35:43,347 --> 00:35:44,587
<font color="yellow">Are you hitting your teacher?</font>

521
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:55,747
<font color="yellow">My body hurts. My body is so sore.</font>

522
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,887
<font color="yellow">I hope all the holidays...</font>

523
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:03,687
<font color="yellow">in the world disappear.</font>

524
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,187
<font color="yellow">Just disappear!</font>

525
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:13,747
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee Sook didn't show up all day.</font>

526
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,817
<font color="yellow">My legs don't move.</font>

527
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,887
<font color="yellow">Stop being such a cry baby. Come in.</font>

528
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,617
<font color="yellow">Will you continue being a cry baby?</font>

529
00:36:24,217 --> 00:36:25,987
<font color="yellow">I'm not being a cry baby.</font>

530
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,457
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

531
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:29,217
<font color="yellow">What are you two up to?</font>

532
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,047
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

533
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:35,117
<font color="yellow">Where did you go when you should be cooking rice cake soup?</font>

534
00:36:35,117 --> 00:36:37,817
<font color="yellow">Will you keep disappearing whenever we have...</font>

535
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,147
<font color="yellow">a family event?</font>

536
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:42,217
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? I went out to exercise.</font>

537
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:43,847
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

538
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:46,517
<font color="yellow">why are you trying to lose weight alone?</font>

539
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:49,417
<font color="yellow">Is my body already beyond help?</font>

540
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:52,517
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

541
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:56,147
<font color="yellow">I exercised to lose weight?</font>

542
00:36:56,517 --> 00:36:59,317
<font color="yellow">I don't have to lose weight. I'm already perfect.</font>

543
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:00,387
<font color="yellow">Then?</font>

544
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:01,647
<font color="yellow">It was for him.</font>

545
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:03,347
<font color="yellow">It was for this boy.</font>

546
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:05,287
<font color="yellow">It was for this boy, whom you raised...</font>

547
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:08,117
<font color="yellow">for the past 15 years without thinking.</font>

548
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:10,887
<font color="yellow">According to WHO's...</font>

549
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:14,147
<font color="yellow">obesity classification, he has a third-level obesity.</font>

550
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,317
<font color="yellow">It was for your former son,</font>

551
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,957
<font color="yellow">who is at the critical stage.</font>

552
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:21,887
<font color="yellow">I took him out for a morning exercise.</font>

553
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:23,457
<font color="yellow">Do you get it?</font>

554
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:26,517
<font color="yellow">Mom, save me.</font>

555
00:37:26,717 --> 00:37:28,457
<font color="yellow">I'm hungry.</font>

556
00:37:30,187 --> 00:37:31,217
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

557
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,917
<font color="yellow">Go back there.</font>

558
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:36,117
<font color="yellow">I know well that...</font>

559
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:39,287
<font color="yellow">you are a betrayer and that you have no moral.</font>

560
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:44,147
<font color="yellow">You are the boy who eats gourmet sausage from Germany...</font>

561
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:47,987
<font color="yellow">and romantic bread made with milk produced by cows...</font>

562
00:37:47,987 --> 00:37:51,047
<font color="yellow">running in the fields of Hokkaido.</font>

563
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,987
<font color="yellow">Move there. Okay?</font>

564
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:55,517
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

565
00:37:56,687 --> 00:37:57,917
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

566
00:37:59,017 --> 00:38:00,987
<font color="yellow">Go inside the bathroom now.</font>

567
00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:03,957
<font color="yellow">Go take a shower. Quick!</font>

568
00:38:06,987 --> 00:38:08,717
<font color="yellow">Wash yourself well, okay?</font>

569
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:15,147
<font color="yellow">Why? Do you feel bad for your former son?</font>

570
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:16,417
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

571
00:38:16,817 --> 00:38:18,047
<font color="yellow">I don't feel bad.</font>

572
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:21,587
<font color="yellow">I don't have any more lingering feelings for him.</font>

573
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:24,187
<font color="yellow">He met the right person.</font>

574
00:38:26,617 --> 00:38:28,957
<font color="yellow">Of course. Who am I?</font>

575
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:31,817
<font color="yellow">I am going to make him...</font>

576
00:38:31,817 --> 00:38:34,147
<font color="yellow">into a totally new person and show you.</font>

577
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,717
<font color="yellow">Watch me and reflect on yourself.</font>

578
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:38,587
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

579
00:38:39,887 --> 00:38:41,317
<font color="yellow">She's unbelievable.</font>

580
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:46,787
<font color="yellow">By the way, Mom,</font>

581
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:48,957
<font color="yellow">isn't that rice cake?</font>

582
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:50,917
<font color="yellow">Can I have some?</font>

583
00:38:51,187 --> 00:38:52,787
<font color="yellow">I love rice cake soup, you know?</font>

584
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,217
<font color="yellow">Who told you to come out? Go back inside.</font>

585
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:56,717
<font color="yellow">Who...</font>

586
00:38:57,517 --> 00:39:01,247
<font color="yellow">just called me "Mom"?</font>

587
00:39:01,647 --> 00:39:05,217
<font color="yellow">Call me "Aunt" now.</font>

588
00:39:05,647 --> 00:39:06,687
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

589
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,647
<font color="yellow">Our relationship is...</font>

590
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:12,047
<font color="yellow">already over.</font>

591
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,587
<font color="yellow">Live well with your new mother.</font>

592
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,617
<font color="yellow">I will go cook the rice cake soup...</font>

593
00:39:20,687 --> 00:39:22,587
<font color="yellow">for my son who is the top of his class.</font>

594
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:25,747
<font color="yellow">I will add beef and make it all delicious.</font>

595
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,457
<font color="yellow">Are you teasing someone?</font>

596
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,117
<font color="yellow">You two.</font>

597
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:31,187
<font color="yellow">- What? - What?</font>

598
00:39:31,317 --> 00:39:33,517
<font color="yellow">I'm teasing you!</font>

599
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:34,687
<font color="yellow">- Mom! - Hye Joo!</font>

600
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:41,487
<font color="yellow">I hate her. Go back inside.</font>

601
00:39:41,487 --> 00:39:44,117
<font color="yellow">Go back inside. Now.</font>

602
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:03,457
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

603
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:07,347
<font color="yellow">You've been studying.</font>

604
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:10,317
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think I wasted too much time in the morning...</font>

605
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:12,187
<font color="yellow">eating the rice cake soup.</font>

606
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:14,547
<font color="yellow">I'm going to study a little in the afternoon.</font>

607
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,187
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon,</font>

608
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,087
<font color="yellow">you are truly amazing.</font>

609
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,187
<font color="yellow">Don't say that.</font>

610
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:24,047
<font color="yellow">What do you want to eat? Do you want some fruits?</font>

611
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,287
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

612
00:40:25,587 --> 00:40:27,817
<font color="yellow">I don't eat anything when I study.</font>

613
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,547
<font color="yellow">When blood goes to the stomach,</font>

614
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:32,117
<font color="yellow">my head becomes dull.</font>

615
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:34,547
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

616
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,117
<font color="yellow">Did you wash well?</font>

617
00:40:43,617 --> 00:40:45,517
<font color="yellow">Yes. I washed well.</font>

618
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:48,047
<font color="yellow">Do you like the pajamas?</font>

619
00:40:48,687 --> 00:40:52,087
<font color="yellow">I couldn't care about the design as I had to look for the right size.</font>

620
00:40:52,587 --> 00:40:53,687
<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

621
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:57,687
<font color="yellow">You saw your former mother...</font>

622
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,617
<font color="yellow">looking down on you, didn't you?</font>

623
00:41:00,217 --> 00:41:02,017
<font color="yellow">I saw that.</font>

624
00:41:02,217 --> 00:41:04,047
<font color="yellow">She said that...</font>

625
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:07,187
<font color="yellow">you weren't her son anymore.</font>

626
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:10,147
<font color="yellow">Yes. I heard that, too.</font>

627
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:13,417
<font color="yellow">Forget the past.</font>

628
00:41:13,957 --> 00:41:15,957
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

629
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:18,787
<font color="yellow">And don't...</font>

630
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:21,847
<font color="yellow">humiliate me.</font>

631
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:24,217
<font color="yellow">Yes. I won't.</font>

632
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:30,347
<font color="yellow">That bean came from the Andes of South America.</font>

633
00:41:31,017 --> 00:41:32,547
<font color="yellow">It's considered the mother of grain.</font>

634
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:34,987
<font color="yellow">This bean is good enough.</font>

635
00:41:36,547 --> 00:41:38,617
<font color="yellow">- Eat it. - Okay.</font>

636
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:55,747
<font color="yellow">Where is Mother?</font>

637
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:59,217
<font color="yellow">She goes to bed around 8pm.</font>

638
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,217
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

639
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,387
<font color="yellow">Your restaurant will open soon.</font>

640
00:42:05,617 --> 00:42:07,717
<font color="yellow">It seems like they started the construction yesterday.</font>

641
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:09,817
<font color="yellow">I couldn't have done it without you and Mom.</font>

642
00:42:11,087 --> 00:42:13,817
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - Don't be silly.</font>

643
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:16,117
<font color="yellow">Do you really realize you should be sorry?</font>

644
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:17,517
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae.</font>

645
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,547
<font color="yellow">You should pull yourself together.</font>

646
00:42:19,887 --> 00:42:23,117
<font color="yellow">Work hard and pay back the money you owe us.</font>

647
00:42:23,747 --> 00:42:25,317
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

648
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,287
<font color="yellow">Did you have to be say that?</font>

649
00:42:27,987 --> 00:42:30,817
<font color="yellow">- When are you removing your cast? - I'll remove it tomorrow.</font>

650
00:42:31,247 --> 00:42:33,847
<font color="yellow">- Is that so? - Shall I take you to the hospital?</font>

651
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:35,487
<font color="yellow">It's fine. I can go by myself.</font>

652
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:40,147
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Seong Sik? I haven't seen him all day.</font>

653
00:42:40,817 --> 00:42:43,787
<font color="yellow">He should come upstairs and help his brother.</font>

654
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:45,687
<font color="yellow">You're right. I haven't seen him all day, either.</font>

655
00:42:46,247 --> 00:42:47,887
<font color="yellow">Have you seen Seong Sik?</font>

656
00:42:48,587 --> 00:42:49,887
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't.</font>

657
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,047
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

658
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:58,217
<font color="yellow">No matter how hard you try, it'll be all useless.</font>

659
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:02,917
<font color="yellow">It goes the same for you, too. You just...</font>

660
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:07,147
<font color="yellow">shine for a while, but that'll be all.</font>

661
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:08,647
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

662
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,247
<font color="yellow">a gas lamp, right?</font>

663
00:43:12,617 --> 00:43:13,847
<font color="yellow">You will...</font>

664
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,847
<font color="yellow">probably be replaced by...</font>

665
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:20,717
<font color="yellow">an LED lamp that has good connections soon.</font>

666
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:23,487
<font color="yellow">They say a great man can rise from a humble family,</font>

667
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:25,917
<font color="yellow">but it's not like that these days.</font>

668
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,517
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Poor you.</font>

669
00:43:32,387 --> 00:43:33,387
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

670
00:43:34,747 --> 00:43:35,817
<font color="yellow">Why can't...</font>

671
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,717
<font color="yellow">a great man rise from a humble family?</font>

672
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:42,687
<font color="yellow">Why do I...</font>

673
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:47,687
<font color="yellow">have to live such an unsuccessful life? Why?</font>

674
00:43:50,517 --> 00:43:52,587
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Lawyer Han Seong Sik.</font>

675
00:43:57,087 --> 00:43:58,947
<font color="yellow">You drink very often these days.</font>

676
00:44:01,447 --> 00:44:03,117
<font color="yellow">Look who it is.</font>

677
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:08,287
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mr. Lee.</font>

678
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:12,217
<font color="yellow">- Yes. I'm Lee Hyun Woo. - Oh, dear.</font>

679
00:44:13,747 --> 00:44:17,287
<font color="yellow">You're my sweet and kind neighbor.</font>

680
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:22,517
<font color="yellow">You're my kind neighbor who lends me an expensive car...</font>

681
00:44:22,717 --> 00:44:24,647
<font color="yellow">without any problem.</font>

682
00:44:30,717 --> 00:44:33,647
<font color="yellow">- Let me give you a kiss. - It looks like you drank too much.</font>

683
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,817
<font color="yellow">Let's go. I'll walk you home.</font>

684
00:44:38,117 --> 00:44:39,117
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

685
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:43,887
<font color="yellow">I'm so jealous of you, Hyun Woo.</font>

686
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:47,587
<font color="yellow">I heard your uncle is rich.</font>

687
00:44:47,747 --> 00:44:50,547
<font color="yellow">You probably have nothing to worry about, then.</font>

688
00:44:51,017 --> 00:44:53,887
<font color="yellow">That must be great, right?</font>

689
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,087
<font color="yellow">You have great parents, too.</font>

690
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:02,287
<font color="yellow">Weren't you able to become a lawyer because of their support?</font>

691
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,287
<font color="yellow">It's not their support that made me a lawyer.</font>

692
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,317
<font color="yellow">I studied very hard,</font>

693
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:10,647
<font color="yellow">and became a lawyer myself.</font>

694
00:45:11,817 --> 00:45:13,787
<font color="yellow">Your parents would be disappointed to hear that.</font>

695
00:45:15,487 --> 00:45:16,887
<font color="yellow">Let's go. We're almost here.</font>

696
00:45:20,547 --> 00:45:21,817
<font color="yellow">This is...</font>

697
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:24,747
<font color="yellow">so unfair to me.</font>

698
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:31,417
<font color="yellow">Kim Jong Wook, that jerk.</font>

699
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:41,147
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? My goodness.</font>

700
00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:42,617
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What's going on?</font>

701
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:45,647
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik. Why did you drink so much?</font>

702
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:48,117
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to intrude like this at a late hour.</font>

703
00:45:48,187 --> 00:45:50,487
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with him? Did you two drink together?</font>

704
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:54,187
<font color="yellow">No. He was outside, and I was worried because it's cold.</font>

705
00:45:54,847 --> 00:45:57,517
<font color="yellow">My gosh. How could you stay out all day...</font>

706
00:45:57,517 --> 00:46:01,317
<font color="yellow">on a new year's day, and come home drunk like this?</font>

707
00:46:01,947 --> 00:46:04,387
<font color="yellow">You should've gone to your house. Why did you come up here?</font>

708
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,947
<font color="yellow">- Mom! - Gosh, you startled me.</font>

709
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,817
<font color="yellow">Why are you yelling?</font>

710
00:46:08,617 --> 00:46:09,847
<font color="yellow">Dad!</font>

711
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,117
<font color="yellow">- Yes. What is it? - Why is our family...</font>

712
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:15,947
<font color="yellow">so unfortunate?</font>

713
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:20,187
<font color="yellow">- What? - What are you saying?</font>

714
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:21,517
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

715
00:46:22,587 --> 00:46:25,347
<font color="yellow">have such an unsuccessful life, Dad?</font>

716
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:32,647
<font color="yellow">- Seong Sik. - Get off of me, you punk!</font>

717
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:34,847
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. I can't believe him. What's wrong with you?</font>

718
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:36,347
<font color="yellow">Why did you make me...</font>

719
00:46:37,617 --> 00:46:41,347
<font color="yellow">someone from a family with no money or connections?</font>

720
00:46:42,117 --> 00:46:43,387
<font color="yellow">Why did you...</font>

721
00:46:44,147 --> 00:46:47,117
<font color="yellow">make me someone who is from an insignificant family?</font>

722
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:51,217
<font color="yellow">- Come here, you brat. - Let go of me!</font>

723
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,717
<font color="yellow">Hey. Stop it right now.</font>

724
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:57,417
<font color="yellow">- What on earth are you doing? - Think about what I've done!</font>

725
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:00,787
<font color="yellow">I graduated from Seoul National University,</font>

726
00:47:02,117 --> 00:47:04,787
<font color="yellow">proudly passed the bar exam,</font>

727
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,917
<font color="yellow">and brought...</font>

728
00:47:07,217 --> 00:47:10,817
<font color="yellow">a great joy to you two, didn't I?</font>

729
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,987
<font color="yellow">But what have you...</font>

730
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,987
<font color="yellow">ever done for me,</font>

731
00:47:16,987 --> 00:47:19,587
<font color="yellow">your proud son? What?</font>

732
00:47:20,217 --> 00:47:22,147
<font color="yellow">Honey. What's wrong with him?</font>

733
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,087
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?</font>

734
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,047
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik. Stop. Let's go downstairs.</font>

735
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,117
<font color="yellow">- Go downstairs now. - Dad.</font>

736
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:33,717
<font color="yellow">Why are you so incompetent?</font>

737
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:37,417
<font color="yellow">And why is our family so insignificant?</font>

738
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:42,287
<font color="yellow">Why are you so unsuccessful that you can't even back me up?</font>

739
00:47:50,847 --> 00:47:52,287
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

740
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:56,047
<font color="yellow">Why are we living like this?</font>

741
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:58,587
<font color="yellow">- Let's get him out of here. - Let's go.</font>

742
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:02,217
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let go of me. Mom, Dad!</font>

743
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:06,647
<font color="yellow">Something so unfair had happened to me today.</font>

744
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:11,017
<font color="yellow">It was so unfair!</font>

745
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:14,747
<font color="yellow">It's unfair!</font>

746
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,017
<font color="yellow">Although my dad was an alcoholic who...</font>

747
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:43,317
<font color="yellow">lived in a shabby room that didn't even had heating,</font>

748
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:48,187
<font color="yellow">and had a low life which he lived from hand to mouth,</font>

749
00:48:49,647 --> 00:48:51,787
<font color="yellow">I never blamed my dad.</font>

750
00:48:55,417 --> 00:48:59,247
<font color="yellow">Even when everyone in town pointed their fingers at him,</font>

751
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:01,547
<font color="yellow">and trampled all over him,</font>

752
00:49:03,647 --> 00:49:05,617
<font color="yellow">I didn't blame him.</font>

753
00:49:08,347 --> 00:49:10,187
<font color="yellow">My dad was a good person.</font>

754
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,047
<font color="yellow">I blamed those who drove him into a corner instead.</font>

755
00:49:18,217 --> 00:49:20,047
<font color="yellow">I only resented my dad for...</font>

756
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:23,587
<font color="yellow">killing himself...</font>

757
00:49:25,647 --> 00:49:28,187
<font color="yellow">and leaving me and my brother behind.</font>

758
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:44,317
<font color="yellow">But children these days...</font>

759
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:48,717
<font color="yellow">blame their families and even deny them.</font>

760
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,287
<font color="yellow">Children don't realize that their parents are...</font>

761
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:54,787
<font color="yellow">the only ones who wouldn't let go of their hands...</font>

762
00:49:55,817 --> 00:49:57,717
<font color="yellow">and who would give them hope...</font>

763
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,987
<font color="yellow">when they're swept away in the strong current.</font>

764
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:35,117
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - You didn't come to my cafe today.</font>

765
00:50:35,517 --> 00:50:36,517
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

766
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:45,517
<font color="yellow">It's my daily duty to give the landlord cucumber sandwiches.</font>

767
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:50,917
<font color="yellow">There're two. My uncle isn't home right now.</font>

768
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:52,247
<font color="yellow">It's not for your uncle.</font>

769
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,447
<font color="yellow">It's for your brother.</font>

770
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:07,517
<font color="yellow">He'd want to eat it as well since it's what your dad used to make.</font>

771
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:11,017
<font color="yellow">From now on, I'll give you two sandwiches every day,</font>

772
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:15,717
<font color="yellow">so you can eat it together with him whenever he comes back.</font>

773
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:21,217
<font color="yellow">This is something my grandma said.</font>

774
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:23,917
<font color="yellow">Mothers used to prepare an extra bowl of rice at every meal...</font>

775
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:26,217
<font color="yellow">if one of their children is away from home.</font>

776
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:28,917
<font color="yellow">They believed it would make them come back home sooner.</font>

777
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:30,547
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

778
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:34,647
<font color="yellow">they wished their child wouldn't be starving somewhere.</font>

779
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:39,587
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll find your brother soon.</font>

780
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,287
<font color="yellow">I'll be going now.</font>

781
00:51:43,717 --> 00:51:45,687
<font color="yellow">Oh, I almost forgot.</font>

782
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,317
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

783
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:48,987
<font color="yellow">These are...</font>

784
00:51:51,987 --> 00:51:53,017
<font color="yellow">What are these?</font>

785
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,947
<font color="yellow">These are movie tickets...</font>

786
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,917
<font color="yellow">from the headquarter for opening the cafe.</font>

787
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,817
<font color="yellow">It's tonight. Why don't we watch it together?</font>

788
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:05,747
<font color="yellow">Come when you finish work.</font>

789
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:09,587
<font color="yellow">I will buy popcorn and wait for you. I wanted to watch this movie.</font>

790
00:52:11,117 --> 00:52:12,247
<font color="yellow">I'm busy today.</font>

791
00:52:12,317 --> 00:52:15,747
<font color="yellow">That's why you can come whenever you finish work.</font>

792
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:17,717
<font color="yellow">I will get going.</font>

793
00:52:51,987 --> 00:52:54,047
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Chang Soo?</font>

794
00:52:56,747 --> 00:52:58,247
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

795
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:06,117
<font color="yellow">This is weird.</font>

796
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:09,087
<font color="yellow">I saw it this morning.</font>

797
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:11,287
<font color="yellow">What are you looking for?</font>

798
00:53:11,617 --> 00:53:13,987
<font color="yellow">I can't find stir-fried dried squid and black beans...</font>

799
00:53:13,987 --> 00:53:15,517
<font color="yellow">cooked in soy sauce.</font>

800
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,947
<font color="yellow">Those were all the side dishes I had.</font>

801
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:21,317
<font color="yellow">I threw them out when I was cleaning the refrigerator.</font>

802
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:23,317
<font color="yellow">You threw them out?</font>

803
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:26,217
<font color="yellow">- Why? - It's because they looked old.</font>

804
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:31,087
<font color="yellow">I threw out watery soybean paste, hardened spicy paste,</font>

805
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:32,517
<font color="yellow">smelly dried lavers,</font>

806
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,317
<font color="yellow">and softened vegetables. I threw all of them out.</font>

807
00:53:38,087 --> 00:53:40,547
<font color="yellow">They might look like that, but they are still edible.</font>

808
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:43,147
<font color="yellow">No, you shouldn't eat them. You get a stomachache if you do.</font>

809
00:53:43,447 --> 00:53:46,017
<font color="yellow">Besides, Ah In is young.</font>

810
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:47,947
<font color="yellow">Her immune system can't fight the viruses well.</font>

811
00:53:48,117 --> 00:53:52,017
<font color="yellow">She shouldn't eat food that's even slightly rotten or gone bad.</font>

812
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:01,947
<font color="yellow">Is that so? What should we eat, then?</font>

813
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:05,347
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo. You think I don't know you're here?</font>

814
00:54:06,017 --> 00:54:07,087
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

815
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:09,947
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking for your son at my house?</font>

816
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:13,517
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo isn't here?</font>

817
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:14,987
<font color="yellow">No, he isn't.</font>

818
00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:18,647
<font color="yellow">Where did you lose your son and why are you looking for him here?</font>

819
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:22,587
<font color="yellow">Let's take care of our son well.</font>

820
00:54:28,787 --> 00:54:29,947
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

821
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:36,247
<font color="yellow">Gosh, she is so weird.</font>

822
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,317
<font color="yellow">Then, why don't we...</font>

823
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:42,487
<font color="yellow">eat the rice with spicy paste?</font>

824
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:45,647
<font color="yellow">We will add sesame oil and eggs. It sounds delicious.</font>

825
00:54:49,647 --> 00:54:52,347
<font color="yellow">By the way, where did Chang Soo go?</font>

826
00:55:12,617 --> 00:55:14,147
<font color="yellow">It's because you eat like this...</font>

827
00:55:14,647 --> 00:55:16,347
<font color="yellow">you weigh more than 120kg.</font>

828
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:17,887
<font color="yellow">Lose some weight.</font>

829
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:19,587
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

830
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,717
<font color="yellow">Don't talk to me because I'm hungry.</font>

831
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,947
<font color="yellow">If you are going to get fat like a pig, then study.</font>

832
00:55:31,217 --> 00:55:34,287
<font color="yellow">If you aren't going to study, be slim and handsome.</font>

833
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:36,447
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

834
00:55:37,317 --> 00:55:38,787
<font color="yellow">Eat a lot and get fat.</font>

835
00:55:40,247 --> 00:55:41,347
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

836
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:43,987
<font color="yellow">You little...</font>

837
00:55:44,317 --> 00:55:45,447
<font color="yellow">Han Chang Soo.</font>

838
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:48,987
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

839
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:55,417
<font color="yellow">You, two.</font>

840
00:55:55,887 --> 00:55:58,147
<font color="yellow">Who are you? What class are you in?</font>

841
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:02,347
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking on him? He hasn't done anything to you.</font>

842
00:56:03,647 --> 00:56:04,687
<font color="yellow">Are you thugs?</font>

843
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:09,917
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get scolded from me?</font>

844
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:11,487
<font color="yellow">Hey, let's go.</font>

845
00:56:14,147 --> 00:56:15,547
<font color="yellow">Who's your homeroom teacher?</font>

846
00:56:15,717 --> 00:56:18,617
<font color="yellow">I will pay your teacher a visit. I won't let this go.</font>

847
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:27,517
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

848
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:29,017
<font color="yellow">Follow me.</font>

849
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:42,047
<font color="yellow">Give me all of your money. Hurry.</font>

850
00:56:46,347 --> 00:56:47,347
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

851
00:56:47,917 --> 00:56:50,787
<font color="yellow">I can't survive with a single bean.</font>

852
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,087
<font color="yellow">From now on, you don't have any allowance.</font>

853
00:56:54,817 --> 00:56:57,447
<font color="yellow">Until you lose weight, live without money.</font>

854
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:58,947
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Shut it.</font>

855
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:01,587
<font color="yellow">Sit down.</font>

856
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:09,347
<font color="yellow">Out of all the desires you have as a human,</font>

857
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:11,917
<font color="yellow">is eating your only desire?</font>

858
00:57:12,287 --> 00:57:15,017
<font color="yellow">Then what other desires would I have?</font>

859
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:17,947
<font color="yellow">The desire to be acknowledged and to be loved.</font>

860
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:20,887
<font color="yellow">Don't you have confidence or self-esteem?</font>

861
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:23,647
<font color="yellow">I'm always hungry that I can't think about those things.</font>

862
00:57:24,117 --> 00:57:25,687
<font color="yellow">You need to bear it.</font>

863
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:28,717
<font color="yellow">You need to endure the hunger and the difficulty.</font>

864
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:30,987
<font color="yellow">That's how a person grows up.</font>

865
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:33,847
<font color="yellow">Also, why are you so prone...</font>

866
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,547
<font color="yellow">to hit others that easily?</font>

867
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:38,787
<font color="yellow">They started it first. You saw it, too.</font>

868
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:40,347
<font color="yellow">But still.</font>

869
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:44,987
<font color="yellow">Don't you know whoever swings first is at a disadvantage?</font>

870
00:57:44,987 --> 00:57:47,017
<font color="yellow">They keep bullying me.</font>

871
00:57:47,017 --> 00:57:50,517
<font color="yellow">Why do you let them get into your head?</font>

872
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:54,387
<font color="yellow">I can't help but to swing first when I'm angry.</font>

873
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:58,347
<font color="yellow">- I'm sorry. - No, you shouldn't be.</font>

874
00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:01,347
<font color="yellow">This isn't on you.</font>

875
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:03,647
<font color="yellow">This is all because of...</font>

876
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,947
<font color="yellow">lack of the humanities.</font>

877
00:58:06,387 --> 00:58:08,617
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? Lack of what?</font>

878
00:58:08,787 --> 00:58:10,117
<font color="yellow">The humanities.</font>

879
00:58:11,047 --> 00:58:12,717
<font color="yellow">The difference between people and animals...</font>

880
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:15,517
<font color="yellow">is that people can think deeply...</font>

881
00:58:15,547 --> 00:58:17,117
<font color="yellow">and can express it verbally.</font>

882
00:58:17,487 --> 00:58:19,947
<font color="yellow">In 1995, after there was a wave...</font>

883
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,247
<font color="yellow">of the humanities in the States,</font>

884
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:24,017
<font color="yellow">all the troubled children...</font>

885
00:58:24,347 --> 00:58:26,817
<font color="yellow">found a way to express their feelings...</font>

886
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:30,887
<font color="yellow">without swinging their fist.</font>

887
00:58:32,787 --> 00:58:33,887
<font color="yellow">Books over bread.</font>

888
00:58:34,347 --> 00:58:37,047
<font color="yellow">Art history over curses. Instead of their fist,</font>

889
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:40,087
<font color="yellow">the children started to study philosophical reason of life.</font>

890
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:42,147
<font color="yellow">After that,</font>

891
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:44,317
<font color="yellow">they began to change.</font>

892
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,787
<font color="yellow">Excuse me? Why did they change?</font>

893
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:51,917
<font color="yellow">This isn't acceptable. Starting today,</font>

894
00:58:53,047 --> 00:58:55,287
<font color="yellow">you will study about Shakespeare.</font>

895
00:58:55,687 --> 00:58:57,847
<font color="yellow">What? Shakespeare?</font>

896
00:58:58,817 --> 00:59:00,417
<font color="yellow">Who is Shakespeare?</font>

897
00:59:04,647 --> 00:59:05,887
<font color="yellow">Who does he do?</font>

898
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:07,917
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

899
00:59:08,847 --> 00:59:12,417
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik really said those things?</font>

900
00:59:12,747 --> 00:59:15,787
<font color="yellow">Yes, he did. It broke my heart.</font>

901
00:59:15,887 --> 00:59:17,147
<font color="yellow">Where is Hyung Seop?</font>

902
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:20,387
<font color="yellow">He must have felt disappointed. He went for a hike.</font>

903
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,817
<font color="yellow">Of course, he must have. That's enough to disappoint him.</font>

904
00:59:22,817 --> 00:59:24,947
<font color="yellow">You know how he raised them.</font>

905
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:27,187
<font color="yellow">With his salary, he raised four children.</font>

906
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:30,117
<font color="yellow">He sent them to colleges and married them off.</font>

907
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:33,847
<font color="yellow">He did his best raising them. How can he say those ungrateful things?</font>

908
00:59:33,947 --> 00:59:36,487
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I'm going to talk to him. Is he home?</font>

909
00:59:36,617 --> 00:59:37,717
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

910
00:59:38,347 --> 00:59:40,187
<font color="yellow">He went out early in the morning.</font>

911
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:43,647
<font color="yellow">Lock the door so he can't come in.</font>

912
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:46,617
<font color="yellow">Do you think he can't come in because I lock the door?</font>

913
00:59:47,047 --> 00:59:50,187
<font color="yellow">This is why we shouldn't have been nice to our children.</font>

914
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:55,047
<font color="yellow">This is how he treats us. We raised, clothed, fed, and educated him.</font>

915
00:59:55,847 --> 00:59:59,087
<font color="yellow">We even let him stay on the first floor. I don't even know...</font>

916
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,887
<font color="yellow">what else he wants that desperately to talk to us like that.</font>

917
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:08,447
<font color="yellow">Are you crying because of that?</font>

918
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,117
<font color="yellow">This is breaking my heart, Mother.</font>

919
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:12,947
<font color="yellow">What a punk.</font>

920
01:00:13,517 --> 01:00:15,887
<font color="yellow">When he comes home, I'm going to kill him.</font>

921
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:22,187
<font color="yellow">To be honest, your script is good.</font>

922
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,347
<font color="yellow">It's tightly constructed and the characters are vivid.</font>

923
01:00:25,547 --> 01:00:26,787
<font color="yellow">I feel as if the characters are real.</font>

924
01:00:27,947 --> 01:00:29,047
<font color="yellow">However,</font>

925
01:00:29,647 --> 01:00:33,247
<font color="yellow">do you think they need to go home before midnight like Cinderella?</font>

926
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:35,947
<font color="yellow">What do you mean by that?</font>

927
01:00:35,987 --> 01:00:39,447
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you to let loose. Don't restrict yourself.</font>

928
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:43,717
<font color="yellow">When I look at your script, I can see you in it.</font>

929
01:00:45,147 --> 01:00:47,517
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you confident about love?</font>

930
01:00:47,517 --> 01:00:49,917
<font color="yellow">You told me you can love confidently in your writing.</font>

931
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:54,317
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

932
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,417
<font color="yellow">Like I told you before, you have to change the title.</font>

933
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,047
<font color="yellow">As you revise your script little by little,</font>

934
01:01:01,287 --> 01:01:03,347
<font color="yellow">you will think of a title you like.</font>

935
01:01:04,447 --> 01:01:05,587
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

936
01:01:07,817 --> 01:01:09,887
<font color="yellow">By the way, there is...</font>

937
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:12,517
<font color="yellow">a book in my room that would be helpful for you.</font>

938
01:01:40,547 --> 01:01:41,887
<font color="yellow">Who can it be at this hour?</font>

939
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:44,147
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure. Who is it?</font>

940
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:52,087
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Who are you?</font>

941
01:01:52,187 --> 01:01:54,947
<font color="yellow">Hello. My name is Bang Mi Joo.</font>

942
01:01:55,347 --> 01:01:57,117
<font color="yellow">Look who it is.</font>

943
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:00,247
<font color="yellow">You're Seong Joon's girlfriend who was here the last time.</font>

944
01:02:00,787 --> 01:02:03,117
<font color="yellow">- What? - Yes. How have you been?</font>

945
01:02:03,117 --> 01:02:05,847
<font color="yellow">I've been great. Please come in.</font>

946
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:08,147
<font color="yellow">You said you'd visit again, and you really did.</font>

947
01:02:09,617 --> 01:02:12,947
<font color="yellow">Say hello. She's Seong Joon's mom.</font>

948
01:02:13,517 --> 01:02:16,417
<font color="yellow">- Oh, I see. Hello. - Hi.</font>

949
01:02:16,617 --> 01:02:18,487
<font color="yellow">- Welcome. - These are for you.</font>

950
01:02:18,687 --> 01:02:20,517
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Thank you.</font>

951
01:02:20,717 --> 01:02:23,387
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Jeong Ae. Where is Seong Joon?</font>

952
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:27,447
<font color="yellow">He went to the rooftop to do something with Dong Hui.</font>

953
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:31,147
<font color="yellow">You should go and tell him to hurry downstairs. His girlfriend is here.</font>

954
01:02:31,287 --> 01:02:33,247
<font color="yellow">What is he doing with Dong Hui?</font>

955
01:02:33,347 --> 01:02:34,847
<font color="yellow">Please come inside.</font>

956
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:37,987
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Goodness.</font>

957
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:39,817
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat here.</font>

958
01:02:42,047 --> 01:02:44,447
<font color="yellow">- Did you say your name was Mi Joo? - Yes.</font>

959
01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:46,387
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're so pretty.</font>

960
01:02:46,987 --> 01:02:48,217
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

961
01:02:48,817 --> 01:02:51,287
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Call Seong Joon.</font>

962
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:52,917
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

963
01:02:55,917 --> 01:02:57,417
<font color="yellow">Mom. We're here.</font>

964
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:07,887
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. Hi.</font>

965
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,087
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

966
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:14,587
<font color="yellow">What were you doing with Dong Hui? Didn't you know she was coming?</font>

967
01:03:14,847 --> 01:03:18,687
<font color="yellow">No. I just wanted to meet Seong Joon's parents so badly.</font>

968
01:03:18,747 --> 01:03:21,587
<font color="yellow">I just came here to give you new year's greeting. He didn't know.</font>

969
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:24,187
<font color="yellow">Hello, Dong Hui.</font>

970
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:27,447
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

971
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:29,917
<font color="yellow">Do you and Dong Hui know each other?</font>

972
01:03:30,187 --> 01:03:32,617
<font color="yellow">Of course. She works at our company.</font>

973
01:03:34,187 --> 01:03:35,487
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Really?</font>

974
01:03:36,217 --> 01:03:40,187
<font color="yellow">Well... I should go upstairs now. Goodbye.</font>

975
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:01,047
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're a director?</font>

976
01:04:01,517 --> 01:04:03,947
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's right.</font>

977
01:04:04,317 --> 01:04:05,887
<font color="yellow">Her father is the chairman.</font>

978
01:04:06,647 --> 01:04:08,917
<font color="yellow">- Goodness, Seong Joon. - Mom.</font>

979
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:12,947
<font color="yellow">But Seong Joon has helped me a lot since I was a new employee,</font>

980
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:15,287
<font color="yellow">so I listen to everything he says.</font>

981
01:04:15,947 --> 01:04:17,587
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - Charming men...</font>

982
01:04:17,847 --> 01:04:21,117
<font color="yellow">are those who have a firm hand.</font>

983
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:23,817
<font color="yellow">Do you have any siblings?</font>

984
01:04:24,147 --> 01:04:27,517
<font color="yellow">I'm an only child. I felt lonely growing up without any siblings,</font>

985
01:04:27,787 --> 01:04:29,617
<font color="yellow">so I was jealous when I heard...</font>

986
01:04:29,847 --> 01:04:32,447
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon had two brothers and cousins.</font>

987
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:36,887
<font color="yellow">I see. How long have you been seeing each other?</font>

988
01:04:37,117 --> 01:04:39,747
<font color="yellow">We've known each other for five years,</font>

989
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:42,617
<font color="yellow">and we've been dating for three years.</font>

990
01:04:43,817 --> 01:04:46,487
<font color="yellow">- You should get married now, then. - Grandma.</font>

991
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:48,847
<font color="yellow">My father is also...</font>

992
01:04:48,917 --> 01:04:51,787
<font color="yellow">watching Seong Joon carefully as his successor.</font>

993
01:04:52,117 --> 01:04:53,347
<font color="yellow">Oh, my.</font>

994
01:04:54,087 --> 01:04:56,617
<font color="yellow">You still can't take away my dear Seong Joon.</font>

995
01:04:56,887 --> 01:05:00,017
<font color="yellow">Of course. I'll move out of my house myself.</font>

996
01:05:00,947 --> 01:05:03,747
<font color="yellow">No need to discuss. You should get married now. It'd be perfect.</font>

997
01:05:04,187 --> 01:05:08,147
<font color="yellow">Since his brothers got married, there haven't been any weddings.</font>

998
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:11,087
<font color="yellow">Now it's time to have one.</font>

999
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:14,217
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae. How long has it been since we had a new family member?</font>

1000
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:17,787
<font color="yellow">It's been 16 years because Chang Soo and Ji Hoon are 15.</font>

1001
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:20,917
<font color="yellow">But Mother. I just met her.</font>

1002
01:05:20,987 --> 01:05:23,187
<font color="yellow">Talking about their wedding must be uncomfortable for her, too.</font>

1003
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,447
<font color="yellow">No, it's not. I met my husband...</font>

1004
01:05:25,517 --> 01:05:28,847
<font color="yellow">for the first time at the wedding, but we had a wonderful marriage.</font>

1005
01:05:30,287 --> 01:05:31,747
<font color="yellow">Really? Oh, my.</font>

1006
01:05:33,287 --> 01:05:35,587
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Mom. She should go now.</font>

1007
01:05:35,787 --> 01:05:37,287
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry she visited so abruptly.</font>

1008
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,047
<font color="yellow">- Why should she go? - I'm sorry.</font>

1009
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:42,287
<font color="yellow">Come on, Mi Joo. You should go.</font>

1010
01:05:47,017 --> 01:05:49,217
<font color="yellow">I actually have things to do.</font>

1011
01:05:49,347 --> 01:05:51,047
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you again next time.</font>

1012
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:52,987
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll see you next time.</font>

1013
01:05:53,187 --> 01:05:55,847
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner together, then.</font>

1014
01:05:56,117 --> 01:05:59,987
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon's dad isn't home right now.</font>

1015
01:05:59,987 --> 01:06:01,647
<font color="yellow">The rest of the family isn't, either.</font>

1016
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,087
<font color="yellow">Okay, Grandmother. I'll see you next time, Mother.</font>

1017
01:06:05,247 --> 01:06:06,717
<font color="yellow">All right. Goodbye.</font>

1018
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:08,787
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed that you're leaving so soon.</font>

1019
01:06:09,687 --> 01:06:11,287
<font color="yellow">I'll see her off.</font>

1020
01:06:11,817 --> 01:06:12,817
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

1021
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:21,917
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

1022
01:06:26,887 --> 01:06:29,487
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I'm going to go now.</font>

1023
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:36,917
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

1024
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:46,417
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Please cut me some slack.</font>

1025
01:06:47,147 --> 01:06:49,487
<font color="yellow">What am I supposed to do? I just like you so much.</font>

1026
01:06:50,087 --> 01:06:51,617
<font color="yellow">That's why I went to your house.</font>

1027
01:06:51,817 --> 01:06:55,187
<font color="yellow">I know it's mean and humiliating, but I went anyway.</font>

1028
01:07:10,887 --> 01:07:12,087
<font color="yellow">I told you before.</font>

1029
01:07:13,287 --> 01:07:14,547
<font color="yellow">I don't love you.</font>

1030
01:07:14,847 --> 01:07:16,917
<font color="yellow">You're wrong. You can love me.</font>

1031
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,887
<font color="yellow">You'll just have to try.</font>

1032
01:07:20,387 --> 01:07:21,387
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo.</font>

1033
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:24,217
<font color="yellow">I can't give you up. Never.</font>

1034
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:27,387
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

1035
01:07:28,547 --> 01:07:29,747
<font color="yellow">Do you think...</font>

1036
01:07:31,387 --> 01:07:32,817
<font color="yellow">you can try to love someone?</font>

1037
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,987
<font color="yellow">During those five years that we've spent together,</font>

1038
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,647
<font color="yellow">I found you beautiful,</font>

1039
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:41,987
<font color="yellow">and reliable at times.</font>

1040
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:45,117
<font color="yellow">Sometimes I felt comfortable around you like we're friends.</font>

1041
01:07:46,847 --> 01:07:48,417
<font color="yellow">But while we were seeing each other,</font>

1042
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:51,747
<font color="yellow">I always felt a burden on my heart.</font>

1043
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:54,917
<font color="yellow">It felt uncomfortable like you aren't really mine.</font>

1044
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,747
<font color="yellow">It confused me.</font>

1045
01:08:01,687 --> 01:08:03,887
<font color="yellow">That confusion made us come to this far.</font>

1046
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:06,387
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

1047
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:11,487
<font color="yellow">I sincerely apologize.</font>

1048
01:08:17,517 --> 01:08:18,517
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

1049
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:22,687
<font color="yellow">I can't love you just because I'm sorry.</font>

1050
01:08:23,217 --> 01:08:26,117
<font color="yellow">I can't marry you just because I'm sorry.</font>

1051
01:08:28,257 --> 01:08:31,287
<font color="yellow">It'd be deceiving myself, and it will also be bad for...</font>

1052
01:08:55,617 --> 01:08:57,517
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1053
01:08:57,787 --> 01:08:59,617
<font color="yellow">How did he become so smart all of a sudden?</font>

1054
01:08:59,617 --> 01:09:02,187
<font color="yellow">- We study now. Let's go, Chang Soo. - Okay.</font>

1055
01:09:02,547 --> 01:09:04,547
<font color="yellow">When Seong Joon gets married,</font>

1056
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:06,547
<font color="yellow">his mother will come, right?</font>

1057
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:10,087
<font color="yellow">I just thought it'd be good to have rich parents when things are hard.</font>

1058
01:09:10,087 --> 01:09:12,347
<font color="yellow">Dad devoted his whole life for us,</font>

1059
01:09:12,347 --> 01:09:13,647
<font color="yellow">and now you're calling him humble?</font>

1060
01:09:13,687 --> 01:09:16,287
<font color="yellow">Be careful. You can't get swayed now.</font>

1061
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:19,047
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go out with me?</font>
