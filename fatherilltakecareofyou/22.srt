1
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:10,346
<font color="yellow">That night, I went to Han River...</font>

2
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,046
<font color="yellow">to do some night fishing.</font>

3
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:14,606
<font color="yellow">I couldn't catch any fish,</font>

4
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:16,776
<font color="yellow">and it kept getting cold.</font>

5
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:19,146
<font color="yellow">So I wrapped up early and headed home.</font>

6
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:26,606
<font color="yellow">On the way, I saw a crying boy.</font>

7
00:00:28,306 --> 00:00:30,776
<font color="yellow">I looked around, but there was no adult.</font>

8
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:33,646
<font color="yellow">It was very late, too.</font>

9
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,275
<font color="yellow">Brother.</font>

10
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:37,046
<font color="yellow">He was wearing only a thin jacket.</font>

11
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,576
<font color="yellow">He was wearing shoes, but he
wasn't wearing any socks.</font>

12
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:43,045
<font color="yellow">I thought it was strange, so I asked him.</font>

13
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:44,176
<font color="yellow">Darling.</font>

14
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:46,706
<font color="yellow">Why are you crying?</font>

15
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,406
<font color="yellow">Did you lose your mother?</font>

16
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:53,475
<font color="yellow">Then he suddenly cried,</font>

17
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:54,946
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

18
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,406
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

19
00:00:57,846 --> 00:01:00,606
<font color="yellow">Brother!</font>

20
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:01,906
<font color="yellow">He was calling...</font>

21
00:01:02,446 --> 00:01:05,006
<font color="yellow">his brother so sadly.</font>

22
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:48,346
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

23
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:50,646
<font color="yellow">Did you say Golden Street
is still in business?</font>

24
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,106
<font color="yellow">That's not possible.</font>

25
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:57,306
<font color="yellow">He lost everything.</font>

26
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:58,906
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you are mistaken.</font>

27
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:09,105
<font color="yellow">Okay. Take care.</font>

28
00:02:09,106 --> 00:02:10,516
<font color="yellow">Congratulations on your marriage.</font>

29
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:24,306
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

30
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:30,776
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

31
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,276
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong?</font>

32
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:02,706
<font color="yellow">Who is...</font>

33
00:03:03,546 --> 00:03:04,776
<font color="yellow">your uncle, Jeong Eun?</font>

34
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:07,476
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

35
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,106
<font color="yellow">My uncle?</font>

36
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,146
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask that?</font>

37
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,106
<font color="yellow">He's too different...</font>

38
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:18,206
<font color="yellow">from the one I know.</font>

39
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:26,446
<font color="yellow">Who is my uncle you know?</font>

40
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,176
<font color="yellow">Did you know...</font>

41
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,946
<font color="yellow">my uncle even before?</font>

42
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:37,976
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

43
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:39,876
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

44
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,006
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

45
00:03:42,146 --> 00:03:44,276
<font color="yellow">Are you curious about my uncle now?</font>

46
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,946
<font color="yellow">You were curious about Seong Joon
last time, and it's my uncle now.</font>

47
00:03:48,346 --> 00:03:50,646
<font color="yellow">Why are you so curious
about my family, Hyun Woo?</font>

48
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:57,446
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to tell me?</font>

49
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,076
<font color="yellow">Is it a secret again?</font>

50
00:04:08,506 --> 00:04:10,006
<font color="yellow">My uncle is...</font>

51
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,176
<font color="yellow">a really nice person.</font>

52
00:04:12,646 --> 00:04:15,506
<font color="yellow">He's the man who would
live even without the law.</font>

53
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:20,375
<font color="yellow">He gives his everything to his children,</font>

54
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:22,336
<font color="yellow">and for that he gets into
a conflict with my aunt.</font>

55
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:23,746
<font color="yellow">But I've never...</font>

56
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,816
<font color="yellow">seen someone greater and
nicer than my uncle.</font>

57
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,406
<font color="yellow">Is that enough?</font>

58
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,176
<font color="yellow">Don't be upset.</font>

59
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,846
<font color="yellow">I apologize...</font>

60
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,446
<font color="yellow">about what happened that night.</font>

61
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:41,605
<font color="yellow">I'm really curious about what
happened on that night...</font>

62
00:04:41,606 --> 00:04:43,926
<font color="yellow">and about why you came and had
a conflict with Seong Joon.</font>

63
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,746
<font color="yellow">But I won't ask anymore.</font>

64
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:53,476
<font color="yellow">Instead,</font>

65
00:04:55,246 --> 00:04:57,176
<font color="yellow">like I always told you,</font>

66
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:01,076
<font color="yellow">please tell me when you want to.</font>

67
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:03,076
<font color="yellow">I will wait.</font>

68
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:11,246
<font color="yellow">Eat. I got you coffee and
cucumber sandwich as always.</font>

69
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:14,006
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

70
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:16,316
<font color="yellow">What would you like?</font>

71
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:21,346
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll prepare a cup of warm Americano.</font>

72
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:24,406
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little.</font>

73
00:05:53,846 --> 00:05:55,645
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Sir.
- Hello.</font>

74
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,206
<font color="yellow">- You're well, right?
- Yes. Thank you.</font>

75
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:03,676
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Hello.</font>

76
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:05,546
<font color="yellow">Hello, Min Ji.</font>

77
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:06,946
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

78
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,706
<font color="yellow">Tell him where you're going.</font>

79
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:10,106
<font color="yellow">We're going to a theme park.</font>

80
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,406
<font color="yellow">You must be excited.</font>

81
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:15,575
<font color="yellow">Get yourself something good. Have fun.</font>

82
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:17,476
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to do that.</font>

83
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,906
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

84
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:22,105
<font color="yellow">- Say thank you.
- Thank you.</font>

85
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:23,176
<font color="yellow">You're so adorable.</font>

86
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:26,546
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

87
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:42,106
<font color="yellow">- Sir.
- He's a nasty and cheap man.</font>

88
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:45,946
<font color="yellow">A man like him could not
have raised my brother.</font>

89
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:52,076
<font color="yellow">He destroyed another person's
family for his family.</font>

90
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,776
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't have raised the son of
the man who almost killed his sons.</font>

91
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,806
<font color="yellow">You have to think rationally.</font>

92
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:02,576
<font color="yellow">We don't know yet that Han
Seong Joon is your brother.</font>

93
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,346
<font color="yellow">23 years ago,</font>

94
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:07,746
<font color="yellow">he looked straight into my eyes.</font>

95
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:12,176
<font color="yellow">Crying while holding my dad
who was lying on the floor,</font>

96
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:15,446
<font color="yellow">I looked at him with eyes
filled with resentment.</font>

97
00:07:17,546 --> 00:07:18,576
<font color="yellow">And he...</font>

98
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:21,676
<font color="yellow">looked straight into my eyes too.</font>

99
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,946
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

100
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,276
<font color="yellow">if Seong Joon is your brother,</font>

101
00:07:28,606 --> 00:07:30,106
<font color="yellow">it will be a good thing.</font>

102
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,376
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon is not Sang Woo.</font>

103
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:37,246
<font color="yellow">You saw how he treated me.</font>

104
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,006
<font color="yellow">If he's Sang Woo,</font>

105
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,346
<font color="yellow">he would have recognized me.</font>

106
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:46,406
<font color="yellow">You heard the man who took
Sang Woo to the police.</font>

107
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:49,346
<font color="yellow">He was calling for his
brother, not his mother.</font>

108
00:07:51,006 --> 00:07:52,076
<font color="yellow">There's no way...</font>

109
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,076
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo wouldn't recognize me.</font>

110
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:59,646
<font color="yellow">But I still hope Seong Joon...</font>

111
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:01,246
<font color="yellow">turns out to be Sang Woo.</font>

112
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:06,406
<font color="yellow">It would be a good thing
that he grew well...</font>

113
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:08,506
<font color="yellow">like Seong Joon.</font>

114
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:13,546
<font color="yellow">You have to remain cold at times like this.</font>

115
00:08:14,176 --> 00:08:17,876
<font color="yellow">I requested the police for the case record.</font>

116
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,676
<font color="yellow">Everything will become clear soon.</font>

117
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:35,506
<font color="yellow">I told you I'm not David Lee.</font>

118
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,546
<font color="yellow">So why do you spread rumors?</font>

119
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,376
<font color="yellow">Do you want to get hurt?</font>

120
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,006
<font color="yellow">You are right.</font>

121
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:44,306
<font color="yellow">I lost everything.</font>

122
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,146
<font color="yellow">Every penny I had.</font>

123
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:51,946
<font color="yellow">Will you be at the construction
site all day tomorrow, Sir?</font>

124
00:08:52,276 --> 00:08:54,876
<font color="yellow">Yes. If nothing special comes up.</font>

125
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:01,676
<font color="yellow">What do you like about Hyun Woo?</font>

126
00:09:03,506 --> 00:09:06,946
<font color="yellow">I don't think he's such a good person.</font>

127
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,376
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is killing me.</font>

128
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:22,946
<font color="yellow">My goodness, it's so heavy. My back hurts.</font>

129
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,306
<font color="yellow">Mother. Are you okay?</font>

130
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:28,446
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not okay. I thought my
arms were going to fall off.</font>

131
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,745
<font color="yellow">We have so many people in our family.</font>

132
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,945
<font color="yellow">Why do we have to buy groceries
for the holidays by ourselves?</font>

133
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:35,975
<font color="yellow">Where did all the men in this family go?</font>

134
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,306
<font color="yellow">None of them volunteered
to carry these for us.</font>

135
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:40,646
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

136
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:44,606
<font color="yellow">Where on earth have you been?</font>

137
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,146
<font color="yellow">- You're home, Father.
- Yes.</font>

138
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:50,145
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Why are you yelling at me?</font>

139
00:09:50,146 --> 00:09:51,646
<font color="yellow">I just went hiking.</font>

140
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:55,946
<font color="yellow">Did you have to go today? We had
to buy groceries for the holidays.</font>

141
00:09:57,076 --> 00:10:00,576
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had to
buy the groceries today.</font>

142
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:01,646
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?</font>

143
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,446
<font color="yellow">The holidays are marked on the calendar.</font>

144
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,545
<font color="yellow">You should have thought
to stay home and help me.</font>

145
00:10:08,546 --> 00:10:09,916
<font color="yellow">That's what you should have done.</font>

146
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,546
<font color="yellow">Father, Mother. Give it to me. I'll do it.</font>

147
00:10:13,276 --> 00:10:15,176
<font color="yellow">Why would I look at the calendar?</font>

148
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,376
<font color="yellow">It only makes me upset
that I'm getting old.</font>

149
00:10:17,676 --> 00:10:19,106
<font color="yellow">You always make up excuses.</font>

150
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:21,875
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to move those things?</font>

151
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,006
<font color="yellow">Father, please leave them. I'll do it.</font>

152
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:28,446
<font color="yellow">Hurry and bring them over here.</font>

153
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,846
<font color="yellow">I'll help you, Hye Joo. You came
home early from work today.</font>

154
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,176
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

155
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:38,576
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

156
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:42,916
<font color="yellow">Let Hyung Seop do it. You should go
downstairs. Hee Sook said she was...</font>

157
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:46,205
<font color="yellow">going to Chang Soo's school. If
she's back, bring her up here.</font>

158
00:10:46,206 --> 00:10:47,946
<font color="yellow">It will take a long time to
just organize all these.</font>

159
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,276
<font color="yellow">Okay, Mother. I will.</font>

160
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,676
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo has an unbelievable talent.</font>

161
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:03,446
<font color="yellow">- What?
- He's got the qualities of...</font>

162
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,746
<font color="yellow">top 0.001 percent as an opera singer.</font>

163
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:08,546
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

164
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,606
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

165
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:16,406
<font color="yellow">Did you say top 0.001 percent?</font>

166
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,746
<font color="yellow">He has an amazing and powerful voice.</font>

167
00:11:19,176 --> 00:11:22,806
<font color="yellow">Especially, we call the singer's
body "sound box" in vocal music.</font>

168
00:11:23,306 --> 00:11:25,676
<font color="yellow">His body is three times
bigger than other students.</font>

169
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,445
<font color="yellow">Having a body like Chang Soo's is...</font>

170
00:11:28,446 --> 00:11:30,906
<font color="yellow">the same as having the
best musical instrument.</font>

171
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:42,946
<font color="yellow">Look at that. Hee Sook.</font>

172
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:45,906
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

173
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,276
<font color="yellow">Your aged mother-in-law...</font>

174
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:52,006
<font color="yellow">and I, your sister-in-law who
will soon reach menopause,</font>

175
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,575
<font color="yellow">worked so hard to buy the
groceries for the holidays.</font>

176
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,106
<font color="yellow">You're a young woman.</font>

177
00:11:57,246 --> 00:12:00,446
<font color="yellow">You're actually the youngest one.
Why are you just sitting here?</font>

178
00:12:03,506 --> 00:12:04,646
<font color="yellow">Look, Hee Sook.</font>

179
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,946
<font color="yellow">Hey! Should I teach you some lesson again?</font>

180
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:11,446
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

181
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,776
<font color="yellow">Why are you looking at me like that?
You look scary.</font>

182
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,306
<font color="yellow">- Hey! What are you doing?
- Just come here.</font>

183
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,806
<font color="yellow">Why did you drag me down
here to tell me something?</font>

184
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,406
<font color="yellow">We have a big problem.</font>

185
00:12:29,176 --> 00:12:31,246
<font color="yellow">What? What's the problem? What is it?</font>

186
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:33,976
<font color="yellow">Did they say our sons
haven't been switched?</font>

187
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:38,546
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. That's something
I really hope for.</font>

188
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,576
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what is it?</font>

189
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:48,076
<font color="yellow">Please keep this to yourself for now.</font>

190
00:12:49,106 --> 00:12:51,406
<font color="yellow">- Chang Soo...
- Chang Soo?</font>

191
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:54,346
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo... I mean...</font>

192
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,976
<font color="yellow">I found out that Chang Soo has...</font>

193
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,246
<font color="yellow">an amazing talent.</font>

194
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,876
<font color="yellow">- A talent?
- Yes.</font>

195
00:13:04,176 --> 00:13:06,576
<font color="yellow">Does he have a talent?
Is it related to food?</font>

196
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,246
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Hye Joo.</font>

197
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:10,646
<font color="yellow">You're underestimating your former son.</font>

198
00:13:11,446 --> 00:13:15,176
<font color="yellow">Come on. It just feels too
awkward to hear all this.</font>

199
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:20,046
<font color="yellow">I just can't put together the
word "talent" and Chang Soo.</font>

200
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:23,746
<font color="yellow">That doesn't matter. What kind
of a talent does he have?</font>

201
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:26,076
<font color="yellow">For music.</font>

202
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:29,446
<font color="yellow">- For music?
- It's even classical music.</font>

203
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,806
<font color="yellow">What? Did you say classical music?</font>

204
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:35,006
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right!</font>

205
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,746
<font color="yellow">My goodness! You just spat on me.</font>

206
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,376
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo and classical music?</font>

207
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:54,306
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

208
00:13:55,676 --> 00:13:58,306
<font color="yellow">What classical music? Is it...</font>

209
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,676
<font color="yellow">a giant drum?</font>

210
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,446
<font color="yellow">Castanets?</font>

211
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:10,046
<font color="yellow">Or cymbals?</font>

212
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,506
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Is that how much...</font>

213
00:14:14,676 --> 00:14:17,676
<font color="yellow">you value your former son?</font>

214
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:21,776
<font color="yellow">No. That's not what I meant.</font>

215
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:25,606
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have a talent for music,
let alone for classical music.</font>

216
00:14:26,276 --> 00:14:29,845
<font color="yellow">My husband and I don't know a
thing about classical music.</font>

217
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:32,575
<font color="yellow">You and your husband also don't know
anything about classical music.</font>

218
00:14:32,576 --> 00:14:34,946
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm saying this, okay?</font>

219
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,846
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo has potential to
become an opera singer.</font>

220
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:41,446
<font color="yellow">An opera singer?</font>

221
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,346
<font color="yellow">He's even got qualities of a top
0.001 percent opera singer.</font>

222
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:48,576
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

223
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,606
<font color="yellow">Who said that?</font>

224
00:14:50,776 --> 00:14:52,946
<font color="yellow">The music teacher at Chang Soo's school.</font>

225
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:57,276
<font color="yellow">He asked me to come to the
school, and told me about this.</font>

226
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:58,806
<font color="yellow">Is that true?</font>

227
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,676
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you it is.
Anyway, whom should we...</font>

228
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:05,576
<font color="yellow">consult with regarding this matter?</font>

229
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,326
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to ask.</font>

230
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,676
<font color="yellow">Do you know anyone who
studies classical music?</font>

231
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:15,046
<font color="yellow">Wait. Let me think.</font>

232
00:15:17,846 --> 00:15:18,846
<font color="yellow">Who can there be?</font>

233
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:23,346
<font color="yellow">All the people I know are office workers.</font>

234
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,406
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon's friends are all reporters.</font>

235
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,806
<font color="yellow">Your husband's friends are all lawyers.</font>

236
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,346
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

237
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,446
<font color="yellow">- You're just a housewife.
- Stop.</font>

238
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:38,646
<font color="yellow">There is no one. What should we do?</font>

239
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:41,846
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo!</font>

240
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,076
<font color="yellow">What? What is it?</font>

241
00:15:45,146 --> 00:15:48,876
<font color="yellow">Do you know Mr. Jeong Myung
Hoon's phone number?</font>

242
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,046
<font color="yellow">- Hey!
- My goodness.</font>

243
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,546
<font color="yellow">What's all this?</font>

244
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,146
<font color="yellow">I can't believe her.</font>

245
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,576
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ae Ri.</font>

246
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:16,276
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri!</font>

247
00:16:28,346 --> 00:16:29,646
<font color="yellow">You're here, Mom.</font>

248
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:33,146
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

249
00:16:43,446 --> 00:16:45,346
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

250
00:16:45,576 --> 00:16:47,646
<font color="yellow">How many bottles of wine have you had?</font>

251
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:51,646
<font color="yellow">- Did you finish them all today?
- No.</font>

252
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,106
<font color="yellow">In three days.</font>

253
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,306
<font color="yellow">Are you saying you've been
drinking like this for three days?</font>

254
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,006
<font color="yellow">Yes. Gosh, this feels good.</font>

255
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,806
<font color="yellow">This is why artists should
do nothing but practice art.</font>

256
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:10,646
<font color="yellow">They would be fools to love
someone or have children.</font>

257
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:13,846
<font color="yellow">They are the most happy
when they do nothing...</font>

258
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,876
<font color="yellow">but perform art all day every day.</font>

259
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:18,006
<font color="yellow">Will you stop drinking?</font>

260
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:21,776
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to drive me insane?</font>

261
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:24,006
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

262
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:27,676
<font color="yellow">You should think about it.</font>

263
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,406
<font color="yellow">I don't even have...</font>

264
00:17:30,846 --> 00:17:33,076
<font color="yellow">a husband at this age.</font>

265
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:37,806
<font color="yellow">My only daughter doesn't listen to me,</font>

266
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:41,446
<font color="yellow">and I couldn't become a
world-class pianist.</font>

267
00:17:42,546 --> 00:17:43,906
<font color="yellow">How ridiculous.</font>

268
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:47,406
<font color="yellow">My life is totally empty.</font>

269
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,616
<font color="yellow">The only thing I can do is drink.</font>

270
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:54,146
<font color="yellow">- Don't you think, Mom?
- Stop drinking!</font>

271
00:17:55,906 --> 00:17:56,946
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri.</font>

272
00:17:57,406 --> 00:18:01,376
<font color="yellow">No one stopped you from
becoming a world-class pianist.</font>

273
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:04,506
<font color="yellow">You couldn't study abroad, and
you became a single mother...</font>

274
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:08,876
<font color="yellow">because you met that jerk and got pregnant.</font>

275
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,645
<font color="yellow">It's not because I told
you to live like this.</font>

276
00:18:11,646 --> 00:18:13,206
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

277
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:16,276
<font color="yellow">They say you must tell the truth
no matter what the situation is.</font>

278
00:18:16,306 --> 00:18:18,146
<font color="yellow">You can't blame anyone.</font>

279
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:22,446
<font color="yellow">You can't blame your daughter who
grew up well without a father,</font>

280
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:26,146
<font color="yellow">and you can't blame me who
told you not to date that man.</font>

281
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,676
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Mom.</font>

282
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,446
<font color="yellow">Do you have to be like this in front of me?</font>

283
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:33,576
<font color="yellow">You'll soon be in your 60s.</font>

284
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:37,946
<font color="yellow">Do you have make your aged
mother see you live like this?</font>

285
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,446
<font color="yellow">How can you do this?</font>

286
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:46,305
<font color="yellow">I haven't said anything so far
because I knew you'd be upset.</font>

287
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:48,146
<font color="yellow">Even when you and Jeong Eun were
having fights, I thought...</font>

288
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:52,576
<font color="yellow">you would know how I felt since
you had a daughter like yourself.</font>

289
00:18:52,616 --> 00:18:54,216
<font color="yellow">That's what I thought, but what is this?</font>

290
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,675
<font color="yellow">You locked the door for three days...</font>

291
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,206
<font color="yellow">and drank day and night?</font>

292
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,846
<font color="yellow">Is this how a person lives?</font>

293
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,375
<font color="yellow">Do you call yourself my daughter?</font>

294
00:19:01,376 --> 00:19:03,676
<font color="yellow">Then, what other choice do I have?</font>

295
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:08,246
<font color="yellow">This is so hard on me.
What am I supposed to do?</font>

296
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:12,275
<font color="yellow">I'm having a hard time because I
think my life has been a waste.</font>

297
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,275
<font color="yellow">I feel this is so unfair for me and
I am so furious. What can I do?</font>

298
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,905
<font color="yellow">Are you the only one who's
having a hard time?</font>

299
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,776
<font color="yellow">How about your daughter and me?
Don't you think it's easy for us?</font>

300
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:26,646
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to set her
up with that baritone singer?</font>

301
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,675
<font color="yellow">You should have learned your
lesson with baritone singers.</font>

302
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,275
<font color="yellow">Are you still clueless?</font>

303
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:33,146
<font color="yellow">Is that why you introduced
him to your own daughter?</font>

304
00:19:33,276 --> 00:19:36,505
<font color="yellow">As soon as I heard it,
I wanted to scold you.</font>

305
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:38,746
<font color="yellow">You are so shallow.</font>

306
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:41,046
<font color="yellow">- Mom.
- Shut it.</font>

307
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,146
<font color="yellow">Don't come on the day
of the Lunar New Year.</font>

308
00:19:43,346 --> 00:19:45,876
<font color="yellow">I don't want to see you drunk.</font>

309
00:19:45,946 --> 00:19:47,345
<font color="yellow">All you do is complain...</font>

310
00:19:47,346 --> 00:19:50,046
<font color="yellow">and pick a fight with the family.
I don't want to see any of it.</font>

311
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:52,675
<font color="yellow">Please just stay here and enjoy...</font>

312
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,716
<font color="yellow">your own company like the
artist you call yourself.</font>

313
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:12,846
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Dad?</font>

314
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:15,846
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I'm just
wondering when you will be home.</font>

315
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:17,946
<font color="yellow">Is there something wrong?</font>

316
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,845
<font color="yellow">My gosh. Your mother told
me to peel the chestnuts...</font>

317
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,616
<font color="yellow">since it's Lunar New Year's day tomorrow.</font>

318
00:20:23,006 --> 00:20:25,376
<font color="yellow">It's so hard to peel them.</font>

319
00:20:25,576 --> 00:20:27,116
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to help me with them.</font>

320
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:30,976
<font color="yellow">I will finish soon since the
holiday starts tomorrow.</font>

321
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,746
<font color="yellow">Leave them to me. I will
peel them when I get home.</font>

322
00:20:34,246 --> 00:20:36,946
<font color="yellow">I wouldn't say this to
you if it weren't hard.</font>

323
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,945
<font color="yellow">Since your brothers are not here
and I am the only one here,</font>

324
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,346
<font color="yellow">she's making me work.</font>

325
00:20:42,446 --> 00:20:44,476
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will be home soon.</font>

326
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:50,346
<font color="yellow">I always forget something
whenever I go grocery shopping.</font>

327
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:53,676
<font color="yellow">Can you peel these balloonflower roots?</font>

328
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,276
<font color="yellow">You should have bought peeled ones.</font>

329
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:02,376
<font color="yellow">They were sold out. I had no other options.</font>

330
00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:04,545
<font color="yellow">It's not easy for me.</font>

331
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,846
<font color="yellow">I am not even half way
done with the chestnuts.</font>

332
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:09,306
<font color="yellow">So will you peel them or not?</font>

333
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,946
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

334
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:16,246
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you this morning?</font>

335
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,276
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

336
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:26,576
<font color="yellow">When you are going home, take this home.</font>

337
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,676
<font color="yellow">This is a present from me
for the Lunar New Year.</font>

338
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,675
<font color="yellow">It's the traditional
fermented soybean paste.</font>

339
00:21:34,676 --> 00:21:36,476
<font color="yellow">- Isn't it?
- That's right.</font>

340
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,206
<font color="yellow">Did you end up bringing it?</font>

341
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:40,876
<font color="yellow">This is really authentic.</font>

342
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:43,346
<font color="yellow">It smells wonderful.</font>

343
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,615
<font color="yellow">It stinks. Close the lid.</font>

344
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:47,446
<font color="yellow">- My clothes will smell like it.
- My gosh.</font>

345
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,645
<font color="yellow">This is why I don't like
the younger generation.</font>

346
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:52,876
<font color="yellow">They don't know nothing
about their hometown.</font>

347
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,546
<font color="yellow">This is authentic indeed.</font>

348
00:21:54,676 --> 00:21:56,776
<font color="yellow">Did you Grandmother make it?</font>

349
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:59,276
<font color="yellow">- Of course, she did.
- Thank you, Dong Hui.</font>

350
00:21:59,546 --> 00:22:01,246
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I will enjoy it for sure.</font>

351
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,246
<font color="yellow">What is the smell?</font>

352
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:06,256
<font color="yellow">It's the fermented soybean
paste from Dong Hui.</font>

353
00:22:06,976 --> 00:22:08,746
<font color="yellow">Is it fermented soybean paste this time?</font>

354
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:11,206
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep doing this?</font>

355
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,806
<font color="yellow">I didn't mean any harm.</font>

356
00:22:14,506 --> 00:22:17,946
<font color="yellow">I guess your family will like
it since it's the holiday.</font>

357
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,776
<font color="yellow">Is there one for me?</font>

358
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,146
<font color="yellow">Why don't you finish up your work?</font>

359
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:24,776
<font color="yellow">Let's call it a day today.</font>

360
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,946
<font color="yellow">Please hurry if any of you
are going to your hometown.</font>

361
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,806
<font color="yellow">Those who aren't going should still
spend the time with your family.</font>

362
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,006
<font color="yellow">- How nice.
- Great.</font>

363
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:36,905
<font color="yellow">Please have nice holidays.</font>

364
00:22:36,906 --> 00:22:38,146
<font color="yellow">I hope for a safe return.</font>

365
00:22:38,246 --> 00:22:40,446
<font color="yellow">Everyone, Happy New Year.</font>

366
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:43,746
<font color="yellow">- Happy New Year to you, Director.
- Happy New Year to you, Director.</font>

367
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,776
<font color="yellow">Director, please have this.</font>

368
00:22:46,006 --> 00:22:48,606
<font color="yellow">Just like the previous time,
yours is slightly bigger.</font>

369
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:52,676
<font color="yellow">I guess now she has caught on how
to be sociable in the company.</font>

370
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:55,416
<font color="yellow">From now on, you don't need
to give me things like this.</font>

371
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:58,946
<font color="yellow">Director Han, can we go over some
documents before you go home?</font>

372
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,076
<font color="yellow">My goodness, Chang Soo!</font>

373
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:45,045
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo!</font>

374
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:47,046
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo!</font>

375
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:54,976
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

376
00:24:55,506 --> 00:24:57,546
<font color="yellow">Until when do we need to do this?</font>

377
00:24:57,576 --> 00:24:59,046
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

378
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:01,676
<font color="yellow">I have to practice until
I can do it perfectly.</font>

379
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:06,476
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

380
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,376
<font color="yellow">can't...</font>

381
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,976
<font color="yellow">understand you, kids.</font>

382
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:14,746
<font color="yellow">One of them wants to be a magician.</font>

383
00:25:15,276 --> 00:25:16,306
<font color="yellow">The other one...</font>

384
00:25:18,846 --> 00:25:20,476
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Hye Joo!</font>

385
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:23,676
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

386
00:25:27,046 --> 00:25:28,246
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

387
00:25:29,476 --> 00:25:32,206
<font color="yellow">What is going on here?</font>

388
00:25:34,846 --> 00:25:38,146
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Nothing.</font>

389
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:42,406
<font color="yellow">Mother, I will go to a stationary store.</font>

390
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,146
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. I'm coming with you.</font>

391
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,376
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

392
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,345
<font color="yellow">Okay. Don't trip on the way.</font>

393
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:51,376
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

394
00:25:58,806 --> 00:26:00,476
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Something has happened.</font>

395
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,876
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

396
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:04,106
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

397
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:06,106
<font color="yellow">Can you take a look at this?</font>

398
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:16,176
<font color="yellow">- Chang Soo, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?</font>

399
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:19,006
<font color="yellow">Hey. What are you doing?</font>

400
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:20,646
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

401
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,406
<font color="yellow">It's the thigh band. I'm just trying it on.</font>

402
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:25,676
<font color="yellow">- Why?
- Why?</font>

403
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:29,906
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, two? Why
are you repeating each other?</font>

404
00:26:30,576 --> 00:26:32,576
<font color="yellow">Well, there is...</font>

405
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:34,146
<font color="yellow">a reason to it.</font>

406
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,076
<font color="yellow">Yes, there's a reason to it.</font>

407
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:40,746
<font color="yellow">I want to try Korean wrestling. Can
I attend Kyung Woon Middle School?</font>

408
00:26:43,046 --> 00:26:44,046
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

409
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,326
<font color="yellow">I heard there's a Korean wrestling team.
I want to do my best there.</font>

410
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:50,376
<font color="yellow">I should be good at something. It's
how I will make you and Dad happy.</font>

411
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,206
<font color="yellow">Well, Chang Soo.</font>

412
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:56,246
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

413
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:59,906
<font color="yellow">There's something I want to ask you.</font>

414
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:04,176
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

415
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:08,776
<font color="yellow">How do you feel when you sing?</font>

416
00:27:09,246 --> 00:27:10,275
<font color="yellow">When I sing?</font>

417
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:12,146
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

418
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:16,446
<font color="yellow">you volunteered at the church
and the nursing home before.</font>

419
00:27:16,476 --> 00:27:18,506
<font color="yellow">That brings me to my question.</font>

420
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:22,676
<font color="yellow">I'm asking you how you feel when you sing.</font>

421
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,276
<font color="yellow">I'm also asking you the same question.</font>

422
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,106
<font color="yellow">When I sing?</font>

423
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:31,046
<font color="yellow">It's hard to explain.</font>

424
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,746
<font color="yellow">Well, it feels like...</font>

425
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:41,046
<font color="yellow">I feel like my body is
being sucked into space.</font>

426
00:27:42,906 --> 00:27:45,206
<font color="yellow">Did you say "space"?</font>

427
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:48,476
<font color="yellow">Yes, my body feels like it's
being sucked into space...</font>

428
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,506
<font color="yellow">and I float around in space.</font>

429
00:27:51,746 --> 00:27:54,346
<font color="yellow">All of a sudden, I feel like
space and I become one.</font>

430
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,306
<font color="yellow">Then, space and I disappear...</font>

431
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,846
<font color="yellow">and only the song remains.</font>

432
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:02,005
<font color="yellow">- Do you mean it?
- Yes, he means it, Hye Joo.</font>

433
00:28:02,006 --> 00:28:03,246
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

434
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:05,206
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

435
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:08,246
<font color="yellow">I can't see anything since
it's pitch-dark in space.</font>

436
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,206
<font color="yellow">From somewhere, I can hear a song.</font>

437
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:15,676
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

438
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,276
<font color="yellow">I don't think if the
voice is from angels...</font>

439
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:20,876
<font color="yellow">or from me.</font>

440
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:26,946
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

441
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:30,206
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I want to transfer
to Kyung Woon Middle School.</font>

442
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:31,506
<font color="yellow">I will do Korean wrestling.</font>

443
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:33,576
<font color="yellow">How do I look? Doesn't it suit me?</font>

444
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:38,376
<font color="yellow">It doesn't?</font>

445
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,406
<font color="yellow">What brings you here?</font>

446
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,946
<font color="yellow">I'm here to get that
fermented soybean paste.</font>

447
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:50,146
<font color="yellow">Why don't I get anything?</font>

448
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:52,876
<font color="yellow">You didn't give me omija
or rice cake last time,</font>

449
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:54,376
<font color="yellow">and you didn't give me
fermented soybean paste.</font>

450
00:28:54,406 --> 00:28:55,606
<font color="yellow">Why are you discriminating?</font>

451
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:59,076
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, aren't you supposed to...</font>

452
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:00,346
<font color="yellow">flatter your boss?</font>

453
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:05,676
<font color="yellow">You're flattering Director
Bang because she's above me.</font>

454
00:29:06,506 --> 00:29:08,676
<font color="yellow">Come with me. I'll get you some.</font>

455
00:29:11,306 --> 00:29:13,606
<font color="yellow">But first, show me your script.</font>

456
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:16,276
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

457
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:18,676
<font color="yellow">You talk as if I owe it to you.</font>

458
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,006
<font color="yellow">Yes, you owe it to me.</font>

459
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:23,576
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

460
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:27,976
<font color="yellow">I need to check first if
you've been working hard.</font>

461
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:31,676
<font color="yellow">I'll print it out. Please wait a little.</font>

462
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:33,476
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go ahead and print it.</font>

463
00:29:33,876 --> 00:29:36,076
<font color="yellow">- I'll make some ramyeon.
- Pardon?</font>

464
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:21,276
<font color="yellow">How can he touch her here?</font>

465
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,405
<font color="yellow">She has never even held
hands with a man before.</font>

466
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,276
<font color="yellow">Besides, she went to him to ask for help.</font>

467
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:30,476
<font color="yellow">How can he touch her immediately?</font>

468
00:30:30,606 --> 00:30:33,106
<font color="yellow">Don't be so violent, Miss Writer.</font>

469
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:37,346
<font color="yellow">He didn't touch her immediately.
Besides, he hardly touched her.</font>

470
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,746
<font color="yellow">He just grabbed her hand to take her.</font>

471
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,846
<font color="yellow">Nobody would think he was touching her.</font>

472
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:44,876
<font color="yellow">But he hugged her shoulders.</font>

473
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:48,506
<font color="yellow">You created that man, you know?</font>

474
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:51,575
<font color="yellow">You made him the womanizer.</font>

475
00:30:51,576 --> 00:30:53,506
<font color="yellow">Until when will you make him stay pure?</font>

476
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:56,606
<font color="yellow">Still, how can he hit on
his client like that?</font>

477
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:59,546
<font color="yellow">You read the synopsis. He's the man...</font>

478
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:03,246
<font color="yellow">who never hits on his client.</font>

479
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:07,276
<font color="yellow">Yeon Hee is very desperate.</font>

480
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:11,206
<font color="yellow">She mustered her courage and went
there to win Woo Hyeon's heart.</font>

481
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:16,076
<font color="yellow">When they met for the second time,
Jun Sung already started to...</font>

482
00:31:18,046 --> 00:31:19,546
<font color="yellow">have feelings for her.</font>

483
00:31:20,606 --> 00:31:22,176
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

484
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:24,546
<font color="yellow">No way? But it's true.</font>

485
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,746
<font color="yellow">You're too old-fashioned.</font>

486
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:32,946
<font color="yellow">If you make a drama like this,
it will have a bad rating.</font>

487
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,906
<font color="yellow">You are behind the times.</font>

488
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:39,805
<font color="yellow">Never mind. I won't show it to you anymore.</font>

489
00:31:39,806 --> 00:31:41,876
<font color="yellow">I'll just review it myself. Give it to me.</font>

490
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:46,006
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- Give it to me.</font>

491
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,575
<font color="yellow">If I keep taking your advice,</font>

492
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,476
<font color="yellow">the story will be spoiled.</font>

493
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:53,476
<font color="yellow">Give it to me. Give it to me.</font>

494
00:31:55,176 --> 00:31:57,776
<font color="yellow">Don't move. Stay still.</font>

495
00:32:01,676 --> 00:32:02,906
<font color="yellow">This is it.</font>

496
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:06,576
<font color="yellow">When a man and a woman meet,
they just need to go for it.</font>

497
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:09,176
<font color="yellow">Stop arguing logic and etiquette.</font>

498
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:17,076
<font color="yellow">You said you want to be a writer.</font>

499
00:32:17,946 --> 00:32:21,546
<font color="yellow">You have to come out of yourself
and get ahead of the viewers.</font>

500
00:32:23,476 --> 00:32:26,406
<font color="yellow">Like this, the viewers won't wait for you.</font>

501
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,806
<font color="yellow">This is my taking revenge on
you for dumping me to write.</font>

502
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:19,106
<font color="yellow">Preserve it with honey and
make juice every morning.</font>

503
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:20,206
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ma'am.</font>

504
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:24,146
<font color="yellow">Why would you bother yourself to
visit me every Lunar New Year?</font>

505
00:33:24,206 --> 00:33:25,976
<font color="yellow">You are an adult too.</font>

506
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:30,776
<font color="yellow">I may be old too, but I am
still like your little sister.</font>

507
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:37,806
<font color="yellow">This omija is nice. It's not too sour.</font>

508
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:40,946
<font color="yellow">It tastes just like omija I
used to have in your house.</font>

509
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:44,276
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

510
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:46,946
<font color="yellow">Do you remember the lady who
used to be your helper?</font>

511
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:51,076
<font color="yellow">When we were in high school,
we used to gather...</font>

512
00:33:51,146 --> 00:33:53,006
<font color="yellow">with Kwang Woo to study at your place.</font>

513
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:57,306
<font color="yellow">And that helper made the most
delicious snacks for us.</font>

514
00:33:58,846 --> 00:34:00,406
<font color="yellow">I still remember her.</font>

515
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,846
<font color="yellow">I think she cooked very well.</font>

516
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:06,376
<font color="yellow">- What about her?
- That lady...</font>

517
00:34:06,946 --> 00:34:09,646
<font color="yellow">was cleaning our building just recently.</font>

518
00:34:10,546 --> 00:34:12,516
<font color="yellow">I wasn't sure at first.</font>

519
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,146
<font color="yellow">But it was her. I'm sure it was her.</font>

520
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:19,776
<font color="yellow">Didn't she quit your house because
she had to take care of...</font>

521
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,376
<font color="yellow">her grandchildren after
the death of her son?</font>

522
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:26,516
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think that's what happened.</font>

523
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:29,946
<font color="yellow">It's been too long though.
What about that anyway?</font>

524
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:33,246
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. It's just that...</font>

525
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:34,906
<font color="yellow">your family started struggling...</font>

526
00:34:35,516 --> 00:34:37,676
<font color="yellow">after she left. That's what I thought.</font>

527
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,406
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

528
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:42,176
<font color="yellow">Think about it.</font>

529
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:45,076
<font color="yellow">Kwang Woo's family died of accident,</font>

530
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,016
<font color="yellow">and the chairman went missing.</font>

531
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:52,306
<font color="yellow">Until when do we have to wait for her?</font>

532
00:34:53,776 --> 00:34:56,276
<font color="yellow">Is she really still alive?</font>

533
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:59,646
<font color="yellow">What? Why would you bring that up?</font>

534
00:35:00,246 --> 00:35:02,546
<font color="yellow">We need to find out whether
she is still alive or not...</font>

535
00:35:02,676 --> 00:35:04,606
<font color="yellow">for you to become the largest shareholder.</font>

536
00:35:04,906 --> 00:35:07,246
<font color="yellow">This is why the stockholders...</font>

537
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,106
<font color="yellow">look down on you.</font>

538
00:35:13,106 --> 00:35:14,546
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

539
00:35:15,776 --> 00:35:18,246
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Mi Joo.
- Hello, Mi Joo.</font>

540
00:35:18,406 --> 00:35:20,276
<font color="yellow">You've gotten even more beautiful.</font>

541
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:22,746
<font color="yellow">You should get married soon.
Don't you agree?</font>

542
00:35:22,976 --> 00:35:25,076
<font color="yellow">She has to learn the work a little more.</font>

543
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:26,806
<font color="yellow">But she's a daughter.</font>

544
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:30,016
<font color="yellow">You should get a son-in-law
first and train them together.</font>

545
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:32,906
<font color="yellow">You're here, Mi Joo.</font>

546
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:35,106
<font color="yellow">Please take this.</font>

547
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:38,106
<font color="yellow">- What's this?
- One of my employees gave it to me.</font>

548
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:40,376
<font color="yellow">Open it in the kitchen. It will smell.</font>

549
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,846
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

550
00:35:42,046 --> 00:35:44,206
<font color="yellow">It must be homemade
fermented soybean paste.</font>

551
00:35:45,046 --> 00:35:47,176
<font color="yellow">That lady made...</font>

552
00:35:47,276 --> 00:35:49,176
<font color="yellow">the best fermented soybean paste.</font>

553
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,806
<font color="yellow">Which lady are you talking about?</font>

554
00:35:57,776 --> 00:36:01,246
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Take it easy. It
will get dusty in here.</font>

555
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:04,876
<font color="yellow">I want to get rid of the
disgusting dust from 2016.</font>

556
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:07,675
<font color="yellow">You must be happy that
you lived to greet 2017.</font>

557
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:09,576
<font color="yellow">Why would the dust be disgusting?</font>

558
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:12,975
<font color="yellow">You're such an understanding person.</font>

559
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:15,176
<font color="yellow">You're even wearing a cast today.</font>

560
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,106
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

561
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,846
<font color="yellow">I fell very lightly, but it hurt too much.</font>

562
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:23,806
<font color="yellow">So I went to see the doctor, and
it turns out my bone is cracked.</font>

563
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,545
<font color="yellow">That's why you should have
just hung out with me.</font>

564
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,176
<font color="yellow">Why do you do that cleaning job?</font>

565
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,606
<font color="yellow">I won't go anymore.</font>

566
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:36,645
<font color="yellow">My kids are making a big
fuss because of my arm.</font>

567
00:36:36,646 --> 00:36:38,546
<font color="yellow">They gave me a harder time.</font>

568
00:36:38,746 --> 00:36:40,206
<font color="yellow">Of course you shouldn't go.</font>

569
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,545
<font color="yellow">You still work at your age
and support your children.</font>

570
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:45,076
<font color="yellow">But that's all useless.</font>

571
00:36:47,076 --> 00:36:49,516
<font color="yellow">Stop being so mad at your daughter.</font>

572
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:51,146
<font color="yellow">But I can't help myself.</font>

573
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,906
<font color="yellow">I tried so hard to educate her.</font>

574
00:36:54,016 --> 00:36:56,946
<font color="yellow">Do you know how expensive it
was to get her piano lessons?</font>

575
00:36:57,306 --> 00:37:00,176
<font color="yellow">The lessons were so expensive
and I paid the tuition, too.</font>

576
00:37:00,346 --> 00:37:02,206
<font color="yellow">I worked so hard to make
her good at playing piano.</font>

577
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:05,746
<font color="yellow">But she fell in love with
that useless vocalist.</font>

578
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:09,076
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be telling you this,</font>

579
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:12,016
<font color="yellow">but she got pregnant and had
to give up her studies.</font>

580
00:37:12,276 --> 00:37:16,106
<font color="yellow">She's still depressed because
of that, and I'm always upset.</font>

581
00:37:16,206 --> 00:37:18,105
<font color="yellow">That's how she lives.</font>

582
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:20,145
<font color="yellow">When I went there the other day,</font>

583
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:22,776
<font color="yellow">she was playing the piano
loudly like a mad woman...</font>

584
00:37:22,876 --> 00:37:24,516
<font color="yellow">and drank unbelievably a lot.</font>

585
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,276
<font color="yellow">When I see her, I don't even
feel the joy of living.</font>

586
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:31,016
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

587
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,676
<font color="yellow">that's no reason to take out
all your clothes at this hour.</font>

588
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,606
<font color="yellow">It's just that I can't control my anger.</font>

589
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:41,106
<font color="yellow">I think I will feel calmer
only when I organize things.</font>

590
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:45,446
<font color="yellow">By the way, why do you keep this?</font>

591
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:51,546
<font color="yellow">People call you an oldie because
you keep things like this.</font>

592
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:56,076
<font color="yellow">Don't touch that. Why
do you touch my things?</font>

593
00:37:57,016 --> 00:37:58,306
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What's this?</font>

594
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:01,745
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Don't touch it.</font>

595
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:03,306
<font color="yellow">My goodness, look at this.</font>

596
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,076
<font color="yellow">Give it to me.</font>

597
00:38:05,646 --> 00:38:07,806
<font color="yellow">Isn't that the key to your safe?</font>

598
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:11,676
<font color="yellow">- Do you have hidden fund?
- No.</font>

599
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:15,576
<font color="yellow">Why do you have so many secrets?</font>

600
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,676
<font color="yellow">- I don't.
- Goodness.</font>

601
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:21,276
<font color="yellow">You are so secretive.</font>

602
00:38:53,406 --> 00:38:54,516
<font color="yellow">Hi, Reporter Yim.</font>

603
00:38:55,476 --> 00:38:57,196
<font color="yellow">I sent you the confidential report about...</font>

604
00:38:57,806 --> 00:39:01,446
<font color="yellow">the corrupt relationship of Seonghan
Group with Senior Secretary.</font>

605
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,676
<font color="yellow">Yes. I hope...</font>

606
00:39:06,476 --> 00:39:08,246
<font color="yellow">you will fulfill your duty...</font>

607
00:39:09,176 --> 00:39:10,376
<font color="yellow">as a reporter.</font>

608
00:39:12,746 --> 00:39:13,806
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good luck.</font>

609
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:27,476
<font color="yellow">I took care of the problem very
perfectly again this time, Sir.</font>

610
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,975
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you handled it well...</font>

611
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,346
<font color="yellow">since you took care of it yourself. Right?</font>

612
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:38,076
<font color="yellow">Thank you very much.</font>

613
00:39:38,446 --> 00:39:41,776
<font color="yellow">So, you said you wanted to
introduce someone to me.</font>

614
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:42,876
<font color="yellow">Do I have to wait?</font>

615
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:43,946
<font color="yellow">Oh, yes.</font>

616
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:47,446
<font color="yellow">She'll be here soon.</font>

617
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,545
<font color="yellow">Hello, Senior Secretary.</font>

618
00:39:56,546 --> 00:39:59,746
<font color="yellow">You're Jang Yoo Ra, the famous anchor.</font>

619
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,446
<font color="yellow">I see you recognize her.</font>

620
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:04,946
<font color="yellow">Thank you for recognizing me, Sir.</font>

621
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:06,176
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

622
00:40:11,946 --> 00:40:14,176
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Seong Sik who
appears on TV shows,</font>

623
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:16,846
<font color="yellow">I was able to meet a beautiful anchor.</font>

624
00:40:16,876 --> 00:40:18,106
<font color="yellow">This is great.</font>

625
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,076
<font color="yellow">I'm flattered.</font>

626
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:26,946
<font color="yellow">You don't have to worry about that.</font>

627
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:30,446
<font color="yellow">I will talk to President
Lee about it myself.</font>

628
00:40:32,676 --> 00:40:34,146
<font color="yellow">Would you really do that?</font>

629
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:40,976
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

630
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:43,406
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much, Sir.</font>

631
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:44,606
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

632
00:40:44,846 --> 00:40:47,845
<font color="yellow">You didn't need to get so serious
to ask me something like this.</font>

633
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,146
<font color="yellow">Aren't we too close for that?</font>

634
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:52,906
<font color="yellow">Are we?</font>

635
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:56,806
<font color="yellow">Anyway, take this.</font>

636
00:40:58,746 --> 00:40:59,806
<font color="yellow">What...</font>

637
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:01,516
<font color="yellow">is this?</font>

638
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:05,406
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

639
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:08,846
<font color="yellow">Seonghan Group could escape
the crisis, thanks to you.</font>

640
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:10,876
<font color="yellow">Their son could avoid the imprisonment too.</font>

641
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:13,946
<font color="yellow">This is a small present from the president.</font>

642
00:41:15,846 --> 00:41:16,976
<font color="yellow">I'm honored,</font>

643
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,476
<font color="yellow">but how can I accept this?</font>

644
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:23,376
<font color="yellow">Just take it. He's just
showing his gratitude.</font>

645
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:27,676
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

646
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:32,076
<font color="yellow">I can still smell the fried chicken here.</font>

647
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:35,196
<font color="yellow">I heard fried chicken restaurants
aren't doing well these days.</font>

648
00:41:35,476 --> 00:41:38,306
<font color="yellow">I guess that restaurant is an exception.</font>

649
00:41:38,446 --> 00:41:39,446
<font color="yellow">Yes, well...</font>

650
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:45,976
<font color="yellow">The owner isn't good at everything else,</font>

651
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:48,876
<font color="yellow">but he's famous for making
great fried chicken.</font>

652
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,476
<font color="yellow">I wonder whom Seong Sik is meeting with.</font>

653
00:41:56,606 --> 00:41:59,106
<font color="yellow">The preparation for the
by-election is going well, right?</font>

654
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,946
<font color="yellow">I'll expect to see you join our party soon.</font>

655
00:42:01,046 --> 00:42:03,076
<font color="yellow">Yes. I got it, Sir.</font>

656
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:11,245
<font color="yellow">Isn't that Senior Secretary?</font>

657
00:42:11,246 --> 00:42:12,676
<font color="yellow">No, you don't need to.</font>

658
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:15,576
<font color="yellow">Okay. Goodbye, Sir.</font>

659
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:21,176
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

660
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:25,776
<font color="yellow">What is that brat up to?</font>

661
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,306
<font color="yellow">Please get in.</font>

662
00:42:31,346 --> 00:42:32,346
<font color="yellow">Lucky me!</font>

663
00:42:41,946 --> 00:42:42,976
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik.</font>

664
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:49,346
<font color="yellow">Go away. My goodness.</font>

665
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:54,016
<font color="yellow">That brat...</font>

666
00:42:56,446 --> 00:42:58,476
<font color="yellow">That crazy punk.</font>

667
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:17,446
<font color="yellow">- What do you think?
- I like it.</font>

668
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:22,906
<font color="yellow">Do you like it?</font>

669
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:24,576
<font color="yellow">All right, then.</font>

670
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:29,576
<font color="yellow">Yoo Ra.</font>

671
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:31,846
<font color="yellow">Shall we go in?</font>

672
00:43:32,946 --> 00:43:34,076
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

673
00:43:45,676 --> 00:43:48,906
<font color="yellow">- Grandma, Dad, Mom, Ms. Oh.
- Grandma, Dad, Mom, Ms. Oh.</font>

674
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:51,976
<font color="yellow">- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.</font>

675
00:43:53,476 --> 00:43:57,406
<font color="yellow">My gosh. All right. How nice!</font>

676
00:43:58,306 --> 00:43:59,845
<font color="yellow">Aren't you happy, Ms. Oh?</font>

677
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,876
<font color="yellow">Yes. Of course.</font>

678
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:04,775
<font color="yellow">Grandma. I hope your arm
will get better soon.</font>

679
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:08,805
<font color="yellow">All right. Thank you, my dear Ah in.</font>

680
00:44:08,806 --> 00:44:10,446
<font color="yellow">- Grandma!
- Yes.</font>

681
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,446
<font color="yellow">- All right.
- Her arm hurts. Let me hug you.</font>

682
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:17,346
<font color="yellow">All right. I wish...</font>

683
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:20,346
<font color="yellow">all of you great happiness...</font>

684
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:22,746
<font color="yellow">and great fortune this year.</font>

685
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:25,506
<font color="yellow">You two should stop having fights.</font>

686
00:44:26,546 --> 00:44:27,906
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Mom.</font>

687
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:29,375
<font color="yellow">I never do anything wrong.</font>

688
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:31,946
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon always picks
on me for no reason.</font>

689
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:36,406
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. You should try to be
a better son to us this year.</font>

690
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:39,606
<font color="yellow">Mom. Please don't worry.</font>

691
00:44:39,806 --> 00:44:43,306
<font color="yellow">I will be the one to take
care of our family...</font>

692
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,205
<font color="yellow">this year.</font>

693
00:44:45,206 --> 00:44:48,046
<font color="yellow">My gosh. He's all talk and no action.</font>

694
00:44:48,076 --> 00:44:49,746
<font color="yellow">I'm serious, Grandma.</font>

695
00:44:50,446 --> 00:44:53,176
<font color="yellow">You two should try to get along.</font>

696
00:44:53,606 --> 00:44:55,245
<font color="yellow">- Gosh, Mother.
- Mother.</font>

697
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:57,776
<font color="yellow">- We're on great terms now.
- We're good now.</font>

698
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:00,676
<font color="yellow">- Isn't that right, Hee Sook?
- Of course, Hye Joo.</font>

699
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:04,306
<font color="yellow">- By the way, Mom.
- Yes?</font>

700
00:45:04,446 --> 00:45:05,906
<font color="yellow">I don't see Ae Ri.</font>

701
00:45:07,046 --> 00:45:08,606
<font color="yellow">I told her not to come.</font>

702
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:11,275
<font color="yellow">- Why not?
- She's not allowed in this house.</font>

703
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14,175
<font color="yellow">From now on, those who is
self-indulgent on the excuse of...</font>

704
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:16,306
<font color="yellow">being an artist can't enter this house.</font>

705
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:17,606
<font color="yellow">If any of you...</font>

706
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:19,745
<font color="yellow">bring the food that...</font>

707
00:45:19,746 --> 00:45:23,246
<font color="yellow">we prepared for the
holidays to Ae Ri today,</font>

708
00:45:23,606 --> 00:45:26,376
<font color="yellow">you will pay for it. I will
give you a good scolding.</font>

709
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:29,005
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hwang. Please stop.</font>

710
00:45:29,006 --> 00:45:31,306
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be like that
on a happy day like this.</font>

711
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:34,676
<font color="yellow">By the way, where is Dong Hui?</font>

712
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:36,875
<font color="yellow">Isn't Dong Hui here yet?</font>

713
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:39,006
<font color="yellow">There're so many people
here, so I didn't notice.</font>

714
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:42,246
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon isn't here, either. Seong Joon.</font>

715
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,045
<font color="yellow">You should do a head count.</font>

716
00:45:44,046 --> 00:45:46,576
<font color="yellow">- Why can't you get everyone here?
- All right.</font>

717
00:45:48,676 --> 00:45:49,876
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

718
00:45:53,606 --> 00:45:56,506
<font color="yellow">You look so pretty, Dong Hui.</font>

719
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:58,546
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

720
00:46:01,246 --> 00:46:03,376
<font color="yellow">Come on. Do the New Year's bow.</font>

721
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:08,076
<font color="yellow">Mom. I can't button the shirt.</font>

722
00:46:11,446 --> 00:46:12,746
<font color="yellow">- It's done.
- Okay.</font>

723
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:15,246
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. You look like a new groom.</font>

724
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,576
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. Give them a bow.</font>

725
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:20,805
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Dong Hui, do it with Seong Joon.</font>

726
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:23,306
<font color="yellow">- All right. Do it together.
- Come to this side.</font>

727
00:46:28,576 --> 00:46:32,206
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Ms. Oh, Dad, and Mom.</font>

728
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:33,946
<font color="yellow">Happy New Year.</font>

729
00:46:34,176 --> 00:46:35,676
<font color="yellow">Happy New Year.</font>

730
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:44,406
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

731
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:46,146
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

732
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:49,346
<font color="yellow">Both of you look so good.</font>

733
00:46:49,746 --> 00:46:51,605
<font color="yellow">You look like the bride and groom.</font>

734
00:46:51,606 --> 00:46:53,346
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

735
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:56,876
<font color="yellow">My gosh. She looks beautiful.</font>

736
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:01,605
<font color="yellow">Magpie's new year's day was</font>

737
00:47:01,606 --> 00:47:05,006
<font color="yellow">Yesterday</font>

738
00:47:05,106 --> 00:47:08,446
<font color="yellow">Our new year's day is</font>

739
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:11,846
<font color="yellow">Today</font>

740
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:15,476
<font color="yellow">Pretty pigtail ribbon</font>

741
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:18,846
<font color="yellow">I put it on myself</font>

742
00:47:18,976 --> 00:47:22,506
<font color="yellow">A new pair of shoes</font>

743
00:47:22,576 --> 00:47:26,876
<font color="yellow">I put it on myself as well</font>

744
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:38,746
<font color="yellow">Pack some Korean pancake and fruits.</font>

745
00:47:39,146 --> 00:47:41,506
<font color="yellow">I've already packed fruits. I'm
packing Korean pancake now.</font>

746
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:44,605
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to give us any food?</font>

747
00:47:44,606 --> 00:47:46,546
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm coming.</font>

748
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:50,776
<font color="yellow">Wherever you are, I will be there</font>

749
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:53,246
<font color="yellow">What are you and Hee Sook talking about?</font>

750
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,846
<font color="yellow">You two are not that close.</font>

751
00:47:56,246 --> 00:47:58,906
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about, Seong Hoon?</font>

752
00:47:59,306 --> 00:48:01,776
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo and I are very close now.</font>

753
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,746
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't mind them. It won't last long.</font>

754
00:48:05,046 --> 00:48:07,606
<font color="yellow">Here. Let me pour you a drink.</font>

755
00:48:10,246 --> 00:48:12,376
<font color="yellow">Drink up.</font>

756
00:48:13,576 --> 00:48:15,546
<font color="yellow">Where are you</font>

757
00:48:15,676 --> 00:48:20,846
<font color="yellow">My dear</font>

758
00:48:22,576 --> 00:48:25,576
<font color="yellow">His voice sounds so powerful.</font>

759
00:48:25,676 --> 00:48:28,575
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Chang Soo is quite a singer.</font>

760
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,576
<font color="yellow">Of course. He's my grandson.</font>

761
00:48:38,746 --> 00:48:39,806
<font color="yellow">That was so hard.</font>

762
00:48:40,206 --> 00:48:43,606
<font color="yellow">Hey. How could we have
forgotten about Aunt?</font>

763
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:45,906
<font color="yellow">I know, right?</font>

764
00:48:46,046 --> 00:48:49,106
<font color="yellow">Sometimes, you don't see what
is right in front of you.</font>

765
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:50,206
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, let's get going.</font>

766
00:48:51,576 --> 00:48:52,676
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

767
00:48:53,176 --> 00:48:55,676
<font color="yellow">what's wrong with you?
Your hanbok is so gaudy.</font>

768
00:48:56,676 --> 00:49:00,146
<font color="yellow">Hey, you should be grateful that
I'm wearing hanbok at least.</font>

769
00:49:00,306 --> 00:49:03,376
<font color="yellow">I'm too fat to wear the one I
bought when I got married.</font>

770
00:49:03,506 --> 00:49:05,876
<font color="yellow">So I borrowed it at 80 dollars yesterday.</font>

771
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:08,406
<font color="yellow">I was a little, and this was the last one.</font>

772
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:11,276
<font color="yellow">Still, your hanbok is too garish.</font>

773
00:49:11,376 --> 00:49:13,376
<font color="yellow">What do you mean it's garish?</font>

774
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:17,206
<font color="yellow">Your former son might
major in classical music.</font>

775
00:49:17,346 --> 00:49:19,176
<font color="yellow">Please maintain your dignity.</font>

776
00:49:22,846 --> 00:49:24,506
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait for me.</font>

777
00:49:27,246 --> 00:49:28,746
<font color="yellow">I said wait for me.</font>

778
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:39,376
<font color="yellow">The one who visits your office often
recently by the black sedan...</font>

779
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:41,906
<font color="yellow">is Senior Secretary Kim, right?</font>

780
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:44,176
<font color="yellow">Didn't you see the flower pot he sent?</font>

781
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:47,276
<font color="yellow">We graduated the same college.</font>

782
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:50,506
<font color="yellow">Hey, are you close to everyone
who went to the same college?</font>

783
00:49:51,576 --> 00:49:53,676
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't be close to anyone like that.</font>

784
00:49:54,506 --> 00:49:55,646
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

785
00:49:55,906 --> 00:49:58,346
<font color="yellow">Now are you trying to pick
on the connections I have?</font>

786
00:49:58,546 --> 00:50:00,676
<font color="yellow">- That's not what I'm saying.
- My gosh.</font>

787
00:50:01,606 --> 00:50:04,746
<font color="yellow">Why do you hit me on New Year's Day?</font>

788
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:07,746
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're still a journalist?</font>

789
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:12,046
<font color="yellow">You're the owner of a chicken restaurant!</font>

790
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:13,646
<font color="yellow">How dare you!</font>

791
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:17,176
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter what my current job is.</font>

792
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:20,446
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you this because
I'm worried about you.</font>

793
00:50:20,506 --> 00:50:23,246
<font color="yellow">Then, tell me what makes you that worried!</font>

794
00:50:23,346 --> 00:50:25,576
<font color="yellow">Are you worried that I might
become too successful?</font>

795
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:29,776
<font color="yellow">It's silent now, but Kim Young
Tae and Seonghan Group...</font>

796
00:50:31,646 --> 00:50:33,746
<font color="yellow">They are involved in many problems.</font>

797
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:37,376
<font color="yellow">A naive guy like you is likely
to be framed up in the end.</font>

798
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:40,776
<font color="yellow">Your breath smells of liquor.
Are you drunk? Stop it.</font>

799
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:43,276
<font color="yellow">How can you be so ignorant?</font>

800
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:47,276
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, you drank too much.
Please stop drinking.</font>

801
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,327
<font color="yellow">If you become blinded by money,
power, and fame like now,</font>

802
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:54,746
<font color="yellow">you'll end up in a terrible fix.</font>

803
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:57,345
<font color="yellow">You'd better mark my words.</font>

804
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,376
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so fed up with you.</font>

805
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,746
<font color="yellow">Don't try to pick a fight because
you don't want me to succeed.</font>

806
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:06,046
<font color="yellow">Hey, what are you guys doing
in the beginning of the year?</font>

807
00:51:06,676 --> 00:51:09,446
<font color="yellow">Didn't you say you'd stop fighting?
What on earth is this?</font>

808
00:51:09,506 --> 00:51:11,646
<font color="yellow">- Answer me.
- Mom, Seong Hoon...</font>

809
00:51:11,806 --> 00:51:13,506
<font color="yellow">hit me like this again.</font>

810
00:51:13,906 --> 00:51:16,976
<font color="yellow">- You little jerk...
- Seong Hoon, let's go downstairs.</font>

811
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:19,606
<font color="yellow">- Go downstairs right now!
- Mom,</font>

812
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:22,346
<font color="yellow">- he just hit me.
- Leave already.</font>

813
00:51:27,846 --> 00:51:30,576
<font color="yellow">Thank you for washing dishes.
You can leave, too.</font>

814
00:51:31,446 --> 00:51:33,246
<font color="yellow">- Okay.
- Get out.</font>

815
00:51:39,606 --> 00:51:41,345
<font color="yellow">By the way, where are Hye Joo and Hee Sook?</font>

816
00:51:41,346 --> 00:51:43,846
<font color="yellow">Why did they leave the silly ones alone?</font>

817
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,975
<font color="yellow">There's a way to eat holiday
dishes even if she forbade me...</font>

818
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:52,676
<font color="yellow">from vising her house.</font>

819
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:57,376
<font color="yellow">How is it, Aunt? Is it good?</font>

820
00:51:57,676 --> 00:51:59,876
<font color="yellow">It's a little salty.</font>

821
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:03,075
<font color="yellow">Well, we're so sorry.
We should have been...</font>

822
00:52:03,076 --> 00:52:04,976
<font color="yellow">more careful.</font>

823
00:52:05,476 --> 00:52:07,576
<font color="yellow">By the way, did you say...</font>

824
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,376
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo will major in classical music?</font>

825
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,176
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

826
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:12,906
<font color="yellow">- Are you serious?
- I am.</font>

827
00:52:17,306 --> 00:52:18,846
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

828
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:20,806
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

829
00:52:26,846 --> 00:52:27,906
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

830
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,646
<font color="yellow">Aunt, please stop laughing.</font>

831
00:52:32,176 --> 00:52:34,446
<font color="yellow">We're really serious.</font>

832
00:52:34,806 --> 00:52:35,946
<font color="yellow">My dear.</font>

833
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:38,876
<font color="yellow">So every man for his own trade...</font>

834
00:52:39,646 --> 00:52:40,875
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

835
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:43,576
<font color="yellow">Aunt, he really has a talent.</font>

836
00:52:45,146 --> 00:52:47,576
<font color="yellow">- Gosh.
- She's right.</font>

837
00:52:47,676 --> 00:52:50,175
<font color="yellow">His talent as an opera singer is...</font>

838
00:52:50,176 --> 00:52:52,876
<font color="yellow">within top 0.001 percent of all.</font>

839
00:52:52,946 --> 00:52:55,406
<font color="yellow">Within top 0.001 percent of all.</font>

840
00:52:57,076 --> 00:53:00,945
<font color="yellow">Come to think of it, Chang Soo
has an extraordinary voice...</font>

841
00:53:00,946 --> 00:53:02,546
<font color="yellow">and a firm body.</font>

842
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:06,746
<font color="yellow">I think he should be a tenor...</font>

843
00:53:07,676 --> 00:53:09,646
<font color="yellow">- with his voice.
- Tenor...</font>

844
00:53:10,276 --> 00:53:11,646
<font color="yellow">- Tenor?
- Yes.</font>

845
00:53:12,146 --> 00:53:15,045
<font color="yellow">Males' voice types can be broken down...</font>

846
00:53:15,046 --> 00:53:17,676
<font color="yellow">into a tenor, baritone, and bass.</font>

847
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:20,946
<font color="yellow">To be more specific, the
types can be classified...</font>

848
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:22,776
<font color="yellow">as a sopranist,</font>

849
00:53:23,676 --> 00:53:26,106
<font color="yellow">countertenor, alto,</font>

850
00:53:26,606 --> 00:53:29,176
<font color="yellow">tenor, tenor-baritone,</font>

851
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:31,406
<font color="yellow">baritone, baritone-bass,</font>

852
00:53:31,506 --> 00:53:33,306
<font color="yellow">and bass.</font>

853
00:53:34,906 --> 00:53:36,976
<font color="yellow">Considering his voice,</font>

854
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:39,476
<font color="yellow">I think he should be a tenor.</font>

855
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:45,476
<font color="yellow">However, the tenor voice
type is divided into many.</font>

856
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:47,506
<font color="yellow">Lyric tenor.</font>

857
00:53:48,406 --> 00:53:50,906
<font color="yellow">It is a graceful voice.</font>

858
00:53:51,046 --> 00:53:53,675
<font color="yellow">It's the best voice for
young innocent guys...</font>

859
00:53:53,676 --> 00:53:56,146
<font color="yellow">who fell in love.</font>

860
00:53:56,576 --> 00:53:57,876
<font color="yellow">The next is spinto tenor.</font>

861
00:53:58,146 --> 00:53:59,946
<font color="yellow">The spinto tenor has...</font>

862
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:02,206
<font color="yellow">a young and bright voice
with a heavier vocal weight.</font>

863
00:54:03,776 --> 00:54:04,776
<font color="yellow">It's a perfect voice...</font>

864
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:08,376
<font color="yellow">for Commender Radames from "Aida" of Verdi.</font>

865
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:10,676
<font color="yellow">Dramatic tenor.</font>

866
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,676
<font color="yellow">This is my favorite.</font>

867
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:15,245
<font color="yellow">The dramatic tenor has an emotive...</font>

868
00:54:15,246 --> 00:54:17,876
<font color="yellow">and powerful tenor sound.</font>

869
00:54:18,246 --> 00:54:20,046
<font color="yellow">It's a ringing and heroic voice.</font>

870
00:54:20,406 --> 00:54:23,676
<font color="yellow">So what Chang Soo should do from now on?</font>

871
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:29,775
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

872
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:31,776
<font color="yellow">He needs to receive lessons
from Professor Park.</font>

873
00:54:32,776 --> 00:54:34,906
<font color="yellow">Professor... Professor Park?</font>

874
00:54:35,246 --> 00:54:38,746
<font color="yellow">Yes. He's a great singer.</font>

875
00:54:41,846 --> 00:54:43,846
<font color="yellow">I'll make an appointment for you.</font>

876
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,746
<font color="yellow">Visit him with Chang Soo.</font>

877
00:54:46,446 --> 00:54:48,476
<font color="yellow">Really? My goodness.</font>

878
00:54:50,276 --> 00:54:51,346
<font color="yellow">This is so great.</font>

879
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,176
<font color="yellow">Why the police? Why haven't
they contacted us yet?</font>

880
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:22,606
<font color="yellow">It's been 23 years. Please wait.</font>

881
00:55:24,776 --> 00:55:28,346
<font color="yellow">- Still, if they kept the records...
- Sir,</font>

882
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:31,346
<font color="yellow">It's even longer than two decades.</font>

883
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:34,676
<font color="yellow">I have a few things to
report while you're waiting.</font>

884
00:55:36,076 --> 00:55:37,776
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon handed over information...</font>

885
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:41,006
<font color="yellow">about the secret funds of
Hanseong to Jinsung Daily News.</font>

886
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:42,876
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik sent back...</font>

887
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:46,376
<font color="yellow">the car you lent him
only after three months.</font>

888
00:55:48,306 --> 00:55:50,846
<font color="yellow">Seonghan Group gave him
a luxurious sedan...</font>

889
00:55:51,346 --> 00:55:53,676
<font color="yellow">to muzzle him.</font>

890
00:55:56,906 --> 00:55:58,746
<font color="yellow">I guess Seonghan isn't fair game, either.</font>

891
00:56:00,246 --> 00:56:03,876
<font color="yellow">I think they plan to
completely destroy his life.</font>

892
00:56:04,046 --> 00:56:08,006
<font color="yellow">I think so, too. So we're not hundred
percent sure about Sang Woo.</font>

893
00:56:08,176 --> 00:56:10,676
<font color="yellow">So I'd like to ask you suspend your plan...</font>

894
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:13,306
<font color="yellow">regarding the Han brothers for a while.</font>

895
00:56:17,676 --> 00:56:21,646
<font color="yellow">Yet, they're the family
who has raised Sang Woo.</font>

896
00:56:25,776 --> 00:56:26,876
<font color="yellow">Where are you going?</font>

897
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:30,306
<font color="yellow">- To give New Year's greeting.
- Sorry?</font>

898
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:34,176
<font color="yellow">They've taken care of Sang Woo.</font>

899
00:56:34,746 --> 00:56:36,606
<font color="yellow">Then, I should go make a bow to them.</font>

900
00:56:39,806 --> 00:56:42,006
<font color="yellow">Who would it be? Who is it?</font>

901
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:50,146
<font color="yellow">- Hello.
- Goodness.</font>

902
00:56:50,176 --> 00:56:51,876
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Mr. Lee.
- Yes.</font>

903
00:56:52,146 --> 00:56:54,306
<font color="yellow">- Please take this.
- You didn't have to bring a gift.</font>

904
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:57,046
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Mr. Lee.
- Hello.</font>

905
00:56:58,146 --> 00:57:00,846
<font color="yellow">- I'm here for New Year's greeting.
- Welcome.</font>

906
00:57:05,176 --> 00:57:06,246
<font color="yellow">Let me make a bow, Sir.</font>

907
00:57:07,606 --> 00:57:09,876
<font color="yellow">There's no need to do it.</font>

908
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:17,146
<font color="yellow">Still, you're an elder
of this neighborhood.</font>

909
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:20,546
<font color="yellow">I wish your family peace and happiness.</font>

910
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:23,506
<font color="yellow">I hope so, too. But things
don't always go as we want.</font>

911
00:57:25,546 --> 00:57:29,006
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee, please have this.</font>

912
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:31,746
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to do this for me.</font>

913
00:57:32,676 --> 00:57:35,156
<font color="yellow">Please don't say that. I can't
let my guest leave empty-handed.</font>

914
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:36,546
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy.</font>

915
00:57:36,676 --> 00:57:38,976
<font color="yellow">- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.</font>

916
00:57:41,046 --> 00:57:42,876
<font color="yellow">- Please take your time.
- Okay.</font>

917
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:45,406
<font color="yellow">We were in the middle of playing go,</font>

918
00:57:45,576 --> 00:57:47,846
<font color="yellow">so we'll continue this round.</font>

919
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:52,006
<font color="yellow">We put money on this.</font>

920
00:57:52,776 --> 00:57:53,946
<font color="yellow">Sure. Please go on.</font>

921
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:02,606
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? It's your turn.</font>

922
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,646
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

923
00:58:11,606 --> 00:58:14,976
<font color="yellow">Wait, why did you put your stone there?</font>

924
00:58:15,376 --> 00:58:18,276
<font color="yellow">Dad, I did to win.</font>

925
00:58:18,776 --> 00:58:20,806
<font color="yellow">No way. Please undo it just once.</font>

926
00:58:21,976 --> 00:58:24,076
<font color="yellow">Dad, that's not fair.</font>

927
00:58:24,376 --> 00:58:26,976
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, come on.</font>

928
00:58:27,506 --> 00:58:29,246
<font color="yellow">Just once.</font>

929
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:32,476
<font color="yellow">I can't lose like this.</font>

930
00:58:32,746 --> 00:58:35,246
<font color="yellow">I was going to put mine there.</font>

931
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:37,746
<font color="yellow">No, I can't undo it.</font>

932
00:58:38,106 --> 00:58:41,946
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's me who raised
you into a smart guy.</font>

933
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,776
<font color="yellow">Dad, please stop it.</font>

934
00:58:46,476 --> 00:58:48,746
<font color="yellow">Just surrender and give me 10 dollars.</font>

935
00:58:48,806 --> 00:58:50,676
<font color="yellow">Just give me 10 dollars.</font>

936
00:58:50,746 --> 00:58:52,905
<font color="yellow">Please just let me take back a move.</font>

937
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:54,846
<font color="yellow">No. I can't let you do that.</font>

938
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:33,846
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

939
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:37,506
<font color="yellow">You should be wearing it.
It looked good on you.</font>

940
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:40,146
<font color="yellow">It's a bit uncomfortable.</font>

941
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:44,806
<font color="yellow">You should rest today. Why did you come up?</font>

942
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:47,506
<font color="yellow">If we rest just because it's the
holidays, when will you be a writer?</font>

943
00:59:47,646 --> 00:59:48,676
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

944
00:59:48,976 --> 00:59:50,106
<font color="yellow">You have to be a writer...</font>

945
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:54,206
<font color="yellow">so that you can put an end
to your love in your drama.</font>

946
00:59:55,306 --> 00:59:57,306
<font color="yellow">That's how your love in reality can start.</font>

947
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:13,476
<font color="yellow">Please excuse me.</font>

948
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:16,206
<font color="yellow">I'm here to see Director Han Seong Joon.</font>

949
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:18,506
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry to barge in on a holiday.</font>

950
01:00:19,076 --> 01:00:22,906
<font color="yellow">I think Seong Joon is on the rooftop.</font>

951
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:25,046
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

952
01:00:25,276 --> 01:00:28,546
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I will introduce myself later.</font>

953
01:00:34,406 --> 01:00:35,476
<font color="yellow">Who was it?</font>

954
01:00:35,676 --> 01:00:38,776
<font color="yellow">It was a lady. She hurried
inside and asked for Seong Joon.</font>

955
01:00:40,646 --> 01:00:41,706
<font color="yellow">A lady?</font>

956
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:43,246
<font color="yellow">Do you want some coffee?</font>

957
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,846
<font color="yellow">Are you running away again?</font>

958
01:00:48,576 --> 01:00:50,106
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me?
- I don't need...</font>

959
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:51,606
<font color="yellow">coffee.</font>

960
01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:53,976
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about your script.</font>

961
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:07,406
<font color="yellow">You haven't forgotten...</font>

962
01:01:07,946 --> 01:01:09,106
<font color="yellow">your proposal to me, right?</font>

963
01:01:09,376 --> 01:01:12,276
<font color="yellow">What proposal? I made a proposal? When?</font>

964
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:14,676
<font color="yellow">You promised you'll be...</font>

965
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:17,306
<font color="yellow">the most famous scriptwriter
in Korea in 10 years.</font>

966
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,146
<font color="yellow">When you do become one,
you made a proposal...</font>

967
01:01:20,446 --> 01:01:22,746
<font color="yellow">that I should produce your drama.</font>

968
01:01:26,906 --> 01:01:28,246
<font color="yellow">What were you thinking?</font>

969
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:32,546
<font color="yellow">Okay. I got it. So let's work hard.</font>

970
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:38,906
<font color="yellow">I think we stopped here.
Let's start revising.</font>

971
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,146
<font color="yellow">Your mother didn't come today.</font>

972
01:01:59,676 --> 01:02:02,476
<font color="yellow">Yes, she didn't. She had a big
argument with Grandmother.</font>

973
01:02:06,146 --> 01:02:07,346
<font color="yellow">Are you angry at me?</font>

974
01:02:07,776 --> 01:02:09,746
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am angry a bit.</font>

975
01:02:12,576 --> 01:02:15,776
<font color="yellow">You left just like that and
didn't leave me a message.</font>

976
01:02:18,646 --> 01:02:19,676
<font color="yellow">It's because...</font>

977
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,106
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

978
01:02:21,576 --> 01:02:24,206
<font color="yellow">Something urgent and hard
must have happened to you.</font>

979
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:26,676
<font color="yellow">I just...</font>

980
01:02:27,606 --> 01:02:29,106
<font color="yellow">waited for you for some time.</font>

981
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,776
<font color="yellow">I got tired of it and
that's why I am angry.</font>

982
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:41,646
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

983
01:02:42,876 --> 01:02:44,476
<font color="yellow">I didn't take...</font>

984
01:02:45,546 --> 01:02:47,076
<font color="yellow">a good care of you lately.</font>

985
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:50,876
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

986
01:02:52,276 --> 01:02:53,446
<font color="yellow">That's okay.</font>

987
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:57,476
<font color="yellow">I'd feel weird if someone was
trying to take care of me.</font>

988
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,376
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Eun.
- Let go of me.</font>

989
01:03:02,246 --> 01:03:03,306
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into you?</font>

990
01:03:03,476 --> 01:03:04,546
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

991
01:03:05,106 --> 01:03:06,806
<font color="yellow">are certainly a bad man.</font>

992
01:03:07,676 --> 01:03:08,976
<font color="yellow">By the way, Hyun Woo.</font>

993
01:03:11,346 --> 01:03:12,476
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

994
01:03:12,906 --> 01:03:14,446
<font color="yellow">What sort of person are you?</font>

995
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:18,176
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

996
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:21,846
<font color="yellow">I don't know anything about you.</font>

997
01:03:22,706 --> 01:03:26,446
<font color="yellow">I thought at least I would
know the most about you.</font>

998
01:03:27,146 --> 01:03:28,576
<font color="yellow">That was my mistake.</font>

999
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:31,876
<font color="yellow">- Jeong Eun.
- Aren't we...</font>

1000
01:03:33,006 --> 01:03:34,146
<font color="yellow">lovers?</font>

1001
01:03:34,846 --> 01:03:36,376
<font color="yellow">Aren't we dating?</font>

1002
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:40,176
<font color="yellow">Our history goes back to three
years ago when we met in New York,</font>

1003
01:03:40,646 --> 01:03:43,206
<font color="yellow">but why do you hide so many things from me?</font>

1004
01:03:43,546 --> 01:03:46,206
<font color="yellow">Why don't your actions add up?</font>

1005
01:03:48,506 --> 01:03:49,906
<font color="yellow">You're so brutal.</font>

1006
01:04:29,276 --> 01:04:30,476
<font color="yellow">Do you want to...</font>

1007
01:04:31,846 --> 01:04:33,006
<font color="yellow">know more about me?</font>

1008
01:04:49,446 --> 01:04:51,146
<font color="yellow">After my father passed away,</font>

1009
01:04:52,006 --> 01:04:54,406
<font color="yellow">my brother and I were sent to an orphanage.</font>

1010
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:59,206
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo was seven years old.</font>

1011
01:04:59,906 --> 01:05:01,506
<font color="yellow">After I went to school,</font>

1012
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:04,946
<font color="yellow">he always waited for me in
the yard of the orphanage.</font>

1013
01:05:07,176 --> 01:05:09,076
<font color="yellow">On that day, I ended later than usual.</font>

1014
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:12,506
<font color="yellow">I couldn't bring the school
supplies I was supposed to bring.</font>

1015
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,306
<font color="yellow">So I had to stay late to clean by myself.</font>

1016
01:05:18,746 --> 01:05:21,406
<font color="yellow">My brother who waited for
me, left the orphanage...</font>

1017
01:05:22,976 --> 01:05:24,646
<font color="yellow">since I didn't come.</font>

1018
01:05:27,406 --> 01:05:28,706
<font color="yellow">He wanted to look for me.</font>

1019
01:05:31,576 --> 01:05:33,406
<font color="yellow">He only had a light jacket.</font>

1020
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:38,246
<font color="yellow">After that day, I couldn't find my brother.</font>

1021
01:05:39,746 --> 01:05:41,006
<font color="yellow">After some time,</font>

1022
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:43,506
<font color="yellow">I was adopted by an American couple.</font>

1023
01:05:48,846 --> 01:05:50,146
<font color="yellow">I am an adoptee.</font>

1024
01:05:51,606 --> 01:05:53,076
<font color="yellow">An adoptee from an orphanage.</font>

1025
01:05:56,846 --> 01:05:59,006
<font color="yellow">And a brother who's looking
for his younger brother...</font>

1026
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:00,906
<font color="yellow">whom he lost 20 years ago.</font>

1027
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:04,706
<font color="yellow">That's who I am.</font>

1028
01:06:07,206 --> 01:06:08,446
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo.</font>

1029
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:14,206
<font color="yellow">After 20 years have passed,</font>

1030
01:06:15,646 --> 01:06:16,706
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

1031
01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:19,746
<font color="yellow">I can find my brother now.</font>

1032
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:21,446
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

1033
01:06:24,576 --> 01:06:25,646
<font color="yellow">I think...</font>

1034
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:27,846
<font color="yellow">I can find my bother now.</font>

1035
01:06:48,246 --> 01:06:49,776
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1036
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:54,906
<font color="yellow">I wish Seong Joon can
marry into a good family.</font>

1037
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:58,075
<font color="yellow">I am not certain if I
am talented in singing.</font>

1038
01:06:58,076 --> 01:06:59,146
<font color="yellow">Why wouldn't you be talented?</font>

1039
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:01,046
<font color="yellow">I raised my Chang Soo for 15 years.</font>

1040
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:05,446
<font color="yellow">I didn't know what he likes
or what he is good at.</font>

1041
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:08,406
<font color="yellow">Where did you get this
fermented soybean paste?</font>

1042
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:11,546
<font color="yellow">I was wondering if you remembered
anything before you were adopted.</font>

1043
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:15,076
<font color="yellow">Do you have memories like
your old neighborhood...</font>

1044
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:16,746
<font color="yellow">or your father and brother?</font>
