1
00:00:06,711 --> 00:00:08,440
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,242
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:14,141
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

4
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:17,541
<font color=#FFFF00>- Rock-paper-scissors.</font>

5
00:00:54,371 --> 00:00:55,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

6
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:59,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you?</font>

7
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be...</font>

8
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,371
<font color=#FFFF00>your dad from now on.</font>

9
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:05,641
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

10
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,241
<font color=#FFFF00>From now on,</font>

11
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be your dad.</font>

12
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,011
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

13
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:27,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go home with me.</font>

14
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

15
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on.</font>

16
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I give you a piggyback ride?</font>

17
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,111
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

18
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:01,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on tight.</font>

19
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:43,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's going on?
- I'm in front of...</font>

20
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Attorney Han Seong Sik's home.</font>

21
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,641
<font color=#FFFF00>He already went in a long time ago.</font>

22
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,041
<font color=#FFFF00>- Excuse me? Okay.
- Why don't you call him?</font>

23
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,941
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness.
- He already went in.</font>

24
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Lately, our neighborhood has become noisy.</font>

25
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,741
<font color=#FFFF00>President. Please get in.</font>

26
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

27
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,771
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh.</font>

28
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that Mr. Lee?</font>

29
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,487
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. So the rumor was true after all.</font>

30
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:30,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Lee has all the
power, not President Jo.</font>

31
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you just die?</font>

32
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,940
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'd rather have you dead.
- Mom.</font>

33
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,271
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not what really happened.</font>

34
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,210
<font color=#FFFF00>Please hear my side of the story.</font>

35
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Hear your side? We already read
it in the newspaper and on TV.</font>

36
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would we listen to it again when
we already know what happened, jerk?</font>

37
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,040
<font color=#FFFF00>If you are going to cause
trouble and break our hearts,</font>

38
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,971
<font color=#FFFF00>I'd rather have you dead.
Just go outside and die.</font>

39
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:00,717
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

40
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,587
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really wish that I die?</font>

41
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,910
<font color=#FFFF00>It's better to have a dead son than...</font>

42
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,610
<font color=#FFFF00>have an embarrassing son
who went to prison.</font>

43
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:10,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't go to prison.</font>

44
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I did many things,</font>

45
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,571
<font color=#FFFF00>but I can argue that I didn't
do anything illegal...</font>

46
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,211
<font color=#FFFF00>in the end.</font>

47
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:20,680
<font color=#FFFF00>Then, why are those reporters all
clustered in front of our house?</font>

48
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:24,611
<font color=#FFFF00>It's because they like to exaggerate
and make it into a big deal.</font>

49
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,111
<font color=#FFFF00>- Lower your voice.
- Seong Hoon, shut it.</font>

50
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:28,810
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all your fault.</font>

51
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:30,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I warned you before.</font>

52
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,340
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean this
is Seong Hoon's fault?</font>

53
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Father, well...</font>

54
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik, don't drag Seong Hoon into this.</font>

55
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I lived too long.</font>

56
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,370
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mother, what's wrong?
- It's because I lived too long...</font>

57
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,731
<font color=#FFFF00>that I will end up watching my
grandson get sent to prison.</font>

58
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, I said I won't go to prison.</font>

59
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother. What is all this?</font>

60
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:58,180
<font color=#FFFF00>I packed a few things like
toothbrush, toothpaste, and towels.</font>

61
00:04:58,181 --> 00:04:59,871
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't have much time.</font>

62
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:02,610
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyung Seop. Send him overseas immediately.</font>

63
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik. You can speak English, right?</font>

64
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:08,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't go to the questioning
by the prosecution and...</font>

65
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,741
<font color=#FFFF00>don't come to Korea. Understood?</font>

66
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:11,487
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

67
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,541
<font color=#FFFF00>You only saw bad things on TV.</font>

68
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:16,740
<font color=#FFFF00>A crook like him is already
banned from leaving the country.</font>

69
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:18,010
<font color=#FFFF00>He's banned.</font>

70
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,941
<font color=#FFFF00>You're his brother. How
can you say such a thing?</font>

71
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:24,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother. Seong Sik went too far
and got involved in a bad deal.</font>

72
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:26,541
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what's going on with
Jang Yoo Ra, the news anchor?</font>

73
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:30,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. What is your relationship with...</font>

74
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Jang Yoo Ra?</font>

75
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:36,740
<font color=#FFFF00>- Grandmother.
- Answer me now!</font>

76
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,270
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother. It's... It's...</font>

77
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:41,070
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing.</font>

78
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:42,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you dare lie to us.</font>

79
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:46,210
<font color=#FFFF00>If it's nothing, why would they
print it on the newspaper?</font>

80
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- You should just go inside.
- I am going to die.</font>

81
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,740
<font color=#FFFF00>I will be the one who dies.</font>

82
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you go to have dinner with this woman?</font>

83
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Did you go to the gym together?</font>

84
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

85
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:03,371
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not true.</font>

86
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,411
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hold on.
- Tell me.</font>

87
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,041
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better tell me right now.</font>

88
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:10,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell you what?</font>

89
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,741
<font color=#FFFF00>This woman.</font>

90
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:18,271
<font color=#FFFF00>What is your relationship with this woman?
I asked you a question!</font>

91
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing is going on between us.</font>

92
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:25,011
<font color=#FFFF00>We just had dinner once and
worked out at the gym once.</font>

93
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:26,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that all?</font>

94
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:29,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. That is all. So what
are you going to do?</font>

95
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:32,841
<font color=#FFFF00>If so, how did your alleged
scandal end up in the newspaper?</font>

96
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:35,441
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't...</font>

97
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,671
<font color=#FFFF00>live...</font>

98
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:41,387
<font color=#FFFF00>because you have humiliated me.</font>

99
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:43,040
<font color=#FFFF00>- I can't live now.
- Wait.</font>

100
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:44,710
<font color=#FFFF00>You are pulling all of my hair out.</font>

101
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I am busy taking care of the children.</font>

102
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:49,370
<font color=#FFFF00>While I looked after the
children, you had an affair?</font>

103
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:52,271
<font color=#FFFF00>- I didn't have an affair.
- Goodness. He's pathetic.</font>

104
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,041
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, what's up with your outfit?</font>

105
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,871
<font color=#FFFF00>I had no choice. There
was a gang of reporters.</font>

106
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I needed a plan to escape.</font>

107
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:06,711
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this? Is this Chang Soo's piano?</font>

108
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:11,947
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

109
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not.</font>

110
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let Hee Sook get away with this.</font>

111
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:19,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Honey.</font>

112
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me right now.</font>

113
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,271
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. I'm going to...
- Hey.</font>

114
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo.</font>

115
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Just for today, you should
hold back your anger.</font>

116
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:32,410
<font color=#FFFF00>- All right.
- Honey. Find my chest, please.</font>

117
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:33,470
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, I will.</font>

118
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,440
<font color=#FFFF00>- I will find it for you.
- I won't let it slide.</font>

119
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:37,741
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

120
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:45,241
<font color=#FFFF00>How can Mother pack a
suitcase for Seong Sik?</font>

121
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:49,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to go inside and lie down.
What are you doing here?</font>

122
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:54,141
<font color=#FFFF00>When is he scheduled to present
himself to the prosecution?</font>

123
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:56,111
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the day after tomorrow.</font>

124
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,811
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to give him a good scolding.</font>

125
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,241
<font color=#FFFF00>He has to pay for his actions
if there is any misconduct.</font>

126
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:04,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey.</font>

127
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:08,171
<font color=#FFFF00>What can we do? How can he
not face the consequences?</font>

128
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,770
<font color=#FFFF00>Appearing on that TV show was the problem.
That was the cause.</font>

129
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,347
<font color=#FFFF00>He should have diligently
pursued his path as a lawyer.</font>

130
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,571
<font color=#FFFF00>That's my point.</font>

131
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

132
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

133
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been?</font>

134
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:32,110
<font color=#FFFF00>The house was in chaos because
of your brother, Seong Sik.</font>

135
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've stayed at home...</font>

136
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:36,047
<font color=#FFFF00>and tried to be of help to your brothers.</font>

137
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:38,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been all this time?</font>

138
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Honey, why are you taking
it out on Seong Joon?</font>

139
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,711
<font color=#FFFF00>If he were here, would his
presence solve this problem?</font>

140
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,111
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, Mother.</font>

141
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:49,441
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. I am incredibly upset.</font>

142
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:01,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

143
00:09:03,371 --> 00:09:06,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be disheartened by
what your mother said.</font>

144
00:09:06,911 --> 00:09:09,441
<font color=#FFFF00>You know she's just upset
because of Seong Sik.</font>

145
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:10,987
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay.</font>

146
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,911
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been taking her anger
out on everyone lately.</font>

147
00:09:15,441 --> 00:09:18,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't take it so hard, okay?</font>

148
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:21,971
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go buy some relaxing
pills for your mom.</font>

149
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:24,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

150
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:28,971
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes?
- Can we talk outside?</font>

151
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:49,781
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter? Did
something happen to you?</font>

152
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:03,971
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

153
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:06,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

154
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:09,281
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

155
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,071
<font color=#FFFF00>- I've got something to tell you.
- What is it?</font>

156
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

157
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:22,541
<font color=#FFFF00>To be honest,</font>

158
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,241
<font color=#FFFF00>I have some questions to ask you.</font>

159
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Ask me anything.</font>

160
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me already.</font>

161
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:38,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't just look at me. Go ahead.</font>

162
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:40,971
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

163
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,811
<font color=#FFFF00>went to the orphanage today.</font>

164
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:45,871
<font color=#FFFF00>The orphanage? What orphanage?</font>

165
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,711
<font color=#FFFF00>The orphanage...</font>

166
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,371
<font color=#FFFF00>you took me from when I was young.</font>

167
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,741
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Joon.
- I remembered my childhood.</font>

168
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,571
<font color=#FFFF00>You came...</font>

169
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,671
<font color=#FFFF00>and told me to come with you one day.</font>

170
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I also remember...</font>

171
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:10,241
<font color=#FFFF00>that you carried me on your back.</font>

172
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:13,210
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth are you talking about?</font>

173
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,941
<font color=#FFFF00>And I remember...</font>

174
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:19,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom cried so sadly on the
first day I got home.</font>

175
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,941
<font color=#FFFF00>- That was...
- And you said this.</font>

176
00:11:23,871 --> 00:11:25,271
<font color=#FFFF00>You said I was your son,</font>

177
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,811
<font color=#FFFF00>and you had me stay in the
orphanage for some reasons...</font>

178
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,371
<font color=#FFFF00>and brought back today.</font>

179
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:35,371
<font color=#FFFF00>I believed that...</font>

180
00:11:36,271 --> 00:11:38,371
<font color=#FFFF00>for my entire life.</font>

181
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:43,941
<font color=#FFFF00>So I've never tried to find...</font>

182
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,471
<font color=#FFFF00>my biological father...</font>

183
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,241
<font color=#FFFF00>or wondered who my biological mother is.</font>

184
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:53,441
<font color=#FFFF00>All I needed was...</font>

185
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,571
<font color=#FFFF00>just you, Dad.</font>

186
00:11:56,911 --> 00:11:59,811
<font color=#FFFF00>- What's wrong with you?
- I still have no father...</font>

187
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,311
<font color=#FFFF00>other than you.</font>

188
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon...</font>

189
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,711
<font color=#FFFF00>But I just want to know...</font>

190
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:12,711
<font color=#FFFF00>who I really am.</font>

191
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I want to know...</font>

192
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:20,041
<font color=#FFFF00>where I am from and how you found me...</font>

193
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:23,611
<font color=#FFFF00>at the orphanage.</font>

194
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:26,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Please just answer these questions.</font>

195
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:31,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Then I'll stay by your side
for the rest of my life,</font>

196
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:34,771
<font color=#FFFF00>no matter what others say about you.</font>

197
00:12:38,141 --> 00:12:40,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll live by your side
just like I have been...</font>

198
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:43,771
<font color=#FFFF00>up until now.</font>

199
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:49,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad,</font>

200
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:55,811
<font color=#FFFF00>I really admire you.</font>

201
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,471
<font color=#FFFF00>And I love you so much.</font>

202
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,571
<font color=#FFFF00>But I need you to answer me.</font>

203
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Who am I?</font>

204
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:18,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you take me home
from the orphanage?</font>

205
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Please tell me.</font>

206
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:25,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad...</font>

207
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:36,987
<font color=#FFFF00>The career women are our
main target customers.</font>

208
00:13:37,011 --> 00:13:40,047
<font color=#FFFF00>As they tend to enjoy
their hobby after work,</font>

209
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:43,711
<font color=#FFFF00>we plan to let them enjoy it
anytime and anywhere as they want.</font>

210
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:45,941
<font color=#FFFF00>What specifically is the concept then?</font>

211
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll elaborate further
on it at the next slide.</font>

212
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:50,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Please turn over the slide.</font>

213
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Dong Hui.</font>

214
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

215
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:02,741
<font color=#FFFF00>As you can see, it's "Night Fitness".</font>

216
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:05,247
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a program to help the ladies...</font>

217
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:06,947
<font color=#FFFF00>who enjoy yoga at night...</font>

218
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,047
<font color=#FFFF00>to have more nicely fit
and colorful bodies.</font>

219
00:14:10,071 --> 00:14:11,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me move on.</font>

220
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:24,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han didn't even
attend the showcase.</font>

221
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,971
<font color=#FFFF00>And why does he have a long face?</font>

222
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,471
<font color=#FFFF00>This is frightening.</font>

223
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:30,941
<font color=#FFFF00>But Director Bang attended.</font>

224
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,271
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need for both
of them to attend it.</font>

225
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:36,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, why is he so depressed?</font>

226
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:38,941
<font color=#FFFF00>- What do you think?
- Goodness.</font>

227
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,471
<font color=#FFFF00>These are the 1st and 2nd episodes
of Writer Choi's scenario. Read it.</font>

228
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,771
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are they already ready?
- I'm worried about Dong Hui.</font>

229
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:49,751
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if she's
working on her scenario.</font>

230
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>

231
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:00,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>

232
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:04,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi already finished the scenario.</font>

233
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

234
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

235
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,110
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think about the idea
to create a new brand line?</font>

236
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:18,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I think that sounds great.</font>

237
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I have high expectations for this
spring and summer collections.</font>

238
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:22,011
<font color=#FFFF00>This way, please.</font>

239
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:31,387
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be distracted at that moment?</font>

240
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:33,141
<font color=#FFFF00>If you're that reluctant to
work, just quit your job.</font>

241
00:15:33,511 --> 00:15:35,571
<font color=#FFFF00>- I am sorry.
- Dong Hui.</font>

242
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:38,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you've become a
great writer or something?</font>

243
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care what you write. Just
don't forget what your job here is.</font>

244
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:44,111
<font color=#FFFF00>You even made me nervous!</font>

245
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,247
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm so sorry.
- Don't you know...</font>

246
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:50,640
<font color=#FFFF00>how important the presentation was to me?</font>

247
00:15:50,641 --> 00:15:54,011
<font color=#FFFF00>You're an assistant. You should
be able to assist us well.</font>

248
00:15:54,811 --> 00:15:57,111
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seriously.
- Dong Hui.</font>

249
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director Han.</font>

250
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, I need you to come with me.</font>

251
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you taking her?</font>

252
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:11,141
<font color=#FFFF00>We have a meeting with the director
at the broadcasting station. Okay?</font>

253
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:13,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

254
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is he holding her wrist like that?</font>

255
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:25,471
<font color=#FFFF00>What's gotten into him?</font>

256
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I think there's something going on...</font>

257
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:29,841
<font color=#FFFF00>between the two.</font>

258
00:16:31,141 --> 00:16:32,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Shoot.</font>

259
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:40,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Director Han?</font>

260
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, I saw him leaving.</font>

261
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:44,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Director,</font>

262
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:48,341
<font color=#FFFF00>he went to the broadcasting
station with Dong Hui.</font>

263
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:49,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

264
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are we here?</font>

265
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:03,241
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't go to a hotel, though.</font>

266
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:04,541
<font color=#FFFF00>A hotel?</font>

267
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:06,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

268
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:11,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, have some sleep.</font>

269
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,541
<font color=#FFFF00>You stayed up all night
writing the scenario, right?</font>

270
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,611
<font color=#FFFF00>- How did you know that?
- What do you think?</font>

271
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:22,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I went up to the rooftop.</font>

272
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:24,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Why were you awake at that time?</font>

273
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,371
<font color=#FFFF00>I had trouble sleeping.</font>

274
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you find out anything at the orphanage?</font>

275
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:35,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Well,</font>

276
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,771
<font color=#FFFF00>nothing special happened.</font>

277
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,041
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? You went all
the way there for a reason.</font>

278
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:44,311
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't want to ask anything to anybody.</font>

279
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,941
<font color=#FFFF00>What matters the most is how I feel inside.</font>

280
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:51,041
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why you couldn't
sleep last night at all.</font>

281
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:54,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

282
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:08,141
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

283
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,841
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel sorry for you, Director.</font>

284
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:17,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I know how hard and painful it is.</font>

285
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:21,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you. I also grew
up without my parents,</font>

286
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:24,811
<font color=#FFFF00>so I had to create my
parents in my imagination.</font>

287
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:28,671
<font color=#FFFF00>But I had my grandmother with me,</font>

288
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:32,271
<font color=#FFFF00>and you had your parents.</font>

289
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,771
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess we are blessed enough.</font>

290
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,111
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't be too depressed.</font>

291
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:44,611
<font color=#FFFF00>It feels nice.</font>

292
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

293
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:48,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Your hand.</font>

294
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:56,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say you thought of me as Moong Chi.</font>

295
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:25,611
<font color=#FFFF00>The lunch hour will end soon.
Have some sleep.</font>

296
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:28,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

297
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:30,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Close your eyes.</font>

298
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:36,787
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not allowed to open your
eyes for the next one hour.</font>

299
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,981
<font color=#FFFF00>If you do, I'll be really mad at you.</font>

300
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,741
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, would Moong
Chi be doing all right?</font>

301
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:46,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you talking about
her out of the blue?</font>

302
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,171
<font color=#FFFF00>As I closed my eyes,</font>

303
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:51,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I see Moong Chi, who is as white as snow.</font>

304
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you really think about Moong
Chi when you patted my head?</font>

305
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Dong Hui.</font>

306
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:04,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Sleep tight.</font>

307
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:07,981
<font color=#FFFF00>It served drinks and meat until recently.</font>

308
00:21:09,741 --> 00:21:10,811
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not bad.</font>

309
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out. Now.</font>

310
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han.</font>

311
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

312
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:25,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Come out.</font>

313
00:21:26,771 --> 00:21:28,981
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han. Mr. Han!</font>

314
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:31,870
<font color=#FFFF00>What's wrong with you?</font>

315
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:35,140
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you tell Seong Joon? Tell me now.</font>

316
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,311
<font color=#FFFF00>I just told him the truth.</font>

317
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:38,641
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

318
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:41,617
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I didn't tell
him the crucial part.</font>

319
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you doing this to me?</font>

320
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:46,457
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you show up all of a
sudden and interfere with my life?</font>

321
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,480
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you...</font>

322
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,741
<font color=#FFFF00>to help me since we used
to be close before.</font>

323
00:21:51,481 --> 00:21:53,210
<font color=#FFFF00>You were on a roll...</font>

324
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,170
<font color=#FFFF00>as you were working for
a large firm back then.</font>

325
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Your house was the most
expensive in this neighborhood.</font>

326
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:00,871
<font color=#FFFF00>It's become quite shabby now, though.</font>

327
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,571
<font color=#FFFF00>I need more money.</font>

328
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,671
<font color=#FFFF00>They asked me to pay a premium
even for that small store.</font>

329
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to sign the contract today.</font>

330
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:12,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Although Seong Joon gave me
some money, it's not enough.</font>

331
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:14,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you ask him for money?</font>

332
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:17,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Why? Is there anything wrong with it?</font>

333
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't give me money,
so your son did for you.</font>

334
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really want to get nasty?</font>

335
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it.</font>

336
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:30,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Director, Director Bang
was looking for you.</font>

337
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I know. We talked on the phone.</font>

338
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:35,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui,</font>

339
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:39,740
<font color=#FFFF00>where have you been through the lunch time?</font>

340
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:42,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, I need you to revise
the scenario according to...</font>

341
00:22:42,871 --> 00:22:45,191
<font color=#FFFF00>the director's opinions and
hand it in as soon as you can.</font>

342
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:47,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I will.</font>

343
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,971
<font color=#FFFF00>I guess they really had a meeting.</font>

344
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Director, you have a guest.</font>

345
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,211
<font color=#FFFF00>A guest?</font>

346
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

347
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:07,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry...</font>

348
00:23:07,711 --> 00:23:09,611
<font color=#FFFF00>for waiting in an empty office.</font>

349
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:11,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Please excuse me.</font>

350
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:13,441
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

351
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:14,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's sit down first.</font>

352
00:23:26,771 --> 00:23:29,411
<font color=#FFFF00>So you decided to add the secret
behind the birth to the scenario.</font>

353
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:31,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Our writer went through some trouble.</font>

354
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:35,971
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no writer who
don't work hard like her.</font>

355
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:40,111
<font color=#FFFF00>The reason I came here...</font>

356
00:23:40,271 --> 00:23:41,811
<font color=#FFFF00>is to discuss about the casting.</font>

357
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:44,211
<font color=#FFFF00>- Casting?
- Yes.</font>

358
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:47,611
<font color=#FFFF00>I selected some.</font>

359
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:56,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't they members of idol groups?</font>

360
00:23:56,941 --> 00:24:00,211
<font color=#FFFF00>They're very popular which
will secure the high ratings.</font>

361
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:03,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Now, you are...</font>

362
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:05,941
<font color=#FFFF00>meddling in casting matter as well?</font>

363
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:10,641
<font color=#FFFF00>They don't have any
acting experience at all.</font>

364
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:13,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sure they can learn through this drama.</font>

365
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, why are they so serious?</font>

366
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:24,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he fighting with the investor?</font>

367
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:37,641
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going then.</font>

368
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,041
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee.</font>

369
00:24:45,771 --> 00:24:47,571
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't keep doing this.</font>

370
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:51,571
<font color=#FFFF00>As I told you earlier,</font>

371
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:56,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll exert my right as much
as I invested as an investor.</font>

372
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't feel too bad.</font>

373
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Please take my opinion into consideration.</font>

374
00:25:03,071 --> 00:25:04,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

375
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:07,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me who you really are.</font>

376
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:14,471
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

377
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:16,941
<font color=#FFFF00>did you just say?</font>

378
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:19,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I asked who you really are.</font>

379
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon,</font>

380
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,871
<font color=#FFFF00>do you really not know who I am?</font>

381
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:31,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

382
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:34,741
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a investor of our project
and live across from my house.</font>

383
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:39,911
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't going to mention this,</font>

384
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:41,511
<font color=#FFFF00>but do you know...</font>

385
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:43,771
<font color=#FFFF00>what kind of situation Seong Sik is in?</font>

386
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Does it...</font>

387
00:25:46,841 --> 00:25:49,171
<font color=#FFFF00>have anything to do with me?</font>

388
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,111
<font color=#FFFF00>There must be a misunderstanding.</font>

389
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,670
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik begged me for help,</font>

390
00:25:56,671 --> 00:25:58,541
<font color=#FFFF00>so I just introduced him to others.</font>

391
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:01,141
<font color=#FFFF00>That was my good will.</font>

392
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:04,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Do I have to be criticized for that?</font>

393
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I did it for him out of
good will, and that was it.</font>

394
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:11,841
<font color=#FFFF00>The one to be blamed is Seong Sik...</font>

395
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,441
<font color=#FFFF00>who crossed the line, isn't it?</font>

396
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:20,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not bring the private
issues to the work.</font>

397
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,371
<font color=#FFFF00>You're not that naive.</font>

398
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:41,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

399
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

400
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- He's here!
- He's here.</font>

401
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:19,040
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get to know
President Lee of Seonghan?</font>

402
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,610
<font color=#FFFF00>You've become an official
candidate of Minjeong Party.</font>

403
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,910
<font color=#FFFF00>There's a rumor that you
were nominated in return...</font>

404
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:26,751
<font color=#FFFF00>for being engaged in the collusion
between Seonghan and Minjeong Party.</font>

405
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:32,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I... I will...</font>

406
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,371
<font color=#FFFF00>tell...</font>

407
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:37,041
<font color=#FFFF00>everything...</font>

408
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:38,741
<font color=#FFFF00>to the prosecution.</font>

409
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:41,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to get going.</font>

410
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:45,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you aware that Jang Yoo
Ra is getting married soon?</font>

411
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:47,810
<font color=#FFFF00>- Pardon?
- Jang Yoo Ra said...</font>

412
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,610
<font color=#FFFF00>she plans to file a libel suit against you.</font>

413
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,710
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know about this?</font>

414
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry? Is Yoo Ra...</font>

415
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:57,641
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean, is Anchor Jang...</font>

416
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,441
<font color=#FFFF00>really getting married?</font>

417
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,847
<font color=#FFFF00>Seoul Central Prosecutor's
Office charged President Lee...</font>

418
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,710
<font color=#FFFF00>of Seonghan without detention...</font>

419
00:28:06,711 --> 00:28:09,711
<font color=#FFFF00>for providing a slush
fund to Minjeong Party.</font>

420
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:12,540
<font color=#FFFF00>The prosecution also summoned
Attorney Han Seong Sik...</font>

421
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:14,811
<font color=#FFFF00>to be questioned as a testifier.</font>

422
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:18,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Attorney Han told the reporters...</font>

423
00:28:18,011 --> 00:28:21,317
<font color=#FFFF00>that he will tell everything
to the prosecution...</font>

424
00:28:21,341 --> 00:28:23,071
<font color=#FFFF00>before he entered the building.</font>

425
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,770
<font color=#FFFF00>The Korean Bar Association stated,</font>

426
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:29,641
<font color=#FFFF00>it submitted Attorney Han's
scandals regarding...</font>

427
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:33,441
<font color=#FFFF00>the illegal advice and the
relationship with Anchor Jang...</font>

428
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:36,371
<font color=#FFFF00>- to the Ethic Committee.
- This is driving me crazy.</font>

429
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,270
<font color=#FFFF00>He loved to appear on television so much,</font>

430
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,641
<font color=#FFFF00>and his dream has come true today.</font>

431
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:43,440
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't handle this, Mother.</font>

432
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:46,647
<font color=#FFFF00>But he said he did nothing illicit.</font>

433
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Still...</font>

434
00:28:49,341 --> 00:28:51,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, are you all right?</font>

435
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, Mother.</font>

436
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:57,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

437
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,571
<font color=#FFFF00>I should...</font>

438
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:01,140
<font color=#FFFF00>leave now.</font>

439
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

440
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:08,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, don't be too sad.</font>

441
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:15,440
<font color=#FFFF00>What if they get a divorce?</font>

442
00:29:15,441 --> 00:29:18,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I am really worried about that, Mother.</font>

443
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:20,571
<font color=#FFFF00>So am I. Goodness.</font>

444
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:33,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

445
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

446
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:41,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, Chang Soo.</font>

447
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:45,511
<font color=#FFFF00>- Did your piano teacher leave?
- She just left.</font>

448
00:29:46,311 --> 00:29:47,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

449
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,371
<font color=#FFFF00>What's happening with Dad?</font>

450
00:29:51,111 --> 00:29:53,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone's talking about
him on the internet.</font>

451
00:29:53,871 --> 00:29:54,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo.</font>

452
00:29:55,611 --> 00:29:58,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you not to go online while
playing the piano, didn't I?</font>

453
00:29:58,771 --> 00:30:00,211
<font color=#FFFF00>My friend called me.</font>

454
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:05,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, what will you do about Dad?</font>

455
00:30:06,211 --> 00:30:08,841
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean what will I do about him?</font>

456
00:30:09,211 --> 00:30:10,271
<font color=#FFFF00>First,</font>

457
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I should send you kids to college.</font>

458
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:17,271
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Let's study now.</font>

459
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:19,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your room and bring out your books.</font>

460
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:21,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

461
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,011
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing, kids?</font>

462
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:33,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

463
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Pack up your books and come upstairs.</font>

464
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:43,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Hurry up. Sit down and open your books.</font>

465
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:48,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind what's going on in the family.</font>

466
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:52,311
<font color=#FFFF00>It's the adults' business, and
the adults will take care of it.</font>

467
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:55,341
<font color=#FFFF00>As high school students...</font>

468
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:58,641
<font color=#FFFF00>and as a preschool student,</font>

469
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:01,441
<font color=#FFFF00>you should carry out your duties.</font>

470
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:05,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Just mind your own business.
Do you understand?</font>

471
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:06,671
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

472
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:09,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon, why aren't you answering?</font>

473
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon. Ji Hoon.</font>

474
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:15,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you have to do this?</font>

475
00:31:16,971 --> 00:31:18,111
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean?</font>

476
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Do we have to study like this?</font>

477
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,741
<font color=#FFFF00>We are not prisoners.</font>

478
00:31:23,911 --> 00:31:26,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Until when do we have to
study under your watch?</font>

479
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:29,811
<font color=#FFFF00>You know the answer. It's until
you get into college, of course.</font>

480
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,741
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't study unless
you are being watched.</font>

481
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:36,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we solve our own problems, too?</font>

482
00:31:37,141 --> 00:31:38,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- Ji Hoon,</font>

483
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,941
<font color=#FFFF00>just be quiet and study.</font>

484
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,911
<font color=#FFFF00>You be quiet. Since when did you
become so keen on studying?</font>

485
00:31:45,171 --> 00:31:48,470
<font color=#FFFF00>You're so annoying these days.</font>

486
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,141
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you say?
- Ji Hoon,</font>

487
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,241
<font color=#FFFF00>you should study when I tell you nicely.</font>

488
00:31:54,141 --> 00:31:57,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you talking back to me every
time I tell you to do something?</font>

489
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,247
<font color=#FFFF00>So just tell your son to study...</font>

490
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:03,711
<font color=#FFFF00>- and play the piano.
- Han Ji Hoon!</font>

491
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:06,841
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you talk to Mom like that?</font>

492
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,141
<font color=#FFFF00>- Chang Soo.
- Just raise your son well.</font>

493
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:13,571
<font color=#FFFF00>What? "Just raise your son well"?</font>

494
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:15,941
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

495
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,941
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you done?
- No, I am not.</font>

496
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:21,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not done.</font>

497
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:24,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I am so sick of this.</font>

498
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:26,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Just raise your son Chang Soo well.</font>

499
00:32:28,341 --> 00:32:29,341
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

500
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:34,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. What's going on?</font>

501
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:35,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon.</font>

502
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:42,171
<font color=#FFFF00>You guys go downstairs, too.</font>

503
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,941
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay.
- Okay.</font>

504
00:32:55,111 --> 00:32:56,371
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to talk to you.</font>

505
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:59,241
<font color=#FFFF00>I have nothing to say. You should go...</font>

506
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:01,711
<font color=#FFFF00>and talk to Ji Hoon.</font>

507
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:04,911
<font color=#FFFF00>I have too many things to say to you.</font>

508
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,071
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all,</font>

509
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:11,411
<font color=#FFFF00>the chest I inherited from my parents,</font>

510
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:13,571
<font color=#FFFF00>it used to sit where the piano is.</font>

511
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:19,271
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you sell it without
discussing it with me?</font>

512
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:21,487
<font color=#FFFF00>I discussed it with you, didn't I?</font>

513
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:23,671
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you discuss it with me?</font>

514
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:27,011
<font color=#FFFF00>You just informed me your
plan and carried it out.</font>

515
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:32,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, who do you think you are
to force my kids to study?</font>

516
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:35,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Your son is the boy who
puts oil on his hair,</font>

517
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:40,017
<font color=#FFFF00>uses his dad's toner,</font>

518
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:42,770
<font color=#FFFF00>and eats a piece of bean as a snack.</font>

519
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,311
<font color=#FFFF00>You are that boy's mother.</font>

520
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,871
<font color=#FFFF00>So I beg you.</font>

521
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,740
<font color=#FFFF00>You should differentiate
your child from mine,</font>

522
00:33:49,741 --> 00:33:51,147
<font color=#FFFF00>and stop intruding on our privacy.</font>

523
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,971
<font color=#FFFF00>But we live in the same house,
and I see them all the time.</font>

524
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,071
<font color=#FFFF00>When I see Ji Hoon and Ah In play,</font>

525
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:01,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I can clearly see how they
will turn out in the future.</font>

526
00:34:01,441 --> 00:34:03,771
<font color=#FFFF00>So how can I just watch them?</font>

527
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:07,671
<font color=#FFFF00>How do you know what will become
of them when they grow up?</font>

528
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:12,141
<font color=#FFFF00>There's only one thing they can
become of when they play like that.</font>

529
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:15,787
<font color=#FFFF00>A loser. A loser.</font>

530
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:17,171
<font color=#FFFF00>They will be a failure.</font>

531
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:20,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What?</font>

532
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,911
<font color=#FFFF00>A loser? A failure?</font>

533
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:27,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I wasn't going to say this,
but I guess I have to.</font>

534
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:31,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Look what happened to your winner husband.</font>

535
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:35,971
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you trying to say?</font>

536
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,987
<font color=#FFFF00>Your husband was a great
student all along his life,</font>

537
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:41,210
<font color=#FFFF00>and he managed to enter a good
college and become a lawyer.</font>

538
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:44,881
<font color=#FFFF00>But what happened to your
successful husband? What?</font>

539
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:48,247
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the point of being smart?
He uses his smart brain...</font>

540
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:50,917
<font color=#FFFF00>to do everything illegal.</font>

541
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:53,970
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo.
- I'm sorry to offend you,</font>

542
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:55,611
<font color=#FFFF00>but you need to know the truth.</font>

543
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:59,911
<font color=#FFFF00>In my opinion, those who
used to be good students...</font>

544
00:35:00,011 --> 00:35:02,011
<font color=#FFFF00>commit more bad things in life.</font>

545
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:06,511
<font color=#FFFF00>They harm more people, too!
Do you know that?</font>

546
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:10,381
<font color=#FFFF00>He got involved in this...</font>

547
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:13,271
<font color=#FFFF00>because he wasn't smart enough.</font>

548
00:35:13,971 --> 00:35:15,311
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What did you say?</font>

549
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:19,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Had he studied harder and
graduated first in his class,</font>

550
00:35:20,471 --> 00:35:24,341
<font color=#FFFF00>he would've gotten picked
up by a famous law firm.</font>

551
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:27,271
<font color=#FFFF00>If he was a part of a big law firm,</font>

552
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:31,171
<font color=#FFFF00>he wouldn't have gotten into
such trouble so helplessly.</font>

553
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:36,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, you are really sick, aren't you?</font>

554
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Never mind. Let's stop this. I
need to get the kids to study.</font>

555
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:42,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, you can't go.</font>

556
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:44,611
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me.</font>

557
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,671
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't go!</font>

558
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:48,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hye Joo!
- What?</font>

559
00:35:49,471 --> 00:35:50,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

560
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:54,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help us, Mr. Lee.</font>

561
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,381
<font color=#FFFF00>Please help my brother.</font>

562
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm in a difficult position.</font>

563
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:05,711
<font color=#FFFF00>- I shouldn't have introduced them.
- No.</font>

564
00:36:06,441 --> 00:36:10,211
<font color=#FFFF00>I know that you meant well.
It's him who messed up.</font>

565
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:14,971
<font color=#FFFF00>He jumped into it without knowing
that it was going to kill him.</font>

566
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,271
<font color=#FFFF00>He's an idiot.</font>

567
00:36:19,941 --> 00:36:22,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know how I can help him.</font>

568
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:26,071
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard...</font>

569
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:29,341
<font color=#FFFF00>that you are no ordinary person.</font>

570
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:33,541
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- When you have those connections,</font>

571
00:36:34,881 --> 00:36:37,741
<font color=#FFFF00>you can't just be a construction manager.</font>

572
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:44,641
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry.</font>

573
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:47,171
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't mean to trick you.</font>

574
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:51,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I am running an investment
company in the US.</font>

575
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:54,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I was looking for other
investment opportunities,</font>

576
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:56,831
<font color=#FFFF00>and I developed interest in
Korean real estate market.</font>

577
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:00,811
<font color=#FFFF00>No wonder.</font>

578
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:04,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought acting like a rich person...</font>

579
00:37:04,571 --> 00:37:06,941
<font color=#FFFF00>would just attrack scammers.</font>

580
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I apologize if I have offended you.</font>

581
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:15,111
<font color=#FFFF00>No, there's no need for you to apologize.</font>

582
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:19,041
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

583
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:23,741
<font color=#FFFF00>please help my brother Seong Sik.</font>

584
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:30,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I did provide the cause after all.</font>

585
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:33,641
<font color=#FFFF00>So I will look into it.</font>

586
00:37:35,441 --> 00:37:38,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. Lee.</font>

587
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:46,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if he avoids the criminal punishment,</font>

588
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:50,511
<font color=#FFFF00>he will still have to pay the fine
and get his license suspended.</font>

589
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:53,811
<font color=#FFFF00>There's also the affair with Jang Yoo Ra.</font>

590
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:57,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that enough...</font>

591
00:37:57,911 --> 00:38:00,141
<font color=#FFFF00>to make him lose his place in the society?</font>

592
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:03,881
<font color=#FFFF00>He won't be able to go on TV anymore,</font>

593
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:07,111
<font color=#FFFF00>and he will no longer be a lawyer.</font>

594
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:09,671
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true.</font>

595
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:11,241
<font color=#FFFF00>We still have to be...</font>

596
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,711
<font color=#FFFF00>good neighbors to them.</font>

597
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:19,271
<font color=#FFFF00>We're not after...</font>

598
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,041
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Sik anyway.
- Right.</font>

599
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:28,541
<font color=#FFFF00>I am tired. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

600
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:30,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

601
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:34,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you really want to get rid of...</font>

602
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:38,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun's coffee shop?</font>

603
00:38:39,471 --> 00:38:41,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't I tell you to do that?</font>

604
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:43,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Sir.</font>

605
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:26,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Did she leave Korea again?</font>

606
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,211
<font color=#FFFF00>It's as if three years of wandering
wasn't enough. Where did she go?</font>

607
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:44,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Open your heart to me</font>

608
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,541
<font color=#FFFF00>My dear Ae Ri</font>

609
00:39:52,471 --> 00:39:55,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't sing without an accompaniment.</font>

610
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:07,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I have dreamed thee too long</font>

611
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:11,540
<font color=#FFFF00>But known thee</font>

612
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,911
<font color=#FFFF00>- With all of my heart - What is this now?</font>

613
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:17,170
<font color=#FFFF00>This jerk.</font>

614
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:21,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this a dream?</font>

615
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:24,817
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to know</font>

616
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:30,141
<font color=#FFFF00>If this is a reality or not</font>

617
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:38,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

618
00:40:38,211 --> 00:40:42,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

619
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:47,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I see heaven when I see thee</font>

620
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:51,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

621
00:40:52,041 --> 00:40:57,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Thy name is like a prayer</font>

622
00:40:57,541 --> 00:41:01,971
<font color=#FFFF00>An angel whispers</font>

623
00:41:02,341 --> 00:41:07,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

624
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:13,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

625
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:19,210
<font color=#FFFF00>If I reach out to thee,
do not tremble and shrink</font>

626
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:26,711
<font color=#FFFF00>From the touch of my hand on thy hair</font>

627
00:41:28,641 --> 00:41:33,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this a dream?</font>

628
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,270
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want to know</font>

629
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:41,271
<font color=#FFFF00>If this is a reality or not</font>

630
00:41:41,941 --> 00:41:48,087
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dulcinea - Accompany us to the station.</font>

631
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:52,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I have lived for thee</font>

632
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:55,040
<font color=#FFFF00>Dulcinea</font>

633
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:58,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Lock him up well so that
he never comes back.</font>

634
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:01,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if they do, they can't
imprison my love for you.</font>

635
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri. Wait for me. I
will be back tomorrow.</font>

636
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:06,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Good night.</font>

637
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:08,341
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

638
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:11,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Let go of me. I will go myself.</font>

639
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:23,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

640
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you.</font>

641
00:42:34,741 --> 00:42:37,417
<font color=#FFFF00>Has he gone crazy?</font>

642
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:40,341
<font color=#FFFF00>It's so embarrassing. How
can he do this every night?</font>

643
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:51,271
<font color=#FFFF00>The more I think about it, I can't
leave like this. This is so unfair.</font>

644
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:53,540
<font color=#FFFF00>I've already said this so many times.</font>

645
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,640
<font color=#FFFF00>I have given him my everything.</font>

646
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,271
<font color=#FFFF00>He's going to treat me like this?
I can't let him do that.</font>

647
00:42:58,441 --> 00:43:00,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't let him.</font>

648
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:04,541
<font color=#FFFF00>- Ma'am.
- You startled me.</font>

649
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:08,641
<font color=#FFFF00>I will call you right back, Ma'am.</font>

650
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,540
<font color=#FFFF00>What's up with you?</font>

651
00:43:11,541 --> 00:43:13,940
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you say you were leaving?
Why are you still here?</font>

652
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:15,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't leave.</font>

653
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:16,440
<font color=#FFFF00>Why?</font>

654
00:43:16,441 --> 00:43:18,441
<font color=#FFFF00>I've thought about it for
two days at the airport.</font>

655
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:21,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't leave because
this is unfair for me.</font>

656
00:43:21,841 --> 00:43:23,910
<font color=#FFFF00>What is so unfair for you?</font>

657
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:25,017
<font color=#FFFF00>There are a few things.</font>

658
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:27,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, don't sell my coffee shop.</font>

659
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:29,271
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to continue with it.</font>

660
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:33,441
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you talking about? An
interested tenant has surfaced.</font>

661
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:35,541
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

662
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Look here.</font>

663
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Speak of the devil.</font>

664
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:00,971
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

665
00:44:04,471 --> 00:44:06,641
<font color=#FFFF00>President. It's Jeong Eun.</font>

666
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:08,011
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm looking at her, too.</font>

667
00:44:08,341 --> 00:44:10,370
<font color=#FFFF00>"One runs into one's worst enemy
at the worst place and time."</font>

668
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,811
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad I ran into you.</font>

669
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:15,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Get off right now. We need to talk.</font>

670
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:19,371
<font color=#FFFF00>President.</font>

671
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's go.</font>

672
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,911
<font color=#FFFF00>They are such jerks.</font>

673
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:40,341
<font color=#FFFF00>To be frank,</font>

674
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun called me this morning.</font>

675
00:44:45,111 --> 00:44:48,471
<font color=#FFFF00>She demanded compensation
for recent happenings.</font>

676
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:51,441
<font color=#FFFF00>She said she won't let
you get away with this.</font>

677
00:44:53,241 --> 00:44:54,841
<font color=#FFFF00>What did she ask for?</font>

678
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:58,541
<font color=#FFFF00>She demanded to give her the coffee shop.</font>

679
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:01,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Let her have it.</font>

680
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:03,971
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay, Sir.</font>

681
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:06,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so?</font>

682
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I do that?</font>

683
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:11,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I understand.</font>

684
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:13,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Please do what I have asked you.</font>

685
00:45:13,971 --> 00:45:14,971
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

686
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I took care of it.</font>

687
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,541
<font color=#FFFF00>President.</font>

688
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:23,241
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm glad...</font>

689
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:25,941
<font color=#FFFF00>that she is still brave.</font>

690
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:33,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. You are unbelievable.</font>

691
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:36,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you a thug? How can
you steal his property?</font>

692
00:45:36,371 --> 00:45:39,641
<font color=#FFFF00>He gave it to me and I will
take it because I deserve it.</font>

693
00:45:41,211 --> 00:45:42,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun.</font>

694
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:45,317
<font color=#FFFF00>You know President Jo
Moo Gyeom and Mr. Lee?</font>

695
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:46,710
<font color=#FFFF00>They seem strange.</font>

696
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,741
<font color=#FFFF00>How strange?</font>

697
00:45:48,071 --> 00:45:51,711
<font color=#FFFF00>At some point, there was a weird rumor.</font>

698
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:54,071
<font color=#FFFF00>The rumor was it was Mr. Lee who
bought all the properties...</font>

699
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,711
<font color=#FFFF00>in this neighborhood, not President Jo.</font>

700
00:45:57,141 --> 00:45:58,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Pardon?</font>

701
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:01,971
<font color=#FFFF00>It was Hyun Woo who bought
all the properties here?</font>

702
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:03,340
<font color=#FFFF00>That's what I'm saying.</font>

703
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:05,841
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I said you are unbelievable.</font>

704
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:08,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone lost their property to Mr. Lee,</font>

705
00:46:08,471 --> 00:46:10,641
<font color=#FFFF00>but you managed to take one from Mr. Lee.</font>

706
00:46:12,071 --> 00:46:14,641
<font color=#FFFF00>There's something fishy about Mr. Lee.</font>

707
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:16,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so?</font>

708
00:46:16,471 --> 00:46:19,110
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he have to pretend
to be a manager...</font>

709
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:21,711
<font color=#FFFF00>on a construction site
in this neighborhood?</font>

710
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:24,071
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he pretend to belong
to the working class?</font>

711
00:46:24,371 --> 00:46:26,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he hide his identity?</font>

712
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:28,171
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not all.</font>

713
00:46:28,341 --> 00:46:30,071
<font color=#FFFF00>After he moved into the neighborhood,</font>

714
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:32,641
<font color=#FFFF00>a lot of weird things happened here.</font>

715
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:35,111
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Mal Ja even
performed an exorcism.</font>

716
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:36,641
<font color=#FFFF00>She performed an exorcism?</font>

717
00:46:36,741 --> 00:46:37,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, she did.</font>

718
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,970
<font color=#FFFF00>She said the spirit of the driver
who got into a car accident...</font>

719
00:46:40,971 --> 00:46:43,641
<font color=#FFFF00>came to our neighborhood.</font>

720
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:46,811
<font color=#FFFF00>She said one of his sons
came to take revenge on her.</font>

721
00:46:46,941 --> 00:46:50,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me? What did you just say?</font>

722
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,171
<font color=#FFFF00>What accident and what revenge?</font>

723
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:55,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you remember at all?</font>

724
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:59,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Your cousin, Jeong Hwa was badly hurt.</font>

725
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:12,911
<font color=#FFFF00>The driver...</font>

726
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:16,171
<font color=#FFFF00>ended up hanging himself with his tie.</font>

727
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:18,241
<font color=#FFFF00>The case was settled.</font>

728
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:21,641
<font color=#FFFF00>The driver had two sons.</font>

729
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:25,371
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard both of them were
sent to the orphanage.</font>

730
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:28,571
<font color=#FFFF00>No one knows what happened
to them afterward.</font>

731
00:47:29,811 --> 00:47:32,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Mal Ja's claim is that his son
came to have his revenge.</font>

732
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:38,841
<font color=#FFFF00>A driver who committed suicide.</font>

733
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:40,941
<font color=#FFFF00>And two sons.</font>

734
00:47:50,711 --> 00:47:53,441
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have been blinded by love.</font>

735
00:47:55,741 --> 00:47:58,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't see what was
right in front of me...</font>

736
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:00,341
<font color=#FFFF00>because of a guy.</font>

737
00:48:06,271 --> 00:48:08,371
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave immediately with this.</font>

738
00:48:09,441 --> 00:48:10,911
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't ever show your face here.</font>

739
00:48:12,971 --> 00:48:14,571
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't understand this.</font>

740
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:18,240
<font color=#FFFF00>Just tell Seong Joon that he is...</font>

741
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:19,417
<font color=#FFFF00>the son of the driver.</font>

742
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:22,070
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not like you killed him.
Why are you hiding it?</font>

743
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut it.</font>

744
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:24,841
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you.</font>

745
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon has reached a marriageable age.</font>

746
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:32,540
<font color=#FFFF00>All he has to do now is to get married,</font>

747
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,741
<font color=#FFFF00>have children, and live a happy life.</font>

748
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:36,841
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to...</font>

749
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:40,141
<font color=#FFFF00>hurt him by bringing up his past.</font>

750
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:42,917
<font color=#FFFF00>The same applies to my family.</font>

751
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:45,811
<font color=#FFFF00>But still. You shouldn't have told
him he was born out of wedlock.</font>

752
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:48,840
<font color=#FFFF00>Your wife must have given you a hard time.</font>

753
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:50,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Leave now.</font>

754
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:52,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go back where you came from.</font>

755
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:54,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

756
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:56,741
<font color=#FFFF00>that alcoholic man...</font>

757
00:48:57,141 --> 00:48:59,340
<font color=#FFFF00>came to drink to my bar
and drank on credit.</font>

758
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:01,917
<font color=#FFFF00>I fed the children, but he
never paid for the food.</font>

759
00:49:01,941 --> 00:49:03,911
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother and I were really annoyed.</font>

760
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Who knew that he was going
to help us after 20 years?</font>

761
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,711
<font color=#FFFF00>If I had known, I would've
fed them more food.</font>

762
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:15,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you still not know what happened
to Seong Joon's older brother?</font>

763
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you remember? He
had an older brother.</font>

764
00:49:24,841 --> 00:49:26,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I'm going now.</font>

765
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:28,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't show up again, so don't worry.</font>

766
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:45,471
<font color=#FFFF00>It's even hard to eat now, Mother.</font>

767
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,741
<font color=#FFFF00>You still have to eat. Come on.
Scoop some rice.</font>

768
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:51,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

769
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:55,671
<font color=#FFFF00>It will arouse your appetite. Eat
up and get your strength back.</font>

770
00:49:57,141 --> 00:50:00,387
<font color=#FFFF00>Where did Hyung Seop go
at a time like this?</font>

771
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:02,117
<font color=#FFFF00>I haven't seen him all day.</font>

772
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:03,670
<font color=#FFFF00>I know, right?</font>

773
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:07,341
<font color=#FFFF00>He's so busy these days. He
hasn't been of any help.</font>

774
00:50:09,711 --> 00:50:10,741
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel...</font>

775
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,870
<font color=#FFFF00>so ashamed to face Ms. Oh.</font>

776
00:50:13,871 --> 00:50:15,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't mind her.</font>

777
00:50:15,741 --> 00:50:19,141
<font color=#FFFF00>How can I not mind her? She's
a very streetwise person.</font>

778
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:23,871
<font color=#FFFF00>She's seeing a man these days. She
always goes out to cook him meals.</font>

779
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:25,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Where does she go?</font>

780
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:35,311
<font color=#FFFF00>You should eat slowly.</font>

781
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:38,340
<font color=#FFFF00>Although you're an old man with gray hair,</font>

782
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:41,841
<font color=#FFFF00>you eat just like how you used
to eat when you were little.</font>

783
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:43,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Mom.</font>

784
00:50:45,341 --> 00:50:48,111
<font color=#FFFF00>It's hard to change one's eating habits.</font>

785
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, I had gray hair...</font>

786
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:53,541
<font color=#FFFF00>since I was in high school.</font>

787
00:50:54,511 --> 00:50:56,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Even so, try to eat slowly.</font>

788
00:50:56,941 --> 00:51:00,341
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a middle-aged man with gray hair.
It makes you look crude.</font>

789
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:04,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. Now that I don't have a wife,</font>

790
00:51:05,471 --> 00:51:07,711
<font color=#FFFF00>you're nagging me instead.</font>

791
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,111
<font color=#FFFF00>I always wanted to ask you this.</font>

792
00:51:12,211 --> 00:51:15,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did your wife die so young?</font>

793
00:51:18,841 --> 00:51:23,241
<font color=#FFFF00>After a few years of struggle
with pancreatic cancer, she died.</font>

794
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:28,471
<font color=#FFFF00>It was when Mi Joo was in high school.</font>

795
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:32,111
<font color=#FFFF00>It was hard on both Mi Joo and me.</font>

796
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:36,641
<font color=#FFFF00>My mother, that old grump,
used to be so mean...</font>

797
00:51:36,941 --> 00:51:38,871
<font color=#FFFF00>to my wife.</font>

798
00:51:40,541 --> 00:51:44,641
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you call your own
mother an old grump?</font>

799
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,541
<font color=#FFFF00>She is an old grump.</font>

800
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,341
<font color=#FFFF00>- You can't say that she's young.
- My goodness.</font>

801
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,711
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such an ungrateful person.</font>

802
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:58,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Can you fry two eggs for me?</font>

803
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:01,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. Give me a minute.</font>

804
00:52:05,971 --> 00:52:07,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I'm home.</font>

805
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:09,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Mi Joo.</font>

806
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:16,611
<font color=#FFFF00>- How have you been?
- You remember her, right?</font>

807
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:18,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

808
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,711
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been coming to our house
to cook since a week ago.</font>

809
00:52:23,111 --> 00:52:25,741
<font color=#FFFF00>You haven't seen her here
because you've been busy.</font>

810
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that so? It's good to see you again.</font>

811
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:31,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

812
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:34,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you have a seat?
I'm happy to see you, too.</font>

813
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:37,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I suppose you haven't had dinner yet.</font>

814
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:39,471
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mom.
- Yes.</font>

815
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Make dinner for Mi Joo, too.</font>

816
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:44,711
<font color=#FFFF00>You should eat with us, too.</font>

817
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:46,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

818
00:52:52,841 --> 00:52:56,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go, Mom. Eat up.</font>

819
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:57,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I am eating.</font>

820
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,141
<font color=#FFFF00>You two seem like real mother and son.</font>

821
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:02,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Really?</font>

822
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:07,671
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you. I'll take it as a compliment.</font>

823
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:12,471
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, how old are you now?</font>

824
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:14,441
<font color=#FFFF00>My gosh, Mom.</font>

825
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:17,741
<font color=#FFFF00>She's around the same age as Hyun Jeong.</font>

826
00:53:23,141 --> 00:53:26,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Your face turned all pale again.</font>

827
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:28,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Jeong?</font>

828
00:53:28,841 --> 00:53:30,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is Hyun Jeong?</font>

829
00:53:32,641 --> 00:53:33,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, you mean...</font>

830
00:53:34,841 --> 00:53:36,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Excuse me.</font>

831
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:44,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director.</font>

832
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,847
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi finished the script, but
Dong Hui hasn't finished it yet.</font>

833
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:50,411
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm going to urge her
to finish it tomorrow.</font>

834
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:54,321
<font color=#FFFF00>If she can't finish it on time,
we'll go with Writer Choi's script.</font>

835
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,241
<font color=#FFFF00>How could Writer Choi
finish writing so fast?</font>

836
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:02,511
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not important. You should hurry up.</font>

837
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,741
<font color=#FFFF00>This is so unfair to me.</font>

838
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you know that from the beginning?</font>

839
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:09,971
<font color=#FFFF00>- This is so upsetting.
- You're talking too much.</font>

840
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:13,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I am still way cuter than Writer Choi.</font>

841
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:16,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Does that make you feel better?</font>

842
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,570
<font color=#FFFF00>You're a writer. You don't need to be cute.</font>

843
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:22,841
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I'm just saying anything
because I'm too stressed out.</font>

844
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:26,111
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness. Here. Eat this.</font>

845
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:31,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Jun Sung and Yeon Hee just met.</font>

846
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:35,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Try to develop the story fast.
Have them meet Woo Hyeon, too.</font>

847
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:39,241
<font color=#FFFF00>All right. By the way, it's about Mr.
Lee across the street.</font>

848
00:54:39,341 --> 00:54:40,770
<font color=#FFFF00>He's unbelievable.</font>

849
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:44,087
<font color=#FFFF00>We've been acquainted, and we all
had a Christmas party together.</font>

850
00:54:44,111 --> 00:54:46,340
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he pretend not to know us...</font>

851
00:54:46,341 --> 00:54:49,041
<font color=#FFFF00>and push us to include a secret
behind the character's birth?</font>

852
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:51,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I actually don't like him very much.</font>

853
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,941
<font color=#FFFF00>I would punch him if he
wasn't our investor.</font>

854
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,141
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, he's a moron and a jerk.</font>

855
00:54:59,841 --> 00:55:01,947
<font color=#FFFF00>Focus on the writing.
You're talking too much.</font>

856
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:05,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I feel like my heart
will burst with stress.</font>

857
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:07,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I understand why
writers smoke cigarettes.</font>

858
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,341
<font color=#FFFF00>- What did you just say?
- You startled me.</font>

859
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you yelling?</font>

860
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,440
<font color=#FFFF00>If you start smoking and drinking...</font>

861
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:18,511
<font color=#FFFF00>thinking that's what writers do,
I won't just watch you do that.</font>

862
00:55:18,971 --> 00:55:20,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine.</font>

863
00:55:22,311 --> 00:55:24,241
<font color=#FFFF00>Here. Eat some more.</font>

864
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:30,241
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

865
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:34,041
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

866
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:38,741
<font color=#FFFF00>No. I can eat by myself.
You don't have to feed me.</font>

867
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:42,141
<font color=#FFFF00>- I wasn't aware.
- Gosh.</font>

868
00:55:42,341 --> 00:55:44,741
<font color=#FFFF00>You've been just fine with
eating the food I feed you.</font>

869
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:46,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Whatever.</font>

870
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:01,341
<font color=#FFFF00>Hi, Dad.</font>

871
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:08,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

872
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:11,441
<font color=#FFFF00>You're here. Have a seat.</font>

873
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:14,841
<font color=#FFFF00>- Have a drink.
- Okay.</font>

874
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:17,341
<font color=#FFFF00>- Can I have one more glass?
- Sure.</font>

875
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:32,711
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just that...</font>

876
00:56:34,441 --> 00:56:37,087
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't think I gave you an answer...</font>

877
00:56:37,111 --> 00:56:39,041
<font color=#FFFF00>to your question the other day.</font>

878
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:46,211
<font color=#FFFF00>More than anything,</font>

879
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:49,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just so grateful to you.</font>

880
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:56,571
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really grateful that you've
grown into a decent person.</font>

881
00:57:03,411 --> 00:57:05,871
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just an ordinary man.</font>

882
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:10,211
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm not successful or famous.</font>

883
00:57:10,771 --> 00:57:13,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't make a lot of money
like other people, either.</font>

884
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:18,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I worked at a company, and
raised you guys my whole life.</font>

885
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:22,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

886
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry that I haven't
been a better father to you.</font>

887
00:57:27,511 --> 00:57:29,241
<font color=#FFFF00>No, Dad.</font>

888
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,211
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's not what I meant. I just...
- I know.</font>

889
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:36,041
<font color=#FFFF00>I know what you want to know,</font>

890
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,971
<font color=#FFFF00>and what frustrates you.</font>

891
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:42,441
<font color=#FFFF00>But Seong Joon.</font>

892
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,541
<font color=#FFFF00>You said you love me very much, right?</font>

893
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:53,041
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes.
- I do, too.</font>

894
00:57:54,711 --> 00:57:57,111
<font color=#FFFF00>I love you very much, too.</font>

895
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,941
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I'm asking you this.</font>

896
00:58:04,341 --> 00:58:06,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we just live the way we do now?</font>

897
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:12,241
<font color=#FFFF00>I've never thought you weren't my true son.</font>

898
00:58:14,041 --> 00:58:15,111
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

899
00:58:15,841 --> 00:58:17,841
<font color=#FFFF00>You keep asking questions,</font>

900
00:58:18,741 --> 00:58:20,741
<font color=#FFFF00>and it feels like you're not my son.</font>

901
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:23,511
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes me so lonely and sad.</font>

902
00:59:17,371 --> 00:59:18,387
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello?</font>

903
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:20,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon. It's me.</font>

904
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:22,311
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

905
00:59:22,641 --> 00:59:25,670
<font color=#FFFF00>It was so good to see you, so I'm
calling you for the last time...</font>

906
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:27,341
<font color=#FFFF00>before I leave.</font>

907
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:32,241
<font color=#FFFF00>There is something I want to tell you.</font>

908
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:33,811
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that?</font>

909
00:59:34,441 --> 00:59:35,871
<font color=#FFFF00>You have an older brother.</font>

910
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:38,841
<font color=#FFFF00>- What?
- You have an older brother.</font>

911
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:40,940
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you already have a father,</font>

912
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:43,471
<font color=#FFFF00>but you should look for
your brother and be happy.</font>

913
00:59:44,771 --> 00:59:47,341
<font color=#FFFF00>The bus is here. Goodbye, then.</font>

914
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:50,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello? Hello?</font>

915
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:10,941
<font color=#FFFF00>Look who it is.</font>

916
01:00:13,541 --> 01:00:16,140
<font color=#FFFF00>- Hello. It's me, Jeong Eun.
- Yes.</font>

917
01:00:16,141 --> 01:00:18,871
<font color=#FFFF00>You're Jeong Eun, the tomboy.</font>

918
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:21,811
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sir.
- Gosh, yes.</font>

919
01:00:22,171 --> 01:00:24,447
<font color=#FFFF00>- I missed you a lot.
- All right.</font>

920
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:25,641
<font color=#FFFF00>You rascal.</font>

921
01:00:29,441 --> 01:00:32,311
<font color=#FFFF00>How is Jeong Hwa? I heard she got
married and lives in the States now.</font>

922
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:35,540
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop asking me about Jeong Hwa.</font>

923
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone in this school asks me about her.</font>

924
01:00:38,741 --> 01:00:40,540
<font color=#FFFF00>She was such a pretty girl.</font>

925
01:00:40,541 --> 01:00:42,571
<font color=#FFFF00>She was a brilliant student, too.</font>

926
01:00:44,611 --> 01:00:47,041
<font color=#FFFF00>This filthy world only
remembers the first place.</font>

927
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,311
<font color=#FFFF00>You brat.</font>

928
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:52,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Luckily, it's spring vacation now.
There is no one in school.</font>

929
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:01,271
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

930
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,181
<font color=#FFFF00>why do you want to see the yearbook?</font>

931
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:06,141
<font color=#FFFF00>There is a friend I want to find.</font>

932
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,087
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see.</font>

933
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:11,841
<font color=#FFFF00>You want to see the yearbook of 1993.</font>

934
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:21,211
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see. Where is it?</font>

935
01:01:24,241 --> 01:01:25,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Here it is.</font>

936
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,011
<font color=#FFFF00>Here you go.</font>

937
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,711
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seoin Elementary School Yearbook)</font>

938
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:39,811
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's see.</font>

939
01:01:43,411 --> 01:01:46,287
<font color=#FFFF00>"Lee Hyun Woo".</font>

940
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:48,371
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Hyun Woo)</font>

941
01:01:49,211 --> 01:01:50,411
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he the one?</font>

942
01:01:55,971 --> 01:01:57,811
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Hyun Woo)</font>

943
01:01:58,041 --> 01:01:59,111
<font color=#FFFF00>There is one more.</font>

944
01:02:05,341 --> 01:02:06,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

945
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:11,271
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Hyun Woo)</font>

946
01:02:13,671 --> 01:02:14,741
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seoin Elementary School)</font>

947
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:20,211
<font color=#FFFF00>What? What's wrong?</font>

948
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:21,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

949
01:02:22,011 --> 01:02:24,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Among the graduates of this school in 1993,</font>

950
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:26,410
<font color=#FFFF00>there're 10 people named Kim Hee Young,</font>

951
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:28,141
<font color=#FFFF00>and seven people named Kim Hye Jeong.</font>

952
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:30,471
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, three people have the same
name of the person I'm looking for.</font>

953
01:02:30,571 --> 01:02:32,810
<font color=#FFFF00>Why can't people in this
country be more creative?</font>

954
01:02:32,811 --> 01:02:35,810
<font color=#FFFF00>How can their names be all the same?</font>

955
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:38,147
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me see it.</font>

956
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Who is it that you're looking for?</font>

957
01:02:43,911 --> 01:02:46,011
<font color=#FFFF00>His name is Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

958
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:48,111
<font color=#FFFF00>His father passed away.</font>

959
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:49,411
<font color=#FFFF00>His father?</font>

960
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:53,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

961
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Here he is.</font>

962
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,541
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

963
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,911
<font color=#FFFF00>He's the one.</font>

964
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,441
<font color=#FFFF00>After he took pictures for the yearbook,</font>

965
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:05,441
<font color=#FFFF00>his father died.</font>

966
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:08,041
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why he couldn't come
to pick up the yearbook.</font>

967
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:11,671
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that he was sent to an orphanage.</font>

968
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:13,010
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

969
01:03:13,011 --> 01:03:15,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. I felt so bad for him.</font>

970
01:03:15,971 --> 01:03:17,571
<font color=#FFFF00>He was smart...</font>

971
01:03:17,871 --> 01:03:19,471
<font color=#FFFF00>and kindhearted.</font>

972
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:21,271
<font color=#FFFF00>His younger brother...</font>

973
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:23,847
<font color=#FFFF00>waited for him on the playground...</font>

974
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:25,371
<font color=#FFFF00>every day.</font>

975
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:28,141
<font color=#FFFF00>I often took him to my office...</font>

976
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,111
<font color=#FFFF00>and fed him some food.</font>

977
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:33,671
<font color=#FFFF00>He was such a polite child.</font>

978
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:37,741
<font color=#FFFF00>He would make a deep bow to thank me.</font>

979
01:03:38,171 --> 01:03:40,871
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. It was such a tragedy.</font>

980
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:43,271
<font color=#FFFF00>How could something like
that happen to them?</font>

981
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:52,171
<font color=#FFFF00>(Lee Hyun Woo)</font>

982
01:03:55,271 --> 01:03:58,010
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh, you mother flower.</font>

983
01:03:58,011 --> 01:03:59,410
<font color=#FFFF00>Shut it!</font>

984
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:01,570
<font color=#FFFF00>I curse that you were born.</font>

985
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,810
<font color=#FFFF00>I hope you die in a fire pit.</font>

986
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:07,870
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'm Korean, you jerk. So what?</font>

987
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:09,570
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do about it?</font>

988
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:11,171
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

989
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:13,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey. Stay quiet.</font>

990
01:04:14,171 --> 01:04:16,111
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm talking to your dad on the phone.</font>

991
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:20,940
<font color=#FFFF00>You want a divorce?</font>

992
01:04:20,941 --> 01:04:23,740
<font color=#FFFF00>Fine. I'm divorcing you.</font>

993
01:04:23,741 --> 01:04:29,341
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want to live with a crybaby
like you anymore. You moron.</font>

994
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:42,711
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo! Hyun Woo!</font>

995
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:46,711
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to talk to you.</font>

996
01:04:48,711 --> 01:04:49,771
<font color=#FFFF00>Look.</font>

997
01:04:50,441 --> 01:04:51,741
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you...</font>

998
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:01,041
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, Jeong Eun!</font>

999
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:08,541
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Hwa.</font>

1000
01:05:37,941 --> 01:05:39,841
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1001
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:42,041
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't ask Director
Han for it, did you?</font>

1002
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,511
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

1003
01:05:43,771 --> 01:05:47,271
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen. I heard that you got
the scar on your face...</font>

1004
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:49,911
<font color=#FFFF00>from a car accident.</font>

1005
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:52,641
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui. She disappeared.</font>

1006
01:05:52,771 --> 01:05:55,017
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you found your brother, Sang Woo?</font>

1007
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,741
<font color=#FFFF00>My brother is dead.</font>

1008
01:05:58,011 --> 01:06:00,441
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you regret what you said to me before?</font>

1009
01:06:00,871 --> 01:06:03,571
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I regret it so much.</font>
