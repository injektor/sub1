00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:32,378
<font color="yellow">May I ask what this is about?</font>

6
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,948
<font color="yellow">I somehow drifted into a situation...</font>

7
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,808
<font color="yellow">where I have no place to stay.</font>

8
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:44,908

00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:55,208
<font color="yellow">but can you help me a little?</font>

12
00:00:57,548 --> 00:00:59,408
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

13
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:01,708
<font color="yellow">I'm not in a good situation, too.</font>

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,048
<font color="yellow">I am held in suspicion.</font>

15
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,408
<font color="yellow">You should hide somewhere first.</font>

16
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:10,978
<font color="yellow">After some time passes, I will contact you.</font>

17
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:12,148
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

18
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:15,948
<font color="yellow">Hello? Hello?</font>

19
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:02,648
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, I will stop at a gas station first.</font>

20
00:02:03,948 --> 00:02:05,148
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

21
00:02:19,718 --> 00:02:20,748

22
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,008
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

23
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,278
<font color="yellow">- Please charge 50 dollars' worth. - Sure.</font>

24
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,248
<font color="yellow">- Where is the toilet? - Over there, sir.</font>

25
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,408
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

26
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,008
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

27
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:35,748
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

28
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:38,508
<font color="yellow">I have to be okay.</font>

29
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:40,408
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

30
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:43,478
<font color="yellow">you hated going in-law's.</font>

31
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:47,308
<font color="yellow">When you live life, there are some things you can't control.</font>

32
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,808
<font color="yellow">And you just have to endure it.</font>

33
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:55,078
<font color="yellow">Then good days will come again.</font>

34
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,178
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

35
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,848
<font color="yellow">Sorry for making you wait.</font>

36

<font color="yellow">Look at them!</font>

42
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:50,008
<font color="yellow">Look at them sticking to their family members to survive.</font>

43
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,978
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, turn up the volume.</font>

44
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:53,048
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

45
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,378
<font color="yellow">- Grandmother. - Wait.</font>

46
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,078
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What will they do? What will the baby penguins do...</font>

47
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,008
<font color="yellow">if their parents don't come back?</font>

48
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,278
<font color="yellow">They die.</font>

49
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,608
<font color="yellow">Really? Poor things!</font>

50
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,778
<font color="yellow">I feel terribly sorry for them.</font>

51
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:15,648
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

52
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:25,578
<font color="yellow">Mother, what are you doing right now?</font>

53
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,348
<font color="yellow">Are you trying to make me upset?</font>

54
00:04:27,608 --> 00:04:31,378
<font color="yellow">Of course I am not. I am just trying to study penguins.</font>

55
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:34,648
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon saw this documentary during biology class.</font>

56
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,308
<font color="yellow">You should watch it, too. Song Joong Ki is narrating it.</font>

57
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:40,348
<font color="yellow">He even has a sweet voice.</font>

58
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:43,048
<font color="yellow">By the way, if they sell those cuties,</font>

59
00:04:43,048 --> 00:04:44,978
<font color="yellow">I do want to try raising them.</font>

60
00:04:45,148 --> 00:04:46,548
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree with me, Ji Hoon?</font>

61
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,648
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

62
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,878
<font color="yellow">Mother!</font>

63
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:50,908
<font color="yellow">What's the use of lying in your room?</font>

64
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,548
<font color="yellow">He's still going to be your son.</font>

65
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,878
<font color="yellow">Since you're already here, you should watch this.</font>

66
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:57,018
<font color="yellow">Even those parent penguins are...</font>

67
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,608
<font color="yellow">doing that to save their offspring.</font>

68
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:02,778
<font color="yellow">Even animals take care of their offspring. So how can you not?</font>

69
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,608
<font color="yellow">Now that it happened, you should just accept it.</font>

70
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:10,078
<font color="yellow">Stop it, please! This is so hard for me!</font>

71
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,148
<font color="yellow">That's that.</font>

72
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,378
<font color="yellow">- What did you do? - Pardon me?</font>

73
00:05:24,508 --> 00:05:26,808
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking a fight with Hye Joo now?</font>

74
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:30,248
<font color="yellow">When your husband came up with a ridiculous idea,</font>

75
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,148
<font color="yellow">you should have stopped him at any cost.</font>

76
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,708
<font color="yellow">What did you do the whole time?</font>

77
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,208
<font color="yellow">I couldn't stop him.</font>

78
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:41,378
<font color="yellow">Besides, you told me not to complain about whatever he does.</font>

79
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,508
<font color="yellow">You told me to obey him.</font>

80
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,048
<font color="yellow">What is it? Are you trying to laugh at me?</font>

81
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,148
<font color="yellow">No, I am not laughing at you.</font>

82
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:50,808
<font color="yellow">He looks like he's the easiest man to fool,</font>

83
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,348
<font color="yellow">but he's unbelievably stubborn.</font>

84
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:54,878
<font color="yellow">When he's into something, he never listens to other people.</font>

85
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:58,378
<font color="yellow">Yes, Seong Hoon has been like that ever since he was young.</font>

86
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:02,108
<font color="yellow">Even so, you should have stopped his plan with penguins.</font>

87
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:04,348
<font color="yellow">How was he going to raise and sell those penguins?</font>

88
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:07,208
<font color="yellow">Did that sound normal to you?</font>

89
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,808
<font color="yellow">Penguins? My goodness.</font>

90
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:12,678
<font color="yellow">Be quiet.</font>

91
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:16,748
<font color="yellow">Why isn't one of you better than the other one?</font>

92
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,248
<font color="yellow">How can you and your husband be so same?</font>

93
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,208
<font color="yellow">Maybe that's why we live together.</font>

94
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:23,648
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

95
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:25,508
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

96
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:28,878
<font color="yellow">You frustrate me. You really do.</font>

97
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,378
<font color="yellow">I feel like my life is getting shorter...</font>

98
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:33,448
<font color="yellow">when I see your family.</font>

99
00:06:33,448 --> 00:06:34,578
<font color="yellow">Do you know that?</font>

100
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,908
<font color="yellow">Gosh. My goodness.</font>

101
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:38,748
<font color="yellow">Mother! Mother!</font>

102
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:40,708
<font color="yellow">Mother! Are you all right?</font>

103
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,008
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Jeong Ae?</font>

104
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:46,508
<font color="yellow">The penguins are killing her.</font>

105
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:48,308
<font color="yellow">Mother. Mother.</font>

106
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,408
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

107
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,678
<font color="yellow">Are you okay, Mother? Mother!</font>

108
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:05,008
<font color="yellow">It's nice and clean now.</font>

109
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:21,648
<font color="yellow">She's here.</font>

110
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,108
<font color="yellow">Mother, what should I do?</font>

111
00:07:26,248 --> 00:07:28,678
<font color="yellow">Should I take you to the doctor? Or Should I call the ambulance?</font>

112
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,578
<font color="yellow">Why would you call the ambulance? Stay quiet.</font>

113
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:35,208
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Grandmother-in-law is here.</font>

114
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:38,478
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo and Hee Sook, let's go and greet her.</font>

115
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:40,148
<font color="yellow">Yes, Father.</font>

116
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:41,878
<font color="yellow">Honey, what are you doing?</font>

117
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:43,508
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

118
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,978
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

119
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:54,178
<font color="yellow">- Just go. - Please come out.</font>

120
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:57,978
<font color="yellow">Mother, are you okay?</font>

121
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,008
<font color="yellow">- Hey Joo. - Hello.</font>

122
00:08:09,078 --> 00:08:12,708
<font color="yellow">- You're here, Grandma. - Hello, Grandmother.</font>

123
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,108
<font color="yellow">I hope it wasn't a arduous journey for you.</font>

124
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:17,978
<font color="yellow">It wasn't at all.</font>

125
00:08:18,678 --> 00:08:20,048
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

126
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:24,208
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? She's already here.</font>

127
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:28,378
<font color="yellow">Mother, what am I going to do?</font>

128
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:32,678
<font color="yellow">How can I live with my kids and in-laws?</font>

129
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,948
<font color="yellow">Who told you to have a son like him?</font>

130
00:08:35,378 --> 00:08:39,648
<font color="yellow">By the way, she is a victim. She was conned by your son.</font>

131
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:42,078
<font color="yellow">Rush outside.</font>

132
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:46,008
<font color="yellow">Take care of your in-law who lost her house due to your son.</font>

133
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,308
<font color="yellow">Since we are on the subject, penguins are not like abalones.</font>

134
00:08:49,578 --> 00:08:51,778
<font color="yellow">How can one raise penguins?</font>

135
00:08:51,908 --> 00:08:54,618
<font color="yellow">If it was that easy to raise, there would have been...</font>

136
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:57,578
<font color="yellow">a crowd of people stringing penguins on the street.</font>

137
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,578
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

138
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:05,378
<font color="yellow">I did come here bearing my shame.</font>

139
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:09,118
<font color="yellow">I am so sorry and embarrassed.</font>

140
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,618
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

141
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,008
<font color="yellow">Please don't think that way.</font>

142
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:17,578
<font color="yellow">They are our children and we are all parents after all.</font>

143
00:09:17,748 --> 00:09:20,448
<font color="yellow">We need to stick together when times are hard.</font>

144
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,908
<font color="yellow">In fact, it's the opposite.</font>

145
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:26,078
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say about my son.</font>

146
00:09:26,548 --> 00:09:28,148
<font color="yellow">I'm sincerely sorry.</font>

147
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,878
<font color="yellow">Father, she is my youngest sister.</font>

148
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,078
<font color="yellow">That makes you an in-law.</font>

149
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,578
<font color="yellow">When did you grow up to be a woman?</font>

150
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,908
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

151
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:48,118
<font color="yellow">Welcome. Please feel free to say here.</font>

152
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,378
<font color="yellow">- Where is Jeong Ae? - She's coming.</font>

153
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:00,778
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you, Mrs. Oh.</font>

154
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,648
<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

155
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:07,008
<font color="yellow">I've been well, of course.</font>

156
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:12,248
<font color="yellow">Welcome, Mrs. Oh.</font>

157

00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,508
<font color="yellow">I said bow, Seong Joon.</font>

311
00:24:27,578 --> 00:24:30,948
<font color="yellow">Make a deep bow to Dong Hui politely.</font>

312
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:33,348
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

313
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:37,948
<font color="yellow">How about you, Dong Hui?</font>

314
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,848
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

315
00:24:46,048 --> 00:24:50,278
<font color="yellow">They look so great. They have both grown to fine man and woman.</font>

316
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,978
<font color="yellow">Mrs. Oh. This is my youngest grandson.</font>

317
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:55,078
<font color="yellow">Isn't he handsome?</font>

318
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:59,378
<font color="yellow">Yes. He is.</font>

319
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:05,548
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You've raised Dong Hui to a very graceful...</font>

320
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:07,608
<font color="yellow">and cute woman.</font>

321
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,448
<font color="yellow">She's nothing like you.</font>

322
00:25:09,778 --> 00:25:12,608
<font color="yellow">You have a round and flattish face and broad shoulders.</font>

323
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:15,308
<font color="yellow">You look like a man. You said you were frustrated...</font>

324
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:18,978
<font color="yellow">because you can't easily find clothes that fit you.</font>

325
00:25:21,778 --> 00:25:24,878
<font color="yellow">That's what you said to me. But your granddaughter is...</font>

326
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:26,578
<font color="yellow">so pretty. Gosh.</font>

327
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:28,778
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my. - Grandmother.</font>

328
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:31,548
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - You should eat now. Please come.</font>

329
00:25:31,548 --> 00:25:32,748
<font color="yellow">Shall we?</font>

330
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,848
<font color="yellow">What is today's dinner?</font>

331
00:25:34,978 --> 00:25:37,248
<font color="yellow">- Since my grandma is here, - Yes.</font>

332
00:25:37,478 --> 00:25:39,808
<font color="yellow">I made bulgogi and spicy marinated crab.</font>

333
00:25:39,808 --> 00:25:42,648
<font color="yellow">Really? I love spicy marinated crab.</font>

334
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:45,348
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is upsetting.</font>

335
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:48,248
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Give me food. Isn't it time for dinner?</font>

336
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:49,378
<font color="yellow">Give me food, Aunt.</font>

337
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,048
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

338
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:57,548
<font color="yellow">Why are so many people here?</font>

339
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,308
<font color="yellow">- You're back. - Jeong Eun.</font>

340
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,308
<font color="yellow">Let me see. One, two, three, four, five,</font>

341
00:26:02,308 --> 00:26:04,978
<font color="yellow">- six, seven, eight... - Don't mind her. I'll handle it.</font>

342
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,778
<font color="yellow">Hey. Follow me.</font>

343
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,908
<font color="yellow">Mom. You should just introduce her to everyone.</font>

344
00:26:09,908 --> 00:26:12,378
<font color="yellow">There's no need. She's just a pedlar. Come here.</font>

345
00:26:12,448 --> 00:26:15,208
<font color="yellow">Grandma. Did you call me a pedlar? Grandma.</font>

346
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:29,348
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it hurts!</font>

347
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,878
<font color="yellow">If your in-laws moved in, you should introduce me to them.</font>

348
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:34,848
<font color="yellow">How can you be so harsh?</font>

349
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:37,378
<font color="yellow">Forget about it and go back to your house.</font>

350
00:26:37,608 --> 00:26:41,148
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae is on edge right now because so many people moved in.</font>

351
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,678
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't walk around in front of her.</font>

352
00:26:45,508 --> 00:26:47,678
<font color="yellow">Just pack your things and go home.</font>

353
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,708
<font color="yellow">No. Mom doesn't like me.</font>

354
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,078
<font color="yellow">What about us? We don't like you, either.</font>

355
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,108
<font color="yellow">Grandma!</font>

356
00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:56,778
<font color="yellow">Look. This house is full.</font>

357
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,948
<font color="yellow">My grandsons' family and even Seong Hoon's...</font>

358
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:00,448
<font color="yellow">in-laws moved in.</font>

359
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:03,648
<font color="yellow">We have no more place for you to stay.</font>

360
00:27:03,648 --> 00:27:05,608
<font color="yellow">You won't fit, okay?</font>

361
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:08,008
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

362
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:11,248
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what you just said.</font>

363
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:36,378
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep interrupting me while I'm performing something?</font>

364
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:39,578
<font color="yellow">I don't care what you do. Just take your daughter!</font>

365
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:42,508
<font color="yellow">She has nothing to do with me. She's not my daughter.</font>

366
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:44,848
<font color="yellow">I can't believe they left me out.</font>

367
00:27:45,078 --> 00:27:48,648
<font color="yellow">Even Hye Joo's grandmother is here, and it's an utter chaos now.</font>

368
00:27:48,648 --> 00:27:52,708
<font color="yellow">- Hye Joo... - Anyway, she's not my daughter.</font>

369
00:27:52,748 --> 00:27:55,248
<font color="yellow">Please tell that wench who returned after three years...</font>

370
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:57,178
<font color="yellow">that there's no room for her here, so she has to stay there.</font>

371
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,348
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

372
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,848
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ae Ri!</font>

373
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:04,948
<font color="yellow">What? Is that really true?</font>

374
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,608
<font color="yellow">It is.</font>

375
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:09,908
<font color="yellow">When I heard about that, I thought it was a lie.</font>

376
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,148
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

377
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:14,908
<font color="yellow">I know he's so square and naive,</font>

378
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:19,478
<font color="yellow">but how could he believe that they could raise penguins here?</font>

379
00:28:19,578 --> 00:28:21,448
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

380
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:25,608
<font color="yellow">This really drives me crazy. What's gotten into his head?</font>

381
00:28:25,778 --> 00:28:29,148
<font color="yellow">- That's what. - So, is Hye Joo's grandmother...</font>

382
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:31,578
<font color="yellow">staying in this building?</font>

383
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:32,978
<font color="yellow">Yes, she is.</font>

384
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,308
<font color="yellow">My brother must have gone out of mind.</font>

385
00:28:46,148 --> 00:28:48,808
<font color="yellow">- The water is hot, right? - Yes.</font>

386
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:51,508
<font color="yellow">Are you happy?</font>

387
00:28:53,878 --> 00:28:55,308
<font color="yellow">I am.</font>

388
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:58,778
<font color="yellow">Good for you. That's enough.</font>

389
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:02,448
<font color="yellow">Come and sleep.</font>

390
00:29:03,178 --> 00:29:04,248
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

391
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:40,378
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi.</font>

392
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,448
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

393
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:53,248
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

394
00:30:55,108 --> 00:30:56,748
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

395
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:59,878
<font color="yellow">Is it a Taiwanese version or a Korean version?</font>

396
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:03,708
<font color="yellow">Let's go for the Taiwanese one first.</font>

397
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,748
<font color="yellow">Did you return home safely that day?</font>

398
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:08,348
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

399
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:10,848
<font color="yellow">Did anything happen on your way?</font>

400
00:31:12,378 --> 00:31:14,808
<font color="yellow">Not at all, thanks to you.</font>

401
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:16,208
<font color="yellow">What happened to your brother?</font>

402
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,648
<font color="yellow">- I don't know. - I knew you wouldn't.</font>

403
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:28,348
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you, anyway.</font>

404
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:31,448
<font color="yellow">Why are you glad to meet?</font>

405
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,378
<font color="yellow">It's a Korean version.</font>

406
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:38,348
<font color="yellow">I never knew you'd be Seong Hoon's brother.</font>

407
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:41,808
<font color="yellow">Me either. I never thought we'd be related in this way.</font>

408
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:47,378
<font color="yellow">If we had knew, we would have bowed to each other in Taiwan.</font>

409
00:31:54,548 --> 00:31:57,478
<font color="yellow">Anyway, welcome to our house.</font>

410
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:01,308
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll feel comfortable here. Goodnight, then.</font>

411
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:06,178
<font color="yellow">Right. Thank you for returning my backpack.</font>

412
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:08,908
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

413
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:14,548
<font color="yellow">Please wait a minute. I have something to tell you...</font>

414
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:49,748
<font color="yellow">I don't want to brush my teeth</font>

415
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:52,678
<font color="yellow">I don't want to wash my face</font>

416
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:55,378
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to take the sleep out of my eyes</font>

417
00:32:55,378 --> 00:32:57,378
<font color="yellow">I won't take a shower</font>

418
00:32:58,248 --> 00:33:00,378
<font color="yellow">Let me secretly</font>

419
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,948
<font color="yellow">tell you my secret</font>

420
00:33:03,378 --> 00:33:06,878
<font color="yellow">I didn't take a shower yesterday either</font>

421
00:33:07,048 --> 00:33:09,478
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

422
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,178
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

423
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:17,248
<font color="yellow">I rather spend the time singing</font>

424
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:19,708
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

425
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:22,378
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

426
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:25,378
<font color="yellow">I can sing all day long</font>

427
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,108
<font color="yellow">And it's still not enough</font>

428
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:30,448
<font color="yellow">I don't want to brush my teeth</font>

429
00:33:30,848 --> 00:33:33,008
<font color="yellow">- I don't want to wash my face - Hello.</font>

430
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,748
<font color="yellow">Hello. I heard you are the new in-law who moved in yesterday.</font>

431
00:33:42,078 --> 00:33:45,378
<font color="yellow">- I hope we can get along well. - It's nice to meet you.</font>

432
00:33:46,578 --> 00:33:50,178
<font color="yellow">There's no room for me to stay here because of you,</font>

433
00:33:50,178 --> 00:33:52,948
<font color="yellow">but please don't get scared when I dart in and out of places.</font>

434
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,378
<font color="yellow">Also, do not tell my grandma on me.</font>

435
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:57,108
<font color="yellow">Let's get along and help each other out, okay?</font>

436
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,878
<font color="yellow">I'm Han Jeong Eun. I'm 30 years old.</font>

437
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,248
<font color="yellow">My grandma calls me a spinster,</font>

438
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,148
<font color="yellow">but I'm still young at heart. What about you?</font>

439
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:09,048
<font color="yellow">I'm Oh Dong Hui. I'm a 26-year-old girl.</font>

440
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:13,108
<font color="yellow">Girl? That's really a cute way of introducing oneself.</font>

441
00:34:15,248 --> 00:34:17,718
<font color="yellow">- How cute. - Thank you.</font>

442
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:19,848
<font color="yellow">Anyway, where are you going at this early hour?</font>

443
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:21,948
<font color="yellow">I have a part time job.</font>

444
00:34:22,608 --> 00:34:24,978
<font color="yellow">I also need money. Should follow you there?</font>

445
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,878
<font color="yellow">Well. It's my first day, too.</font>

446
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:30,248
<font color="yellow">Then, please tell me...</font>

447
00:34:30,278 --> 00:34:33,848
<font color="yellow">if they pay you a lot and assign an easy task, okay?</font>

448
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:36,008
<font color="yellow">Okay, I will.</font>

449
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,748
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Dong Hui.</font>

450
00:34:38,718 --> 00:34:39,808
<font color="yellow">See you.</font>

451
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:44,478
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

452
00:34:48,608 --> 00:34:50,718
<font color="yellow">I don't want to brush my teeth</font>

453
00:34:52,078 --> 00:34:54,378
<font color="yellow">I don't want to brush my teeth</font>

454
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,178
<font color="yellow">I don't want to wash my face</font>

455
00:34:58,248 --> 00:35:00,108
<font color="yellow">I don't even want to take the sleep out of my eyes</font>

456
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:07,178
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I'm here. I guess Dong Hui went out.</font>

457
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,648
<font color="yellow">That's right. She left early in the morning.</font>

458
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:13,148
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

459
00:35:13,308 --> 00:35:16,218
<font color="yellow">To ask you if you slept well last night. Wasn't it cold in here?</font>

460
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:20,048
<font color="yellow">- Go downstairs now. - Why?</font>

461
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:22,778
<font color="yellow">Your parents-in-law won't like this.</font>

462
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:25,248
<font color="yellow">We can take care of ourselves,</font>

463
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:28,448
<font color="yellow">- so don't come up here. - Still...</font>

464
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:30,348
<font color="yellow">I said go downstairs.</font>

465
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:36,948
<font color="yellow">- Father. - What is it?</font>

466
00:35:38,248 --> 00:35:39,848
<font color="yellow">How is Mother now?</font>

467
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,308
<font color="yellow">Just leave. Go now.</font>

468
00:35:43,378 --> 00:35:45,148
<font color="yellow">What's wrong, Father?</font>

469
00:35:46,548 --> 00:35:47,808
<font color="yellow">Just go out.</font>

470
00:35:53,808 --> 00:35:55,608
<font color="yellow">All your energies are...</font>

471
00:35:56,048 --> 00:35:57,548
<font color="yellow">focused on inside your body and mind.</font>

472
00:35:58,508 --> 00:35:59,848
<font color="yellow">Now you have...</font>

473
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,578
<font color="yellow">delta brainwaves.</font>

474
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:06,578
<font color="yellow">You'll now hand over the control over your life...</font>

475
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,748
<font color="yellow">to yourself.</font>

476
00:36:09,648 --> 00:36:11,178
<font color="yellow">I admit...</font>

477
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:14,378
<font color="yellow">that there's nothing wrong in my life.</font>

478
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:17,718
<font color="yellow">I love myself.</font>

479
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:22,008
<font color="yellow">Therefore, I sincerely love my life.</font>

480
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:51,218
<font color="yellow">He gives me a headache.</font>

481
00:37:01,578 --> 00:37:03,378
<font color="yellow">The morning hours are the most important.</font>

482
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,508
<font color="yellow">If you feel sleepy, eat the medicine I gave you and drink some coffee.</font>

483
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:11,008
<font color="yellow">- I will. - You have a gym class today, right?</font>

484
00:37:11,278 --> 00:37:12,848
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - Do not run.</font>

485
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,108
<font color="yellow">Or you'll get too tired to concentrate in the afternoon.</font>

486
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:18,478
<font color="yellow">Tell the teacher that you sprained your leg and read books, okay?</font>

487
00:37:19,248 --> 00:37:20,278
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

488
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:22,278
<font color="yellow">You can go now.</font>

489
00:37:24,948 --> 00:37:27,178
<font color="yellow">How can you not even say bye to your mom?</font>

490
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:33,648
<font color="yellow">I will pick you up at night. Meet me where I always wait for you.</font>

491
00:37:33,648 --> 00:37:34,718
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

492
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:50,178
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hey.</font>

493
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,748
<font color="yellow">- Aunt. - Aren't you going to school?</font>

494
00:37:55,078 --> 00:37:56,248
<font color="yellow">Are we already at the school?</font>

495
00:37:57,548 --> 00:37:59,308
<font color="yellow">"Are we already at the school?"</font>

496
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,718
<font color="yellow">We got here a long time ago!</font>

497
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,108
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

498
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:13,448
<font color="yellow">I will go in now. Bye, Aunt.</font>

499
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:15,978
<font color="yellow">Why do you say bye to me?</font>

500
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:17,448
<font color="yellow">Am I your mom?</font>

501
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:22,008
<font color="yellow">What on earth does your mom do every morning?</font>

502
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,778
<font color="yellow">She doesn't fix breakfast and she doesn't give you a ride, too.</font>

503
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:26,508
<font color="yellow">I am not sure.</font>

504
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:28,778
<font color="yellow">My mom is always busy.</font>

505
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:30,948
<font color="yellow">She's rarely cooked us breakfast.</font>

506
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:34,578
<font color="yellow">I will see you at home later in the evening.</font>

507
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:37,218
<font color="yellow">Thank you for breakfast this morning!</font>

508
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:39,548
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

509
00:38:39,548 --> 00:38:42,078
<font color="yellow">Both the mother and the child are so thick-faced.</font>

510
00:38:42,448 --> 00:38:43,508
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

511
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:45,048
<font color="yellow">Are you Chang Soo's mother?</font>

512
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:47,578
<font color="yellow">- Pardon me? - You are, aren't you?</font>

513
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:50,148
<font color="yellow">No, I am not Chang Soo's mother.</font>

514
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:52,508
<font color="yellow">You are Chang Soo's mother. Why are you hiding it?</font>

515
00:38:52,548 --> 00:38:55,948
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? I am not Chang Soo's mother!</font>

516
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:59,278
<font color="yellow">Stop lying! I saw him saying bye to you! How dare you lie?</font>

517
00:38:59,278 --> 00:39:01,548
<font color="yellow">I am going to settle things regarding Chang Soo.</font>

518
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,678
<font color="yellow">Look! By yesterday, Chang Soo had...</font>

519
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:06,248
<font color="yellow">356.75-dollar worth of bread.</font>

520
00:39:06,248 --> 00:39:07,478
<font color="yellow">Settle this amount, Mrs. Han.</font>

521
00:39:08,378 --> 00:39:10,248
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and pay me!</font>

522
00:39:13,308 --> 00:39:14,448
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

523
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,978
<font color="yellow">Daddy will take you to the preschool today.</font>

524
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:21,178
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - You're a good girl.</font>

525
00:39:23,218 --> 00:39:26,948
<font color="yellow">I am so happy that you're home, Dad.</font>

526
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,278
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Yes.</font>

527
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:31,378
<font color="yellow">- Should I stay home all the time? - Yes.</font>

528
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,578
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

529
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,308
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

530
00:39:40,748 --> 00:39:41,848
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

531
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,478
<font color="yellow">Ah In, go down and get your backpack.</font>

532
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:48,378
<font color="yellow">- Please bring daddy a shirt, too. - Okay.</font>

533
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:56,508
<font color="yellow">Are you going to work now?</font>

534
00:39:57,218 --> 00:39:58,378
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

535
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,278
<font color="yellow">Well. Have a nice day.</font>

536
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,778
<font color="yellow">By the way.</font>

537
00:40:04,548 --> 00:40:06,218
<font color="yellow">- What? - Seong Hoon.</font>

538
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,378
<font color="yellow">Why do you dress like that?</font>

539
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,378
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

540
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,908
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with it? I'm at home.</font>

541
00:40:19,578 --> 00:40:20,578
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

542
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,248
<font color="yellow">Is that something to be proud of?</font>

543
00:40:23,718 --> 00:40:25,378
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - I've been wanting to...</font>

544
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:28,678
<font color="yellow">say this since last night, but I've been stopping myself.</font>

545
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:31,108
<font color="yellow">You should not have left your job.</font>

546
00:40:31,108 --> 00:40:33,548
<font color="yellow">Why did you start a business and get your in-laws bankrupt?</font>

547
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,178
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to make your grandmother-in-law come here?</font>

548
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:38,748
<font color="yellow">- Seong Sik. - Don't you...</font>

549
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:40,308
<font color="yellow">feel bad for mom?</font>

550
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:43,148
<font color="yellow">Mom is making a huge fuss and getting all stressed out...</font>

551
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,748
<font color="yellow">because we all moved in.</font>

552
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:48,608
<font color="yellow">How can you bring your grandmother-in-law here?</font>

553
00:40:48,848 --> 00:40:51,108
<font color="yellow">We literally live below each other.</font>

554
00:40:51,178 --> 00:40:53,718
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother-in-law is at the very top. Then there's granny.</font>

555
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:55,778
<font color="yellow">Below her is me, and below us is you and your family!</font>

556
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:58,378
<font color="yellow">Mom is not a layered cake.</font>

557
00:40:58,378 --> 00:41:00,218
<font color="yellow">How torturing would it be for her?</font>

558
00:41:00,508 --> 00:41:02,608
<font color="yellow">And now we have mentioned it. So let me tell you this.</font>

559
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:05,308
<font color="yellow">Not everybody can run a business.</font>

560
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:07,948
<font color="yellow">You're not meant to be a business man.</font>

561
00:41:08,348 --> 00:41:11,378
<font color="yellow">You should have been thankful for your payment and stick to your job.</font>

562
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:12,848
<font color="yellow">You can't possibly run a business.</font>

563
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:15,348
<font color="yellow">What? What did you just say?</font>

564
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:17,108
<font color="yellow">Be thankful for your payment and stick to your job?</font>

565
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:18,808
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

566
00:41:19,848 --> 00:41:21,778
<font color="yellow">Go hiking with me.</font>

567
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:27,008
<font color="yellow">I will go and buy you what you like. So come with me, please?</font>

568
00:41:28,508 --> 00:41:31,078
<font color="yellow">Staying home will just stress you out even more.</font>

569
00:41:31,478 --> 00:41:35,308
<font color="yellow">Your first son got into a car accident on the way to work.</font>

570
00:41:35,748 --> 00:41:37,808
<font color="yellow">We need money to operate on him.</font>

571
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:39,218
<font color="yellow">My son...</font>

572
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:42,148
<font color="yellow">is out of work.</font>

573
00:41:42,448 --> 00:41:44,808
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we need money to operate on him.</font>

574
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:46,048
<font color="yellow">My son...</font>

575
00:41:47,148 --> 00:41:48,808
<font color="yellow">is home right now.</font>

576
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,248
<font color="yellow">Yes, you idiot.</font>

577
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:53,178
<font color="yellow">I got tired of my tiny wage,</font>

578
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:56,248
<font color="yellow">so I wanted to run a business. After that,</font>

579
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:59,248
<font color="yellow">I wanted to earn a lot of money and make my family happy.</font>

580
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:02,748
<font color="yellow">Also, I wanted to be a good son. What's wrong with this?</font>

581
00:42:02,908 --> 00:42:05,108
<font color="yellow">That is the problem.</font>

582
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:07,678
<font color="yellow">The men in their 40s get so excited by the idea of running a business.</font>

583
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:11,448
<font color="yellow">But they end up destroying everything including their family.</font>

584
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:14,718
<font color="yellow">Do you think nobody is asking me to start a business?</font>

585
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:17,308
<font color="yellow">They said that my status as a lawyer and...</font>

586
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:20,808
<font color="yellow">a political commentator are good enough for a business.</font>

587
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:23,448
<font color="yellow">Someone even asked me to start an entertainment agency.</font>

588
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:26,608
<font color="yellow">And another person said he would start a management firm just for me.</font>

589
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:29,578
<font color="yellow">Do you know how many offers I got?</font>

590
00:42:30,078 --> 00:42:32,178
<font color="yellow">But I refused everything on the spot. Why?</font>

591
00:42:32,678 --> 00:42:34,808
<font color="yellow">I refused because a silkworm needs to eat only mulberry leaves.</font>

592
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:38,908
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, this is just unbelievable.</font>

593
00:42:39,078 --> 00:42:41,948
<font color="yellow">How can you bring your in-law here?</font>

594
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:45,348
<font color="yellow">- How can you be so shameless? - What? Shameless?</font>

595
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,178
<font color="yellow">Are you done?</font>

596
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:51,218
<font color="yellow">- How dare you say that to me? - Daddy.</font>

597
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,378
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Let's stop.</font>

598
00:42:58,378 --> 00:42:59,678
<font color="yellow">Let's talk later.</font>

599
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,848
<font color="yellow">Let's go, Ah In.</font>

600
00:43:02,048 --> 00:43:04,448
<font color="yellow">Bye. Don't be so emotional.</font>

601
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,508
<font color="yellow">Try to be rational. Seong Hoon!</font>

602
00:43:06,778 --> 00:43:09,948
<font color="yellow">And what are you doing in the middle of our place?</font>

603
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:12,548
<font color="yellow">Do something about your chest!</font>

604
00:43:13,348 --> 00:43:14,848
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

605
00:43:15,218 --> 00:43:17,108
<font color="yellow">Oh my goodness.</font>

606
00:43:23,678 --> 00:43:25,978
<font color="yellow">That's it. Smile a little brighter. One, two!</font>

607
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,978
<font color="yellow">That's it. One, two.</font>

608
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:30,078
<font color="yellow">Stand together.</font>

609
00:43:30,478 --> 00:43:32,308
<font color="yellow">That's it. Here we go. One, two.</font>

610
00:43:32,308 --> 00:43:34,508
<font color="yellow">That's it. Can you go behind her and hug her?</font>

611
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,078
<font color="yellow">- That expression is good. One, two. - Wait!</font>

612
00:43:39,548 --> 00:43:42,648
<font color="yellow">- Let's take some break! - Let's take a break.</font>

613
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:47,948
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? It was going well.</font>

614
00:43:47,948 --> 00:43:49,348
<font color="yellow">It was going well?</font>

615
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,848
<font color="yellow">You're shooting a film!</font>

616
00:43:51,878 --> 00:43:53,578
<font color="yellow">I told you to come up with a storyboard for a commercial,</font>

617
00:43:53,608 --> 00:43:55,708
<font color="yellow">and you came up with an art.</font>

618
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,948
<font color="yellow">- It's useless! - What are you doing right now?</font>

619
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,148
<font color="yellow">I came here to help because you asked for cooperation.</font>

620
00:44:01,148 --> 00:44:03,608
<font color="yellow">You should be help then.</font>

621
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,548
<font color="yellow">What is this? You all read it, right?</font>

622
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:07,348
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

623
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:10,378
<font color="yellow">"A man and a woman run into each other during night hiking."</font>

624
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:13,748
<font color="yellow">"What will happen to them? Will they fall in love?"</font>

625
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:16,548
<font color="yellow">I told you to sell the product, not to write a TV drama!</font>

626
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:18,078
<font color="yellow">Is it a horror story?</font>

627
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,378
<font color="yellow">It's scary to run into people when you're up the mountain.</font>

628
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:22,078
<font color="yellow">They'd never fall in love!</font>

629
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:25,108
<font color="yellow">What? A horror story?</font>

630
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:29,648
<font color="yellow">You said even a commercial needs a story and...</font>

631
00:44:29,648 --> 00:44:33,048
<font color="yellow">asked the marketing team and the contents team for cooperation.</font>

632
00:44:33,178 --> 00:44:36,108
<font color="yellow">That's why we've been working all night until now even it's not ours.</font>

633
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:39,278
<font color="yellow">I even brought our writer. You should be thankful to us.</font>

634
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:42,248
<font color="yellow">We're busy working on the next drama series.</font>

635
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:44,778
<font color="yellow">This is why every drama you make fails.</font>

636
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:47,248
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Mr. Park!</font>

637
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:48,448
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

638
00:44:50,308 --> 00:44:51,378
<font color="yellow">You're here.</font>

639
00:44:51,748 --> 00:44:55,878
<font color="yellow">He's making a huge fuss because he doesn't like our storyboard.</font>

640
00:44:55,908 --> 00:44:59,278
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park, I heard you prepared this for three months.</font>

641
00:44:59,478 --> 00:45:01,478
<font color="yellow">The final confirmation was done a month ago.</font>

642
00:45:01,878 --> 00:45:04,948
<font color="yellow">It's not something you can quit simply because you don't like it.</font>

643
00:45:04,948 --> 00:45:08,448
<font color="yellow">He should think about how to sell the products.</font>

644
00:45:08,448 --> 00:45:10,578
<font color="yellow">He keeps approaching it as if it was a drama series.</font>

645
00:45:10,578 --> 00:45:13,108
<font color="yellow">Then don't order me around.</font>

646
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,248
<font color="yellow">Is the Contents Team the secretary of the Marketing Team?</font>

647
00:45:15,308 --> 00:45:16,978
<font color="yellow">You always make us work for you!</font>

648
00:45:16,978 --> 00:45:19,378
<font color="yellow">Then you shouldn't waste all the money we make!</font>

649
00:45:19,378 --> 00:45:23,208
<font color="yellow">When we earn money, you waste them on dramas.</font>

650
00:45:24,048 --> 00:45:26,948
<font color="yellow">You're like a parasite feeding upon human.</font>

651
00:45:27,778 --> 00:45:29,848
<font color="yellow">What? A parasite?</font>

652
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,148
<font color="yellow">The nuclear reactor is exploding today!</font>

653
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:34,908
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park.</font>

654
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:38,178
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

655
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:40,208
<font color="yellow">You're here, ma'am.</font>

656
00:45:40,308 --> 00:45:41,648
<font color="yellow">Why are you arguing?</font>

657
00:45:41,648 --> 00:45:45,078
<font color="yellow">We're shooting a commercial, and the drama team isn't helping.</font>

658
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:47,008
<font color="yellow">So I was scolding them.</font>

659
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:50,048
<font color="yellow">I don't think it's up to the Marketing Team leader...</font>

660
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:53,178
<font color="yellow">to discuss whether or not if they help our company.</font>

661
00:45:53,508 --> 00:45:56,708
<font color="yellow">I wasn't discussing it.</font>

662
00:45:57,178 --> 00:46:00,608
<font color="yellow">We work so hard to earn money,</font>

663
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:03,378
<font color="yellow">and they always spend money saying they are doing some arts.</font>

664
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:05,878
<font color="yellow">It happens to the latest drama series, too.</font>

665
00:46:06,048 --> 00:46:08,748
<font color="yellow">They got tricked by a coordinator in Shanghai...</font>

666
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:10,608
<font color="yellow">and lost 200,000 dollars, didn't they?</font>

667
00:46:10,608 --> 00:46:13,448
<font color="yellow">So I was trying to talk around and...</font>

668
00:46:13,448 --> 00:46:15,108
<font color="yellow">address it symbolically.</font>

669
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:17,548
<font color="yellow">From the start, that business was considered as an investment.</font>

670
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:20,678
<font color="yellow">Please be more patient for the Contents Team, Mr. Park.</font>

671
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:23,608
<font color="yellow">Of course. I will.</font>

672
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,708
<font color="yellow">I will wait.</font>

673
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:30,208
<font color="yellow">Can't you be friendly to each other now?</font>

674
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:35,248
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park, the team leader of Marketing Team...</font>

675
00:46:35,478 --> 00:46:38,608
<font color="yellow">must stop being so annoying like his name.</font>

676
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:39,908
<font color="yellow">He might hear us.</font>

677
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:43,048
<font color="yellow">Conflict exists in any organization.</font>

678
00:46:43,348 --> 00:46:45,608
<font color="yellow">You should solve the conflict wisely.</font>

679
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:48,608
<font color="yellow">How can you fight every time you meet?</font>

680
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:52,278
<font color="yellow">He always talks about money whenever he sees us.</font>

681
00:46:52,508 --> 00:46:55,978
<font color="yellow">People must think he's the director of Contents Marking Team.</font>

682
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:59,008
<font color="yellow">He's using his age and experience...</font>

683
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:00,908
<font color="yellow">to look down on our team.</font>

684
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:03,308
<font color="yellow">He's right. He's so annoying.</font>

685
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:04,448
<font color="yellow">Let's stop.</font>

686
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:07,808
<font color="yellow">Like what Ms. Bang said, conflict exists in any organization.</font>

687
00:47:07,948 --> 00:47:10,148
<font color="yellow">But it should arise for the growth of the organization.</font>

688
00:47:10,248 --> 00:47:12,748
<font color="yellow">Let's not get your emotions involved.</font>

689
00:47:13,278 --> 00:47:15,878
<font color="yellow">That's why he should fix his personality.</font>

690
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:17,448
<font color="yellow">Or he should change his name.</font>

691
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,948
<font color="yellow">Right, Director Han, you said you didn't get to meet...</font>

692
00:47:22,948 --> 00:47:24,548
<font color="yellow">the sister of Seo Cheol Min again, right?</font>

693
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,448
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

694
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,078
<font color="yellow">Seo Cheol Min's younger sibling was a sister?</font>

695
00:47:30,478 --> 00:47:33,108
<font color="yellow">Yes. Didn't you know?</font>

696
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,378
<font color="yellow">Then you have his grandmother's phone number, right?</font>

697
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:40,848
<font color="yellow">Let me have it, please. I'll call her and catch her.</font>

698
00:47:41,378 --> 00:47:45,348
<font color="yellow">That's how no one can pick on you for spending company's money.</font>

699
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:46,678
<font color="yellow">Please give it to me.</font>

700
00:47:47,808 --> 00:47:49,008
<font color="yellow">I don't have it.</font>

701
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:51,778
<font color="yellow">I lost all of my contacts in my phone.</font>

702
00:47:53,108 --> 00:47:54,478
<font color="yellow">Director Han.</font>

703
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:58,078
<font color="yellow">How? How did that happen?</font>

704
00:47:59,248 --> 00:48:02,848
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do now. I think I'm going crazy.</font>

705
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,978
<font color="yellow">Isn't he home? Why isn't he answering?</font>

706
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:31,548
<font color="yellow">I have to find my toiletries today.</font>

707
00:48:47,278 --> 00:48:48,378
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun</font>

708
00:48:50,878 --> 00:48:51,908
<font color="yellow">Detective.</font>

709
00:48:53,378 --> 00:48:56,108
<font color="yellow">I missed you.</font>

710
00:48:56,108 --> 00:48:58,208
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

711
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,448
<font color="yellow">When did you come back?</font>

712
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:04,008
<font color="yellow">I came back a few days ago. Isn't that good?</font>

713
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,178
<font color="yellow">Yes, It is.</font>

714
00:49:06,078 --> 00:49:09,308
<font color="yellow">It's been so long.</font>

715
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:12,778
<font color="yellow">I know. Since I haven't seen you for so long,</font>

716
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:14,678
<font color="yellow">do you want to have lunch with me?</font>

717
00:49:20,178 --> 00:49:24,108
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, isn't it nice to ride the car without being drunk?</font>

718
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:25,578
<font color="yellow">Yes, it is.</font>

719
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:28,708
<font color="yellow">Detective, where are we going?</font>

720
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:31,848
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

721
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,308
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

722
00:49:34,448 --> 00:49:37,648
<font color="yellow">Eat it and cooperate with us.</font>

723
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,848
<font color="yellow">You really caught her, sir.</font>

724
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:44,148
<font color="yellow">How can you not recognize Jeong Eun?</font>

725
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,908
<font color="yellow">- Detective. - Okay.</font>

726
00:49:46,508 --> 00:49:48,108
<font color="yellow">The soup's getting cold.</font>

727
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:50,878
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

728
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:56,078
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

729
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:57,448
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

730
00:49:58,378 --> 00:50:00,708
<font color="yellow">you reported me, right?</font>

731
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:03,848
<font color="yellow">Is this how you treat me because I slept in your construction site?</font>

732
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:06,808
<font color="yellow">Besides, I didn't even sleep there. You kicked me out.</font>

733
00:50:07,778 --> 00:50:09,548
<font color="yellow">You just didn't sleep there.</font>

734
00:50:10,578 --> 00:50:11,648
<font color="yellow">Did you forget already?</font>

735
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:13,878
<font color="yellow">My forehead.</font>

736
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:16,348
<font color="yellow">The wound won't be healed for four weeks.</font>

737
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:20,008
<font color="yellow">Do you want to cooperate or settle this?</font>

738
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:23,048
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I have no money.</font>

739
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:27,048
<font color="yellow">Besides, why do you keep coming back to my site?</font>

740
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:29,108
<font color="yellow">And why do you run away?</font>

741
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,648
<font color="yellow">Do you feel guilty?</font>

742
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,808
<font color="yellow">I don't feel guilty. I went to look for my necklace.</font>

743
00:50:35,508 --> 00:50:38,748
<font color="yellow">By the way, why did you take my toiletries?</font>

744
00:50:39,948 --> 00:50:43,348
<font color="yellow">Don't lie to me. What did you do to my toiletries last night?</font>

745
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:47,748
<font color="yellow">Did you touch my things? Did you use my towel or not?</font>

746
00:50:47,848 --> 00:50:49,248
<font color="yellow">Are you a pervert?</font>

747
00:50:50,878 --> 00:50:53,378
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, do you want Tangsuyuk?</font>

748
00:50:53,578 --> 00:50:55,008
<font color="yellow">Add in fried dumplings.</font>

749
00:50:55,278 --> 00:50:57,378
<font color="yellow">Tangsuyuk and fried dumplings, please.</font>

750
00:51:04,078 --> 00:51:05,748
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

751
00:51:06,278 --> 00:51:07,678
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

752
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:12,048
<font color="yellow">you want to know if I remember this guy's face?</font>

753
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:16,378
<font color="yellow">This is the guy you faced before you went inside there.</font>

754
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:18,908
<font color="yellow">Can you remember his face?</font>

755
00:51:21,548 --> 00:51:22,978
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

756
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:41,648
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Where are you?</font>

757
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,078
<font color="yellow">I'm in the subway.</font>

758
00:51:43,608 --> 00:51:46,548
<font color="yellow">- Are you going home? - Yes. Why?</font>

759
00:51:46,878 --> 00:51:49,578
<font color="yellow">You didn't even say you were going home.</font>

760
00:51:50,278 --> 00:51:53,378
<font color="yellow">Do you know we didn't even have a meal together since you came back?</font>

761
00:51:54,348 --> 00:51:56,648
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. Let's have it this week.</font>

763
00:51:58,848 --> 00:52:01,608
<font color="yellow">Are you sure it's not because of Mr. Park?</font>

764
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:04,608
<font color="yellow">I'm sure.</font>

765
00:52:06,308 --> 00:52:08,348
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you driving the company's car?</font>

766
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:10,248
<font color="yellow">I will use from next week.</font>

767
00:52:10,548 --> 00:52:12,648
<font color="yellow">For now, public transportation will be better.</font>

768
00:52:13,308 --> 00:52:15,608
<font color="yellow">Okay, then. I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

769

780
00:53:23,348 --> 00:53:24,778
<font color="yellow">Why are you squirming?</font>

781
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:26,808
<font color="yellow">You look just like a cabbage worm.</font>

782
00:53:28,608 --> 00:53:29,878
<font color="yellow">A cabbage worm?</font>

783
00:53:29,878 --> 00:53:32,448

<font color="yellow">What do you want to talk about?</font>

785
00:53:38,578 --> 00:53:39,578
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

786
00:53:40,678 --> 00:53:42,548
<font color="yellow">it's about my brother's debt.</font>

<font color="yellow">Seo Cheol Min stole 200,000 dollars, right?</font>

788
00:53:45,108 --> 00:53:48,878
<font color="yellow">Please keep it down. What if someone hears you.</font>

789
00:53:52,978 --> 00:53:55,948
<font color="yellow">You must feel uncomfortable meeting me as one of your in-laws.</font>

790
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:57,648
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am.</font>

791
00:53:59,178 --> 00:54:00,348
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

792
00:54:00,348 --> 00:54:03,308
<font color="yellow">Why? Were you going to run away?</font>

793
00:54:04,048 --> 00:54:07,808
<font color="yellow">What? I told you I will pay you back.</font>

794
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:09,748
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

795
00:54:10,378 --> 00:54:11,708
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

796
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,608
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes. Imagine you see...</font>

797
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:16,708
<font color="yellow">the person you need to pay 200,000 dollars back every day.</font>

798
00:54:18,148 --> 00:54:20,208
<font color="yellow">Wherever I look, all I see is the debt I have to pay back.</font>

799
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:22,708
<font color="yellow">When I eat, I see the debt. When I say hi, I see the debt.</font>

800
00:54:22,748 --> 00:54:26,078
<font color="yellow">Hello. Good morning and then I see the debt again.</font>

801
00:54:28,278 --> 00:54:30,648
<font color="yellow">Think how uncomfortable this must be for me.</font>

802
00:54:32,308 --> 00:54:35,278
<font color="yellow">Then what do you want me to do?</font>

803
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,478
<font color="yellow">Should I just stay in my room?</font>

804
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:40,278
<font color="yellow">That's not what I meant.</font>

805
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,178
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

806
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:47,578
<font color="yellow">Pleas keep this a secret to my grandmother.</font>

807
00:54:48,178 --> 00:54:50,278
<font color="yellow">That's what I wanted to ask.</font>

808
00:54:53,048 --> 00:54:54,478
<font color="yellow">My grandmother swore she would...</font>

809
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:58,708
<font color="yellow">never move into her in-law's house, but she moved in because of me.</font>

810
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,848
<font color="yellow">She couldn't let me sleep in saunas.</font>

811
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:05,808
<font color="yellow">But imagine if she finds out that he owes you 200,000 dollars.</font>

812
00:55:06,508 --> 00:55:08,808
<font color="yellow">That will kill her.</font>

813
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:10,378
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

814
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:15,308
<font color="yellow">please keep it a secret to my grandmother.</font>

815
00:55:15,778 --> 00:55:17,878
<font color="yellow">I'm begging you.</font>

816
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:19,778
<font color="yellow">Please.</font>

817
00:55:21,778 --> 00:55:23,678
<font color="yellow">Is begging your specialty?</font>

818
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,278
<font color="yellow">Don't you have a dream?</font>

819
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,478
<font color="yellow">A dream?</font>

820
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:45,108
<font color="yellow">You looked like you knew what you wanted and had your own aspiration.</font>

821
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:47,608
<font color="yellow">Don't you have any goal?</font>

822
00:55:49,008 --> 00:55:52,878
<font color="yellow">I do, but I'm in a predicament now.</font>

823
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:58,348
<font color="yellow">Anyway, are you going to keep it a secret or not?</font>

824
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:02,278
<font color="yellow">- You are my in-law. - Then what will you do for me?</font>

825
00:56:04,008 --> 00:56:06,248
<font color="yellow">- Yes? - Yes, we are in-laws,</font>

826
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:07,578
<font color="yellow">but money's a different matter.</font>

827
00:56:08,178 --> 00:56:09,608
<font color="yellow">What can you do for me in return?</font>

828
00:56:13,678 --> 00:56:15,808
<font color="yellow">What do you want from me?</font>

829
00:56:16,378 --> 00:56:17,808
<font color="yellow">What do I need to do?</font>

830
00:56:19,178 --> 00:56:21,448
<font color="yellow">- What will you make me to do? - I don't know.</font>

831
00:56:21,648 --> 00:56:23,248
<font color="yellow">I'll think it over tonight.</font>

832
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:25,608
<font color="yellow">Will it be hard?</font>

833
00:56:27,078 --> 00:56:29,048
<font color="yellow">Will it be something embarrassing?</font>

834
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:32,978
<font color="yellow">- Something embarrassing? Like what? - I mean...</font>

835
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,808
<font color="yellow">Things like ringing the door bell and running. Or singing out loud.</font>

836
00:56:37,948 --> 00:56:39,678
<font color="yellow">That's how you must have played with your brother.</font>

837
00:56:43,808 --> 00:56:45,648
<font color="yellow">What will you ask me to do?</font>

838
00:56:46,478 --> 00:56:49,808
<font color="yellow">I can't sleep when I'm curious. Excuse me.</font>

839
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,608
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

840
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:55,678
<font color="yellow">What will I have to do? I'm not going to make a fool of myself.</font>

841
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:58,308
<font color="yellow">What will it be?</font>

842
00:56:58,508 --> 00:57:01,478
<font color="yellow">Please, are you even listening?</font>

843
00:57:05,078 --> 00:57:07,948
<font color="yellow">You can't ever be a free rider.</font>

844
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,308
<font color="yellow">People should feel a sense of honor.</font>

845
00:57:12,478 --> 00:57:13,778
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know.</font>

846
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:19,878
<font color="yellow">- Start sweeping from that side. - Okay.</font>

847
00:57:40,778 --> 00:57:41,808
<font color="yellow">Let's see.</font>

848
00:57:44,108 --> 00:57:45,708
<font color="yellow">It's perfect.</font>

849
00:57:46,108 --> 00:57:48,308
<font color="yellow">I guess you really went to an art school.</font>

850
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:51,048
<font color="yellow">I haven't been drawing for a while now,</font>

851
00:57:51,048 --> 00:57:52,578
<font color="yellow">so this took me some time.</font>

852
00:57:54,278 --> 00:57:55,278
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

853
00:57:56,748 --> 00:57:59,748
<font color="yellow">Gosh. Jeong Eun, you heavy drinker.</font>

854
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:02,478
<font color="yellow">She'd be perfect if she doesn't drink that much.</font>

855
00:58:02,578 --> 00:58:04,308
<font color="yellow">She'd be drunk as a skunk...</font>

856
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:07,108
<font color="yellow">and sleep on the bench over there.</font>

857
00:58:08,078 --> 00:58:12,048
<font color="yellow">I'm saying I'd set you up with a good man if you didn't.</font>

858
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:16,578
<font color="yellow">Gosh. This is so detailed.</font>

859
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,248
<font color="yellow">Are you sure this is how that man looked like?</font>

860
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:23,508
<font color="yellow">Don't you know me?</font>

861
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:25,448
<font color="yellow">I have a memory of Einstein.</font>

862
00:58:25,678 --> 00:58:28,108
<font color="yellow">I never forget the things I saw.</font>

863
00:58:29,078 --> 00:58:31,008
<font color="yellow">Can I go now?</font>

864
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,048
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

865
00:58:32,648 --> 00:58:34,978
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun. Let's have a drink sometime.</font>

866
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,108
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

867
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:44,178
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

868
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,708
<font color="yellow">can't you just catch him using his license plate number?</font>

869
00:58:49,148 --> 00:58:51,278
<font color="yellow">Do you remember his license plate number?</font>

870
00:58:52,448 --> 00:58:54,648
<font color="yellow">Of course. He didn't cover the front license plate.</font>

871
00:58:55,148 --> 00:58:58,548
<font color="yellow">It's 84 N 785... Something.</font>

872
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:01,478
<font color="yellow">What can it be?</font>

873
00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:05,578
<font color="yellow">Hey. You should have told us about the plate number sooner.</font>

874
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:07,978
<font color="yellow">You should have asked me about it first.</font>

875
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:09,848
<font color="yellow">You little... She is driving me crazy.</font>

876
00:59:12,278 --> 00:59:15,278
<font color="yellow">You should have told me that you needed me as a witness sooner.</font>

877
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:17,308
<font color="yellow">You impaired my image.</font>

878
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:21,478
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do? People in this neighborhood talk a lot.</font>

879
00:59:24,378 --> 00:59:25,648
<font color="yellow">Didn't you...</font>

880
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:28,708
<font color="yellow">build your image by drinking alcohol...</font>

881
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:30,808
<font color="yellow">here and there?</font>

882
00:59:31,978 --> 00:59:34,678
<font color="yellow">You're sharp. You don't miss anything.</font>

883
00:59:37,508 --> 00:59:39,448
<font color="yellow">It must've hurt very badly.</font>

884
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:41,578
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

885
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:48,208
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

886
00:59:49,048 --> 00:59:52,348
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking while looking at your face.</font>

887
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:54,978
<font color="yellow">Why do you...</font>

888
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:57,078
<font color="yellow">look so familiar?</font>

889
01:00:00,748 --> 01:00:03,648
<font color="yellow">We've met three times including today. Am I right?</font>

890
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:06,248
<font color="yellow">No. I don't mean that.</font>

891
01:00:08,148 --> 01:00:10,278
<font color="yellow">I saw you somewhere before.</font>

892
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:14,008
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

893
01:00:25,848 --> 01:00:28,148
<font color="yellow">Have you lived in Iceland?</font>

894
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:30,348
<font color="yellow">Maybe in a place where you can see auroras.</font>

895
01:00:31,248 --> 01:00:32,778
<font color="yellow">I've never even been there.</font>

896
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:35,048
<font color="yellow">I suppose. You're a construction manager.</font>

897
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:38,108
<font color="yellow">Or maybe you were on a trip to the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia...</font>

898
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:39,708
<font color="yellow">to see the sunset.</font>

899
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:43,248
<font color="yellow">There was a guy who approached to a tall lama,</font>

900
01:00:43,248 --> 01:00:45,078
<font color="yellow">got spat at by it,</font>

901
01:00:45,078 --> 01:00:48,278
<font color="yellow">and shouted out, "Oh, my gosh!" Aren't you him?</font>

902
01:00:48,948 --> 01:00:51,278
<font color="yellow">Lamas are animals that look like you, right?</font>

903
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,848
<font color="yellow">What? I can't believe this guy.</font>

904
01:00:57,108 --> 01:00:58,878
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I know.</font>

905
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:02,448
<font color="yellow">You're the guy who was selling water and mangos...</font>

906
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:06,578
<font color="yellow">at the supermarket in Kenya's Tsavo National Park. Am I right?</font>

907
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:10,308
<font color="yellow">Please stop.</font>

908
01:01:23,448 --> 01:01:26,108
<font color="yellow">Were you the guy who smacked my head...</font>

909
01:01:26,108 --> 01:01:28,608
<font color="yellow">to see the Mona Lisa in the Louvre in Paris?</font>

910
01:01:28,908 --> 01:01:32,378
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit me? I wanted to kill you.</font>

911
01:01:36,108 --> 01:01:38,148
<font color="yellow">Where did I see him? Where was it?</font>

912
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:41,548
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

913
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:45,278
