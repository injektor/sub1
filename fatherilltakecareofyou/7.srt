<font color="yellow">Sir, these are the final 10 pieces for the new writer prize.</font>

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,920
<font color="yellow">Are there any good ones?</font>

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,690
<font color="yellow">Well. Why don't you read them yourself?</font>

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,820
<font color="yellow">Where is Producer Kim?</font>

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,890
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure where he is.</font>

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,390
<font color="yellow">(The Portrait of Family)</font>

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,260
<font color="yellow">Hurry inside.</font>

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,320
<font color="yellow">Wait. I am going inside.</font>

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,890
<font color="yellow">Hurry inside.</font>

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,420
<font color="yellow">- Hurry. - Why do you keep pushing me?</font>

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,260
<font color="yellow">When did I push you?</font>

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:53,060
<font color="yellow">It's because you are walking too slowly.</font>

13
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,360
<font color="yellow">Director Han, I caught Seo Cheol Min's sister!</font>

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,160
<font color="yellow">Aren't I talented?</font>

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,960
<font color="yellow">Seo Cheol Min's sister?</font>

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,720
<font color="yellow">Let's start the meeting.</font>

17
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,560
<font color="yellow">- What's happening? - Director Bang.</font>

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,160
<font color="yellow">Director Bang, I caught Seo Cheol Min's sister at last.</font>

19
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,160
<font color="yellow">Look. She's right here.</font>

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,020
<font color="yellow">So you mean she is the sister of Seo Cheol Min who...</font>

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,760
<font color="yellow">ran away with our money?</font>

22
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,460
<font color="yellow">That's exactly right.</font>

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,660
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim, you did something amazing this time.</font>

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,390
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it. I did it out of love for my company.</font>

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,960
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,660
<font color="yellow">- It's a long story. - How long?</font>

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,160
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo.</font>

28
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,990
<font color="yellow">Didn't she bring your backpack from Taiwan...</font>

29
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,260
<font color="yellow">before you came back to Korea?</font>

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,790
<font color="yellow">- That's right. - Then let me get this straight.</font>

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,960
<font color="yellow">Out of the blue, a woman came to return your bag.</font>

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,060
<font color="yellow">She said you two met in Taiwan.</font>

33
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,730
<font color="yellow">She lost her passport and you helped her to issue a new one.</font>

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,020
<font color="yellow">Let's just say it's possible because you are nice...</font>

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,660
<font color="yellow">to everyone.</font>

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,790
<font color="yellow">But did you know...</font>

37
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,320
<font color="yellow">she was Seo Cheol Min's sister or not?</font>

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,890
<font color="yellow">What is your name, Miss?</font>

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,490
<font color="yellow">My name is Oh Dong Hui.</font>

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,560
<font color="yellow">Is it? Okay. Ms. Oh.</font>

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,790
<font color="yellow">You are in a serious predicament.</font>

42
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,290
<font color="yellow">Because your brother ran away with our money,</font>

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,590
<font color="yellow">our company faced a great loss.</font>

44
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,260
<font color="yellow">That brings me to my next question.</font>

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,660
<font color="yellow">Where is your brother?</font>

46
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,960
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

47
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,420
<font color="yellow">- She doesn't know. - I mean...</font>

48
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,590
<font color="yellow">you must keep in touch with your brother.</font>

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
<font color="yellow">I haven't heard from him.</font>

50
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,560
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,620
<font color="yellow">Your brother disappeared with 200,000 dollars.</font>

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,690
<font color="yellow">How can you be so irresponsible?</font>

53
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,720
<font color="yellow">You haven't heard from him? Is that all you're going to say?</font>

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,720
<font color="yellow">Do you want to go to jail?</font>

55
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,020
<font color="yellow">But why is your last name Oh?</font>

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,260
<font color="yellow">Hey, do you think that's important at this moment?</font>

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,560
<font color="yellow">She doesn't know where her brother is.</font>

58
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,660
<font color="yellow">If they are siblings, she should be Seo Dong Hui. Don't you think so?</font>

59
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,490
<font color="yellow">But why is her last name Oh?</font>

60
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,260
<font color="yellow">Why is that so?</font>

61
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,490
<font color="yellow">Why can't you say anything?</font>

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,760
<font color="yellow">- I'll tell you later. - Why can't you tell me now?</font>

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,890
<font color="yellow">It's complicated.</font>

64
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,020
<font color="yellow">Are you going to stay silent?</font>

65
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,120
<font color="yellow">Look. It's right. Her name is Oh Dong Hui.</font>

66
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,720
<font color="yellow">You got the wrong person. Come on.</font>

67
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,720
<font color="yellow">No, it can't be. I'm sure it's her.</font>

68
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,220
<font color="yellow">In Taiwan, you were Seo Cheol Min's sister.</font>

69
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,120
<font color="yellow">How is this possible?</font>

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,560
<font color="yellow">He is my brother.</font>

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,720
<font color="yellow">He is my second cousin,</font>

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,220
<font color="yellow">but we grew up together.</font>

73
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,160
<font color="yellow">So he's like my real brother.</font>

74
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,620
<font color="yellow">Then you should have told me from the beginning.</font>

75
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,190
<font color="yellow">Isn't it hard to ask her to take legal responsibility?</font>

76
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,860
<font color="yellow">She's not the thief and she's his second cousin.</font>

77
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,720
<font color="yellow">Your name was Dong Hui, right?</font>

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
<font color="yellow">Do you have other immediate family members?</font>

79
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,790
<font color="yellow">I don't think you have to be here for this.</font>

80
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,030
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong, how can you say such thing?</font>

81
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,990
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim, you're hopeless, too.</font>

82
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,890
<font color="yellow">We aren't loan sharks.</font>

83
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,320
<font color="yellow">How can we ask her to be responsible when she had nothing to do with it?</font>

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,560
<font color="yellow">That's exactly my point.</font>

85
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,820
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't expect too much from him.</font>

86
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,090
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,790
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim, send her home.</font>

88
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,790
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - Get her information. Let her go.</font>

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,190
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you, Director Bang?</font>

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,590
<font color="yellow">I told you that we won't be handling this matter.</font>

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,460
<font color="yellow">I told you let the legal department to take care of it.</font>

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,620
<font color="yellow">You must not try to solve the problem personally.</font>

93
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,890
<font color="yellow">I won't accept it.</font>

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,160
<font color="yellow">I'm not trying to solve it personally. I just...</font>

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,360
<font color="yellow">It is neither my nor Director Han's problem.</font>

96
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,620
<font color="yellow">It's the legal department's problem.</font>

97
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,260
<font color="yellow">As a matter of fact, it turns out that she's not his real sister.</font>

98
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,660
<font color="yellow">She's his second cousin.</font>

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,120
<font color="yellow">What Producer Kim did was pointless.</font>

100
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,960
<font color="yellow">Don't make a fuss and let her go.</font>

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,820
<font color="yellow">Watch it. Goodness.</font>

102
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,790
<font color="yellow">Perhaps, my job has something to do with it. How can I let her go...</font>

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,990
<font color="yellow">due to a misunderstanding? It's like a drama.</font>

104
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,090
<font color="yellow">A second cousin? She can't take responsibility legally?</font>

105
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,190
<font color="yellow">If you live under the same roof, that makes you family.</font>

106
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,620
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

107
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,760
<font color="yellow">Don't think I'll back down and give up.</font>

108
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,860
<font color="yellow">They might let you go because they are soft, but I assure you I'm not.</font>

109
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,860
<font color="yellow">I'll chase you to the end of the world.</font>

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,090
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure I get...</font>

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,720
<font color="yellow">the money your cousin robbed.</font>

112
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

113
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,260
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he have a grandmother?</font>

114
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,260
<font color="yellow">Give her number.</font>

115
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,990
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - Give me his grandmother's number.</font>

116
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,890
<font color="yellow">Have this.</font>

117
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,820
<font color="yellow">When it's all melted, my class will be over.</font>

118
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,560
<font color="yellow">Sang Woo.</font>

120
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,520
<font color="yellow">Don't go anywhere. Stay here.</font>

121
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,790
<font color="yellow">- Did you get that? - Yes.</font>

122
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
<font color="yellow">Welcome.</font>

123
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,690
<font color="yellow">How can I help you?</font>

124
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,190
<font color="yellow">I'm looking for someone.</font>

125
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,190
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

126
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,320
<font color="yellow">I'm from Seoul.</font>

127
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,460
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please come this way.</font>

128
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,130
<font color="yellow">Is it him?</font>

129
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
<font color="yellow">No, he's my youngest son.</font>

130
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

131
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,590
<font color="yellow">Until when did you raise him?</font>

132
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,220
<font color="yellow">I raised him for about a year.</font>

133
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,290
<font color="yellow">I had a flower shop in Bangbae-dong 33 years ago.</font>

134
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,390
<font color="yellow">On a rainy day, a boy was...</font>

135
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,990
<font color="yellow">crying in front of my shop.</font>

136
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,190
<font color="yellow">I asked him why he was crying.</font>

137
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,660
<font color="yellow">He said he was lost and he was sobbing.</font>

138
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,890
<font color="yellow">So I took him to my house and raised him.</font>

139
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,990
<font color="yellow">But someone must have filed a report.</font>

140
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,660
<font color="yellow">Back then,</font>

141
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,820
<font color="yellow">I wasn't well off to legally adopt him.</font>

142
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,590
<font color="yellow">So the police took him away.</font>

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,720
<font color="yellow">Where did he go?</font>

144
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,660
<font color="yellow">He was sent to an orphanage located in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province.</font>

145
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,690
<font color="yellow">I had affection for him since I raised him,</font>

146
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,890
<font color="yellow">so I visited him every month.</font>

147
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,520
<font color="yellow">When did you last visit him?</font>

148
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,820
<font color="yellow">It's been a long time.</font>

149
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,130
<font color="yellow">He turned 20 when I last saw him.</font>

150
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,390
<font color="yellow">Right. He worked here for a while.</font>

151
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,820
<font color="yellow">Do you have a photo of him?</font>

152
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,320
<font color="yellow">Of course, it must be inside the house. Please wait here.</font>

153
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Kim. - Yes?</font>

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,090
<font color="yellow">I told you not to stack materials up in the passage. Clear the area.</font>

155
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,290
<font color="yellow">No, leave the electrical cords.</font>

156
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,360
<font color="yellow">- Electrical team will handle them. - Okay.</font>

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,490
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park,</font>

158
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,360
<font color="yellow">there's no handrail up there. Be careful when you install elevators.</font>

159
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,820
<font color="yellow">- Yes, Sir. - Good.</font>

160
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why do they never put handrails there?</font>

161
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,590
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

162
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,860
<font color="yellow">You know me, don't you?</font>

163
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,520
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

164
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,060
<font color="yellow">I'm the good neighbor who helped you catch the thief.</font>

165
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,060
<font color="yellow">So what does he have to give you back?</font>

166
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,590
<font color="yellow">My toiletries and my precious necklace...</font>

167
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,690
<font color="yellow">are in Mr. Lee's house.</font>

168
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,560
<font color="yellow">- A necklace? - Yes.</font>

169
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,090
<font color="yellow">It's the most valuable thing to me, so I need to get it back right away.</font>

170
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,120
<font color="yellow">But he doesn't seem to have any intention to give back.</font>

171
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,460
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's a pervert.</font>

172
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,860
<font color="yellow">Still, I'm not sure if he'll be okay with this.</font>

173
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,890
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

174
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,020
<font color="yellow">We've been friends since three years ago in New York.</font>

175
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,260
<font color="yellow">- Friends? - Yes.</font>

176
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,590
<font color="yellow">- Please go in. - Okay.</font>

177
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,160
<font color="yellow">Mr. Lee really hates to let people in his place.</font>

178
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,590
<font color="yellow">I came here just to get the specifications,</font>

179
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,660
<font color="yellow">but if he finds out about you, he might get really angry.</font>

180
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,220
<font color="yellow">I'm the one who must be really angry.</font>

181
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,790
<font color="yellow">He said he'd give them back.</font>

182
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,520
<font color="yellow">Anyway, hurry up. We should leave soon.</font>

183
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,190
<font color="yellow">I have this one. Let me see.</font>

184
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,590
<font color="yellow">The window...</font>

185
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,620
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

186
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:01,260
<font color="yellow">Where on earth did he keep them?</font>

187
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,760
<font color="yellow">Wait. Did he install the locks on both sides?</font>

188
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,760
<font color="yellow">He is really weird.</font>

189
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,760
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

190
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,390
<font color="yellow">It's Bangbae-dong's model village.</font>

191
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,720
<font color="yellow">Sure, he manages construction sites.</font>

192
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,090
<font color="yellow">Well, let me see.</font>

193
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,290
<font color="yellow">This is Mina supermarket,</font>

194
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,220
<font color="yellow">and this is the sauna.</font>

195
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,220
<font color="yellow">This where Mr. Jung's lives,</font>

196
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,990
<font color="yellow">and this is Yoon Jae's house.</font>

197
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,120
<font color="yellow">I found Ms. Yoon's hospital here.</font>

198
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,860
<font color="yellow">Our house is right at the center of the town.</font>

199
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,190
<font color="yellow">It's such a lovely neighborhood.</font>

200
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,420
<font color="yellow">If found it.</font>

201
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,190
<font color="yellow">Why did he keep these in such place?</font>

202
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
<font color="yellow">Do you mean this door knob?</font>

203
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,990
<font color="yellow">We can't fix this.</font>

204
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,160
<font color="yellow">A skilled technician must be here.</font>

205
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,360
<font color="yellow">Listen up. The security system doesn't operate because of this.</font>

206
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,820
<font color="yellow">It's a wealthy town, so it must be fixed right away!</font>

207
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,020
<font color="yellow">Gosh, hold on.</font>

208
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
<font color="yellow">Miss! Did you find yours?</font>

209
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,790
<font color="yellow">Yes, I found one.</font>

210
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,160
<font color="yellow">Where did he put my necklace?</font>

211
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,660
<font color="yellow">Where is he now?</font>

212
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,020
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

213
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,820
<font color="yellow">he died from a car accident when he was 21.</font>

214
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,190
<font color="yellow">He went to Seoul to find a new job...</font>

215
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,520
<font color="yellow">and got into a car accident.</font>

216
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,990
<font color="yellow">What's wrong? Are you all right?</font>

217
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,090
<font color="yellow">What is this?</font>

218
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,720
<font color="yellow">It is really old. Isn't this someone else's as well?</font>

219
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,360
<font color="yellow">(Seongsu Corporation)</font>

220
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,060
<font color="yellow">Isn't Seongsu Coporation the company...</font>

221
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,320
<font color="yellow">where my uncle used to work at?</font>

222
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,420
<font color="yellow">Did he also work there?</font>

223
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,320
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Is he okay?</font>

224
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,590
<font color="yellow">- Please wake up. - Please let us take the patient.</font>

225
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,690
<font color="yellow">- Will he be all right? - Mr. Park.</font>

226
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,560
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - What happened to him?</font>

227
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,690
<font color="yellow">What? Mr. Park fell from the building?</font>

228
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,690
<font color="yellow">I told him to be careful!</font>

229
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,990
<font color="yellow">Did you call 911?</font>

230
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,620
<font color="yellow">Miss, close the door when you leave,</font>

231
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,790
<font color="yellow">okay?</font>

232
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,560
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

233
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,890
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Sir!</font>

234
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,220
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

235
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,490
<font color="yellow">Is it locked?</font>

236
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,990
<font color="yellow">Sir, please let me out.</font>

237
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,490
<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

<font color="yellow">Sir!</font>

239
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,060
<font color="yellow">Gosh, am I locked in?</font>

240
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,690
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

241
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,360
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry tell you the bad news.</font>

242
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,990
<font color="yellow">Please don't be. It's okay.</font>

243
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,160
<font color="yellow">Thank you for letting me know...</font>

244
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,990
<font color="yellow">what happened to him.</font>

245
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,330
<font color="yellow">Are you his older brother?</font>

246
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,420
<font color="yellow">I think I am.</font>

247
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,990
<font color="yellow">Why isn't your sister with you here?</font>

248
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,890
<font color="yellow">He talked about his sister...</font>

249
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,020
<font color="yellow">very often.</font>

250
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,060
<font color="yellow">He said his sister raised him as their mother left them.</font>

251
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,590
<font color="yellow">I think I'm in the wrong place.</font>

252
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,660
<font color="yellow">Pardon?</font>

253
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,490
<font color="yellow">There were only two of us.</font>

254
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,760
<font color="yellow">We had no one else except ourselves.</font>

255
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,520
<font color="yellow">We only had each other...</font>

256
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,390
<font color="yellow">in the world.</font>

257
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,760
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

258
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,620
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

259
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,960
<font color="yellow">Please take it.</font>

260
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,890
<font color="yellow">Although he's not my brother,</font>

261
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,860
<font color="yellow">let me repay your kindness...</font>

262
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,660
<font color="yellow">to take care of the poor boy for over 10 years.</font>

263
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,690
<font color="yellow">Please stay healthy.</font>

264
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,060
<font color="yellow">Please wait. Wait a minute!</font>

265
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,020
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

266
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,090
<font color="yellow">How did it go?</font>

267
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,760
<font color="yellow">We were 100 percent confident when we found him.</font>

268
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,160
<font color="yellow">He also lived in Bangbae-dong.</font>

269
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,460
<font color="yellow">You're fired.</font>

270
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,760
<font color="yellow">My brother isn't dead.</font>

271
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,660
<font color="yellow">I fired him. He's a conman.</font>

272
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,720
<font color="yellow">He found someone who's dead.</font>

273
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,690
<font color="yellow">Don't let him work in that field again.</font>

274
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,890
<font color="yellow">Mother, I am back!</font>

275
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,330
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

276
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,060
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

277
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,330
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd feel lonesome, so I came to see you.</font>

278
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,960
<font color="yellow">And to bring you some onions.</font>

279
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,020
<font color="yellow">Then, put them in the kitchen and leave.</font>

280
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

281
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,890
<font color="yellow">Mother,</font>

282
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,760
<font color="yellow">I'd also like to make you lunch.</font>

283
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,660
<font color="yellow">I bought your favorite small octopus.</font>

284
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,960
<font color="yellow">I was too busy moving in and taking care of Ji Hoon.</font>

285
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,090
<font color="yellow">I think I haven't been a good daughter-in-law for a while.</font>

286
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,390
<font color="yellow">It won't take long. I will cook a delicious octopus stir-fry.</font>

287
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,260
<font color="yellow">Let's eat lunch together.</font>

288
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,290
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into her?</font>

289
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,490
<font color="yellow">Mother, your lunch is ready.</font>

290
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,020
<font color="yellow">It's amazing.</font>

291
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,890
<font color="yellow">Please take your seat. I cooked the stir-fry and bean sprouts soup.</font>

292
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
<font color="yellow">Come on. Sit.</font>

293
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,790
<font color="yellow">You should eat the stir-fry when it's still hot.</font>

294
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,060
<font color="yellow">I never expected this.</font>

295
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,090
<font color="yellow">I'll eat it since you cooked it.</font>

296
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,960
<font color="yellow">How is it?</font>

297
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,830
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

298
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,690
<font color="yellow">By the way, the octopus must've been expensive. How much was it?</font>

299
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,360
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Mother. It didn't break my bank.</font>

300
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,420
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

301
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,620
<font color="yellow">I will cook it more often.</font>

302
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,160
<font color="yellow">Come on. Eat before it gets cold.</font>

303
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,960
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

304
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,020
<font color="yellow">The octopus is very soft and delicious.</font>

305
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,520
<font color="yellow">Right, Mother? Eat a lot.</font>

306
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,660
<font color="yellow">Do you not like bean sprouts soup?</font>

307
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,560
<font color="yellow">- No, I am going to eat it later. - Right!</font>

308
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,890
<font color="yellow">You hate bean sprouts soup.</font>

309
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,760
<font color="yellow">I forgot.</font>

310
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,720
<font color="yellow">- No, I don't hate it. - Don't say that.</font>

311
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:06,120
<font color="yellow">Because Father drank every day,</font>

312
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,020
<font color="yellow">you cooked bean sprouts so many times.</font>

313
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,560
<font color="yellow">You said you even hate the smell of bean sprouts.</font>

314
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,960
<font color="yellow">It must have been so tough for you.</font>

315
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,160
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. It was so tactless of me to say it.</font>

316
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,260
<font color="yellow">Right!</font>

317
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,790
<font color="yellow">I heard Seong Sik always came home drunk...</font>

318
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,820
<font color="yellow">when he was in college.</font>

319
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,320
<font color="yellow">Don't even bring that up. Your father-in-law couldn't even...</font>

320
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,790
<font color="yellow">compare to him. Whenever I think about how much he used to drink...</font>

321
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,690
<font color="yellow">I know! He troubled you by getting involved...</font>

322
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,720
<font color="yellow">in student movements, other activities, and all.</font>

323
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,590
<font color="yellow">It must have been so tough for you.</font>

324
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,290
<font color="yellow">But still,</font>

325
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,360
<font color="yellow">thanks to that, Seong Hoon and Hye Joo got married.</font>

326
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,090
<font color="yellow">If you think about that, it wasn't that bad after all.</font>

327
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,360
<font color="yellow">Right, Mother?</font>

328
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,260
<font color="yellow">Come in.</font>

329
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,720
<font color="yellow">Come in. Come in.</font>

330
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,590
<font color="yellow">Come in. Come in.</font>

331
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

332
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
<font color="yellow">This is my friend Yeong Cheol.</font>

333
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,820
<font color="yellow">- Say hello. She's my mom. - Hello.</font>

334
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,860
<font color="yellow">And she is...</font>

335
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,290
<font color="yellow">the woman I like and admire the most.</font>

336
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,260
<font color="yellow">She's Hye Joo.</font>

337
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,990
<font color="yellow">Hello, Mother.</font>

338
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,290
<font color="yellow">My name is Seo Hye Joo.</font>

339
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,590
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik drank too much,</font>

340
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,260
<font color="yellow">so we thought we'd take him home.</font>

341
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,190
<font color="yellow">Mom, we still have the wine you made, right?</font>

342
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,220
<font color="yellow">Please let us drink just one bottle of it.</font>

343
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,020
<font color="yellow">Come in, guys. Come this way.</font>

344
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:52,060
<font color="yellow">Come on. Please follow me.</font>

345
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,020
<font color="yellow">Come on, Hye Joo.</font>

346
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,160
<font color="yellow">I will pay for everything today! Just keep drinking!</font>

347
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,060
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

348
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,520
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

349
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,860
<font color="yellow">Why do you always cook bean sprouts soup?</font>

350
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,760
<font color="yellow">- Seong Sik drank a lot yesterday. - That's got nothing to do with me.</font>

351
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,820
<font color="yellow">Then you should have cooked another soup for me.</font>

352
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,960
<font color="yellow">You know I hate bean sprouts soup with green onions.</font>

353
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

354
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,660
<font color="yellow">I forgot to skip the green onions.</font>

355
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,520
<font color="yellow">Next time, I will cook another soup for you.</font>

356
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,820
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

357
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,090
<font color="yellow">how many times did I tell you that bracken is bad for men?</font>

358
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,990
<font color="yellow">No, it's not.</font>

359
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,890
<font color="yellow">I heard it's got nothing bad for men.</font>

360
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,690
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

361
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,990
<font color="yellow">I entered Jin Seong Ilbo at the top of my batch.</font>

362
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,160
<font color="yellow">How can you not trust what your journalist son is saying?</font>

363
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,990
<font color="yellow">Okay. Fine.</font>

364
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,420
<font color="yellow">I won't cook the bracken again.</font>

365
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,860
<font color="yellow">- Cook me a fried egg. - Okay.</font>

366
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,120
<font color="yellow">Hey. Hye Joo?</font>

367
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

368
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,820
<font color="yellow">You should wake up now.</font>

369
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,520
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

370
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,460
<font color="yellow">Girl. You should go home.</font>

371
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
<font color="yellow">You have to get married.</font>

372
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,320
<font color="yellow">You can't sleep here like this.</font>

373
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,520
<font color="yellow">Wake up now.</font>

374
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,560
<font color="yellow">You will have to marry a man one day.</font>

375
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,420
<font color="yellow">You know?</font>

376
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,090
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

377
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,620
<font color="yellow">Come.</font>

378
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,390
<font color="yellow">Take a seat. You should eat before you leave.</font>

379
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,060
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm sorry.</font>

380
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,060
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

381
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
<font color="yellow">It's hot. Here.</font>

382
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,090
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

383
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,590
<font color="yellow">Goodness! I'm sorry, Mother.</font>

384
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,360
<font color="yellow">I must have reminded you of the bad memories.</font>

385
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,620
<font color="yellow">No, you didn't. Let's eat.</font>

386
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,890
<font color="yellow">Get that!</font>

387
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,820
<font color="yellow">This is why you need to have a good past.</font>

388
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,490
<font color="yellow">Watch me.</font>

389
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,220
<font color="yellow">I am going to make sure...</font>

390
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,960
<font color="yellow">to kick you out of this house.</font>

391
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,360
<font color="yellow">Your qualifications are more than enough,</font>

392
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,160
<font color="yellow">but unfortunately, we can't hire you this time.</font>

393
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,990
<font color="yellow">Can you ride a motorcycle?</font>

394
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,190
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course I can.</font>

395
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,960
<font color="yellow">- Are you all right? - I'm okay.</font>

396
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,120
<font color="yellow">Is my motorcycle okay? Darn it.</font>

397
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,790
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

398
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,420
<font color="yellow">Mother, I'm home.</font>

399
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,460
<font color="yellow">What are you up to, Mother?</font>

400
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,790
<font color="yellow">What do you care?</font>

401
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,990
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

402
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,220
<font color="yellow">I just came to say hi.</font>

403
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,220
<font color="yellow">We live together. Why would you say hi?</font>

404
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,620
<font color="yellow">But still, I came home from work.</font>

405
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,360
<font color="yellow">And also...</font>

406
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:29,120
<font color="yellow">I got the sugar donuts you like. Do you want to have some?</font>

407
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,290
<font color="yellow">No, thanks. I don't want any.</font>

408
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,290
<font color="yellow">Don't refuse it.</font>

409
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,320
<font color="yellow">Just try one.</font>

410
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,960
<font color="yellow">This is from a stall in front of my office,</font>

411
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,790
<font color="yellow">and it's really good. I said I don't want it!</font>

412
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,460
<font color="yellow">Did something happen to you today?</font>

413
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,090
<font color="yellow">Nothing happened.</font>

414
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,820
<font color="yellow">Then what's wrong?</font>

415
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,860
<font color="yellow">Do you hate me that much?</font>

416
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,520
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do.</font>

417
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,820
<font color="yellow">I hate you. How did an alcoholic protestor...</font>

418
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,390
<font color="yellow">become my first daughter-in-law?</font>

419
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,260
<font color="yellow">I hated you since the first time you came to my house.</font>

420
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,090
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring up the past out of the blue?</font>

421
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,720
<font color="yellow">I don't get it.</font>

422
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,860
<font color="yellow">What's gotten into her?</font>

423
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,260
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

424
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:55,960
<font color="yellow">I'll put this in the kitchen. Eat this when your hatred...</font>

425
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,520
<font color="yellow">towards me goes away a little.</font>

426
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,390
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

427
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,290
<font color="yellow">It's bean sprouts soup.</font>

428
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,790
<font color="yellow">What's this smell?</font>

429
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,160
<font color="yellow">I recognize this perfume scent.</font>

430
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,620
<font color="yellow">Kang Hee Sook you wicked witch!</font>

431
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,320
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

432
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,990
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

433
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,220
<font color="yellow">I always advise him to focus on being a lawyer...</font>

434
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,560
<font color="yellow">rather than being on TV.</font>

435
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,720
<font color="yellow">But my husband never listens to me.</font>

436
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,260
<font color="yellow">Men are always like that.</font>

437
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,860
<font color="yellow">He always yearns for something new...</font>

438
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,790
<font color="yellow">rather than earning profit.</font>

439
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,590
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to assist him.</font>

440
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,060
<font color="yellow">Goodness, is Atty. Park like that, too?</font>

441
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:28,760
<font color="yellow">Even so, you should stop him from going on TV.</font>

442
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,590
<font color="yellow">It's tough to be a public figure.</font>

443
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,220
<font color="yellow">Your privacy is never guaranteed.</font>

444
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,120
<font color="yellow">By the way, the coffee you sent me is delicious.</font>

445
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,120
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

446
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang, give me a cup of coffee, too.</font>

447
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,260
<font color="yellow">Yes, boss!</font>

448
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,820
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

449
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,720
<font color="yellow">I made a mistake.</font>

450
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,560
<font color="yellow">Can I call you back later?</font>

451
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,690
<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay.</font>

452
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

453
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

454
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,820
<font color="yellow">What's up, Hee Sook?</font>

455
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,390
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

456
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,390
<font color="yellow">Did I say something?</font>

457
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,260
<font color="yellow">What did you say when I was talking to Mrs. Park?</font>

458
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,790
<font color="yellow">I asked you for a cup of coffee. What's wrong?</font>

459
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,160
<font color="yellow">What did you say before that?</font>

460
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,090
<font color="yellow">What did you call me?</font>

461
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,520
<font color="yellow">What did I call you? Well, what did I call you?</font>

462
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,960
<font color="yellow">- I don't remember. - Hye Joo!</font>

463
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,890
<font color="yellow">Why would you yell?</font>

464
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,520
<font color="yellow">Will you keep doing this while living in the same house?</font>

465
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,090
<font color="yellow">Hey, Ms. Kang,</font>

466
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,020
<font color="yellow">If you do like this one more time, I won't let it slide.</font>

467
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,420
<font color="yellow">Do what?</font>

468
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,960
<font color="yellow">Don't come between Mother and I!</font>

469
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,790
<font color="yellow">I know so many of your secrets...</font>

470
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,060
<font color="yellow">from your three years of working.</font>

471
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,690
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to go on top of this house...</font>

472
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,460
<font color="yellow">and reveal all your secrets?</font>

473
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,120
<font color="yellow">I don't...</font>

474
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:24,990
<font color="yellow">I don't have any secrets. Okay?</font>

475
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,090
<font color="yellow">Think carefully.</font>

476
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,760
<font color="yellow">For your information, I won't reveal your dating history.</font>

477
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,230
<font color="yellow">Dating history? Do you think I had such a thing?</font>

478
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,390
<font color="yellow">No way.</font>

479
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,190
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

480
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,230
<font color="yellow">She's the one who's done wrong things!</font>

481
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,320
<font color="yellow">How do I kick her out?</font>

482
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,960
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo!</font>

483
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,620
<font color="yellow">Are you here to get a medical check-up?</font>

484
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,420
<font color="yellow">- Don't you weigh 100kg? - Stop it!</font>

485
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,460
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

486
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,190
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

487
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,890
<font color="yellow">We don't have time. I have to get done fast and go.</font>

488
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,090
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

489
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,730
<font color="yellow">You weigh 47kg.</font>

490
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,860
<font color="yellow">Goodness! What are you doing?</font>

491
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,060
<font color="yellow">My mother said she'll give me extra pocket money if I weigh 99kg.</font>

492
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,820
<font color="yellow">Put on your clothes. I will deduct 1kg from your weight.</font>

493
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,890
<font color="yellow">You're big enough.</font>

494
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,120
<font color="yellow">You weigh 121kg.</font>

495
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,860
<font color="yellow">When I subtract 1kg, it becomes 120kg.</font>

496
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,020
<font color="yellow">Say good bye to your allowance.</font>

497
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,660
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

498
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,790
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

499
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,820
<font color="yellow">Stop making a fuss. You look like you could even cook a cow.</font>

500
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,620
<font color="yellow">But it really hurts.</font>

501
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,420
<font color="yellow">What do you think your blood type is?</font>

502
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,660
<font color="yellow">- B. - How about you?</font>

503
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,790
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

504
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,790
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

505
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:21,290
<font color="yellow">Is it C?</font>

506
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,560
<font color="yellow">There's only "hepatitis C".</font>

507
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,190
<font color="yellow">I remembered it. It's O.</font>

508
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,160
<font color="yellow">- You're not joking, right? - No.</font>

509
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,260
<font color="yellow">Am I wrong?</font>

510
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,420
<font color="yellow">I think it's right. Is it right?</font>

511
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,160
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon</font>

512
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,460
<font color="yellow">Are you not going to eat your corn dog?</font>

513
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,960
<font color="yellow">We must eat because we had a blood test.</font>

514
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,260
<font color="yellow">By the way, don't you have tutoring?</font>

515
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,730
<font color="yellow">Attend the tutoring. Otherwise, your mom will be very upset.</font>

516
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,560
<font color="yellow">You're not going to eat it, right? Then I'll have yours.</font>

517
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,990
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

518
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,730
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

519
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,260
<font color="yellow">don't want to live.</font>

520
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,190
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

521
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,730
<font color="yellow">Because of my mom,</font>

522
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,390
<font color="yellow">I might die.</font>

523
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,390
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

524
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,190
<font color="yellow">Let go of me. Let's talk later.</font>

525
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,490
<font color="yellow">Let's talk today. I will tell you everything.</font>

526
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,620
<font color="yellow">Can you drink soju?</font>

527
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,660
<font color="yellow">What does that mean? That was a sharp question.</font>

528
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,790
<font color="yellow">I was just asking if you could drink soju.</font>

529
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,490
<font color="yellow">I think I've never drunk soju with you.</font>

530
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,520
<font color="yellow">Of course. I love wine.</font>

531
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,520
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

532
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

533
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,590
<font color="yellow">I knew she was Seo Cheol Min's little sister from the start.</font>

534
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,190
<font color="yellow">I don't know if it's okay for me to say this or not,</font>

535
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,820
<font color="yellow">but I just let her go.</font>

536
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,490
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

537
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,490
<font color="yellow">I told you before. It seems like she can't afford it.</font>

538
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,490
<font color="yellow">But if you let her go, you'd have to let everyone else go, too.</font>

539
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,660
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

540
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,020
<font color="yellow">But when you live life,</font>

541
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,120
<font color="yellow">there are people who really doesn't have anything.</font>

542
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,420
<font color="yellow">But they should at least take the legal responsibility</font>

543
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,020
<font color="yellow">for what they have done.</font>

544
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,120
<font color="yellow">Isn't that better for their lives as well?</font>

545
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,890
<font color="yellow">You can't just do something bad and refuse to be arrested.</font>

546
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,090
<font color="yellow">Stop drinking.</font>

547
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,190
<font color="yellow">You never drink this fast.</font>

548
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,730
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

549
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,730
<font color="yellow">You know,</font>

550
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,730
<font color="yellow">I have a rule for cutting people some slack.</font>

551
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,320
<font color="yellow">When you work, you meet all kinds of con-artist-like people.</font>

552
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,320
<font color="yellow">I first try not to let them get to me. Then if I get tricked...</font>

553
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,520
<font color="yellow">like how I get tricked by Cheol Min, I won't cut him slack.</font>

554
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,520
<font color="yellow">I'd follow him to the end...</font>

555
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,990
<font color="yellow">and make him pay for it. If he can't pay,</font>

556
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,020
<font color="yellow">I might send him to jail.</font>

557
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,460
<font color="yellow">Then why did you do that to Seo Cheol Min's sister?</font>

558
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,290
<font color="yellow">- I think she knows her place. - What do you mean?</font>

559
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,090
<font color="yellow">It looks like she knows...</font>

560
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,460
<font color="yellow">that what her brother did was embarrassing.</font>

561
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,090
<font color="yellow">She honestly accepted that her brother has made mistakes.</font>

562
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,790
<font color="yellow">I thought it was amazing to see her trying to pay for it.</font>

563
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,260
<font color="yellow">Did you think that was amazing?</font>

564
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,060
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

565
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,620
<font color="yellow">I did.</font>

566
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,190
<font color="yellow">But how much will she be able to pay back?</font>

567
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,520
<font color="yellow">I don't think there's any way for her to pay back everything.</font>

568
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,320
<font color="yellow">Isn't it enough for her to know that it was wrong?</font>

569
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,460
<font color="yellow">That's why I let her go.</font>

570
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,460
<font color="yellow">Even if Producer Kim was throwing a fit?</font>

571
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,290
<font color="yellow">- I feel bad for Producer Kim. - How about me?</font>

572
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,190
<font color="yellow">Don't you feel bad for me?</font>

573
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,520
<font color="yellow">For you...</font>

574
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,620
<font color="yellow">I feel sorry about everything.</font>

575
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,090
<font color="yellow">You're a bad guy.</font>

576
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,560
<font color="yellow">Then, marry me.</font>

577
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,590
<font color="yellow">I can't do that.</font>

578
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

579
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,190
<font color="yellow">Because I know where I stand.</font>

580
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,660
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

581
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,890
<font color="yellow">Let me ask you a question, too.</font>

582
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:30,190
<font color="yellow">Can you eat fishcake?</font>

583
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,520
<font color="yellow">How about sundae?</font>

584
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,060
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

585
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,490
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Excuse me.</font>

586
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,420
<font color="yellow">Can you give me some fishcake?</font>

587
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,090
<font color="yellow">- And bring some sundae, too. - Okay.</font>

588
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,660
<font color="yellow">You're home.</font>

589
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,960
<font color="yellow">How did Producer Kim catch you?</font>

590
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
<font color="yellow">You saw the picket I had, right?</font>

591
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,090
<font color="yellow">How can I not be spotted with something like that?</font>

592
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,090
<font color="yellow">Anyway.</font>

593
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,060
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, I must have put you in a bad spot today.</font>

594
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,660
<font color="yellow">Is that why you're sad? Because you feel embarrassed?</font>

595
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,290
<font color="yellow">No, I was thinking what I did to deserve such brother.</font>

596
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:17,460
<font color="yellow">It takes a lot to hurt my ego since I went through a lot.</font>

597
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,190
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

598
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,620
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking for the whole day,</font>

599
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,090
<font color="yellow">but I have no idea how to pay the money back.</font>

600
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,090
<font color="yellow">Exactly.</font>

601
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,160
<font color="yellow">I think I felt better when I was trying to get money out of you.</font>

602
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,320
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

603
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,290
<font color="yellow">You asked me what I was going to do for you in return.</font>

604
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,990
<font color="yellow">I was only joking.</font>

605
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,960
<font color="yellow">Put yourself in my shoes. Would you have seen it as a joke?</font>

606
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,160
<font color="yellow">It's Producer Kim. He called me 20 times today.</font>

607
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,660
<font color="yellow">Yes, Producer Kim. I'm home.</font>

608
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,360
<font color="yellow">I just got here.</font>

609
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,360
<font color="yellow">What are you saying? How can I put my grandmother on the phone?</font>

610
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,860
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you tomorrow.</font>

611
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,260
<font color="yellow">Please. I beg you.</font>

612
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,520
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

613
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,060
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow.</font>

614
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,190
<font color="yellow">Is he blackmailing you?</font>

615
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:28,720
<font color="yellow">Yes. I think a loan shark might be more suitable...</font>

616
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,890
<font color="yellow">for him than a producer.</font>

617
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,190
<font color="yellow">We can't fix what's already been done.</font>

618
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,360
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Taiwan again.</font>

619
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,460
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

620
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,990
<font color="yellow">Let's go to Taiwan to catch your brother.</font>

621
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:48,090
<font color="yellow">- That doesn't make any sense. - Why doesn't it?</font>

622
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,560
<font color="yellow">What kind of a brother tortures his family like this?</font>

623
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,260
<font color="yellow">If we catch him, everything will be solved.</font>

624
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,120
<font color="yellow">He must take responsibility of his actions, not you.</font>

625
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,890
<font color="yellow">- Do you think I want to? - Then what?</font>

626
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:05,490
<font color="yellow">I wish that either he gets caught...</font>

627
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,860
<font color="yellow">or returns quickly.</font>

628
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,360
<font color="yellow">But until then,</font>

629
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,860
<font color="yellow">I need to protect my grandmother.</font>

630
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,690
<font color="yellow">As this is what happened,</font>

631
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,960
<font color="yellow">she must have caught on a bit about Cheol Min's situation.</font>

632
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,020
<font color="yellow">Still,</font>

633
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,690
<font color="yellow">I can't let her know that the in-laws are involved.</font>

634
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,020
<font color="yellow">She's not happy to live at her in-law's house.</font>

635
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,960
<font color="yellow">Imagine if she finds out about Cheol Min and your company.</font>

636
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,320
<font color="yellow">Then she won't live here.</font>

637
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,220
<font color="yellow">It's not only a matter of place she lives.</font>

638
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,690
<font color="yellow">- It'll crush her pride. - Is it you, Dong Hui?</font>

639
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,520
<font color="yellow">- Grandmother. - What are you doing out here?</font>

640
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,460
<font color="yellow">I thought who might be mumbling out here.</font>

641
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,260
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

642
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,960
<font color="yellow">I was looking at Moong Chi.</font>

643
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,190
<font color="yellow">- Did you have dinner? - Not yet.</font>

644
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,120
<font color="yellow">Come inside and have your dinner.</font>

645
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,620
<font color="yellow">Would you want some dinner, too?</font>

646
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,890
<font color="yellow">That's okay. I'll have it downstairs.</font>

647
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,490
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

648
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,360
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

649
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,220
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim keeps trying to tell my grandmother.</font>

650
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,960
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

651
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,820
<font color="yellow">Gosh, what is she doing outside?</font>

652
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,460
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

653
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,020
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

654
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,390
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

655
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,890
<font color="yellow">You should talk if you called.</font>

656
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,790
<font color="yellow">You refused my offer to have lunch with me.</font>

657
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,590
<font color="yellow">How can she not want to know about me for two days?</font>

658
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,890
<font color="yellow">You have inferiority complex, victim mentally, and a huge ego.</font>

659
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,420
<font color="yellow">It's a good thing that I learned how to restrict the caller ID.</font>

660
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,460
<font color="yellow">But what is Jeong Eun up to? I haven't seen her the whole day.</font>

661
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,360
<font color="yellow">- What is it now? - Hey.</font>

662
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,460
<font color="yellow">- Have you seen your daughter? - Who are you referring to?</font>

663
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,620
<font color="yellow">Is Jeong Eun there? I haven't seen her the whole day.</font>

664
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,660
<font color="yellow">I'm going insane.</font>

665
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,890
<font color="yellow">How long will I be locked up here?</font>

666
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,720
<font color="yellow">Maybe she went on a trip again.</font>

667
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,420
<font color="yellow">Did you forget?</font>

668
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,890
<font color="yellow">She left three years ago without saying anything to us.</font>

669
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,090
<font color="yellow">She came home drunk the previous night.</font>

670
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,760
<font color="yellow">Then, she wasn't there the next day when we went into her room.</font>

671
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:00,860
<font color="yellow">How can you be so cold-hearted toward your own daughter?</font>

672
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,390
<font color="yellow">I'm different from Jeong Ae.</font>

673
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,020
<font color="yellow">I don't want my child to walk all over me.</font>

674
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,990
<font color="yellow">Mom, do you know what I'm doing now?</font>

675
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,390
<font color="yellow">I'm dinning alone.</font>

676
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:24,020
<font color="yellow">- I'm drinking alone. - What do you mean?</font>

677
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,760
<font color="yellow">That means I'm fine living on my own.</font>

678
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,760
<font color="yellow">Mom. So...</font>

679
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:33,090
<font color="yellow">should I go abroad...</font>

680
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,720
<font color="yellow">to study?</font>

681
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:38,520
<font color="yellow">Study abroad? See if you can get remarried or not.</font>

682
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:40,120
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

683
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,220
<font color="yellow">Get remarried? Mom!</font>

684
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,520
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

685
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:20,520
<font color="yellow">What should I do?</font>

686
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,990
<font color="yellow">I think he's here. What do I say if he asks why I'm here?</font>

687
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,190
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

688
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,520
<font color="yellow">Well, I mean...</font>

689
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,590
<font color="yellow">Let me explain this.</font>

690
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:12,890
<font color="yellow">Why are you here?</font>

691
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,820
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here?</font>

692
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,320
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

693
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,060
<font color="yellow">Let me explain. I just...</font>

694
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,790
<font color="yellow">How did you get in here? Who let you in?</font>

695
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,090
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

696
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,560
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die?</font>

697
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:33,790
<font color="yellow">Is this the police?</font>

698
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,060
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

699
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,590
<font color="yellow">Let's talk at the police station.</font>

700
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,990
<font color="yellow">Look, David. Do you really have to do this?</font>

701
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,790
<font color="yellow">We're neighbors, and we went through some stuff in New York.</font>

702
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,090
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me?</font>

703
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,890
<font color="yellow">David.</font>

704
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,590
<font color="yellow">You'll pay for this, okay?</font>

705
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:59,220
<font color="yellow">Let's talk at the police station.</font>

706
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,390
<font color="yellow">- You brat! - Gosh.</font>

707
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:34,620
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I can't put my head up in the neighborhood because of you.</font>

708
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,820
<font color="yellow">How could you be taken to the police station right after coming back?</font>

709
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,890
<font color="yellow">You just came back!</font>

710
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,820
<font color="yellow">This is unfair. I'm innocent.</font>

711
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,090
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me right now?</font>

712
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,490
<font color="yellow">Gosh. All you ever do is causing troubles.</font>

713
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,890
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

714
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,290
<font color="yellow">Gosh. I can't believe you.</font>

715
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,190
<font color="yellow">I've always been ashamed that you're my daughter.</font>

716
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,760
<font color="yellow">This is so embarrassing. Let's go.</font>

717
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,420
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

718
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,190
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

719
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,160
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell what it is?</font>

720
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,220
<font color="yellow">Read the electric, gas,</font>

721
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,420
<font color="yellow">and water meter at the kids' house every month.</font>

722
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,360
<font color="yellow">Write down the number there,</font>

723
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:31,520
<font color="yellow">and collect the charges from them.</font>

724
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,890
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

725
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,120
<font color="yellow">I told them to transfer the rent to my bank account.</font>

726
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,720
<font color="yellow">So you should take care of that.</font>

727
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,290
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to do this to the kids?</font>

728
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,660
<font color="yellow">Of course.</font>

729
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,420
<font color="yellow">Are you going to pay for that instead?</font>

730
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,990
<font color="yellow">You know we don't have any money to spare.</font>

731
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,760
<font color="yellow">But we're their parents.</font>

732
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,320
<font color="yellow">How can I ask them for these charges?</font>

733
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:54,420
<font color="yellow">It's not like they're paying us voluntarily.</font>

734
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,890
<font color="yellow">If you don't want to do it, give it to me. I'll do it.</font>

735
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,020
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

736
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,960
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll do it.</font>

737
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,190
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you.</font>

738
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,520
<font color="yellow">You're such a dreadful person.</font>

739
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:16,060
<font color="yellow">I called you because you didn't come out to jog this morning.</font>

740
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:18,160
<font color="yellow">I had an early shooting.</font>

741
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:20,620
<font color="yellow">That's why.</font>

742
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:23,560
<font color="yellow">I didn't know. I waited for two hours.</font>

743
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,320
<font color="yellow">Yoo Ra. Why don't we have dinner together?</font>

744
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,020
<font color="yellow">Why are you calling my first name in all of a sudden?</font>

745
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,620
<font color="yellow">It's not a sudden.</font>

746
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,420
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to be friends with you.</font>

747
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,660
<font color="yellow">Yoo Ra. I'll come and pick you up at the broadcasting station.</font>

748
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,790
<font color="yellow">How does that sound?</font>

749
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,490
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's just one dinner. Why are you so...</font>

750
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:49,990
<font color="yellow">I'll call you back.</font>

751
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,020
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

752
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,390
<font color="yellow">When did you get in here?</font>

753
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,090
<font color="yellow">A while ago. I had to use the toilet.</font>

754
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,890
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

755
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,290
<font color="yellow">By the way, who is Yoo Ra?</font>

756
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,820
<font color="yellow">I have a friend named Yoo Ra, too.</font>

757
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,860
<font color="yellow">You must not tell anyone about this, okay?</font>

758
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,090
<font color="yellow">No. I'll go and tell my dad.</font>

759
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,890
<font color="yellow">Ah In. Wait. Please don't say anything.</font>

760
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,360
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

761
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,420
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it hurts.</font>

762
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,660
<font color="yellow">Don't be such a baby.</font>

763
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,420
<font color="yellow">Tell me how you hurt your back.</font>

764
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,220
<font color="yellow">It just happened.</font>

765
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,760
<font color="yellow">Everything you do upsets me.</font>

766
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,820
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Get ready to go to preschool.</font>

767
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,890
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

768
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,890
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

769
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,590
<font color="yellow">Yes, Ah In. What is it?</font>

770
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,960
<font color="yellow">I saw Uncle...</font>

771
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,720
<font color="yellow">talking to my friend Yoo Ra on the phone.</font>

772
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:03,590
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

773
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,660
<font color="yellow">It's a secret.</font>

774
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,120
<font color="yellow">What is this? Why can't you answer me?</font>

775
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,820
<font color="yellow">What's going on this time?</font>

776
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,460
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

777
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,220
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

778
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,390
<font color="yellow">do this badly on the test?</font>

779
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,820
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

780
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,420
<font color="yellow">you tried to hide it.</font>

781
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,190
<font color="yellow">How dare you lie to me?</font>

782
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,260
<font color="yellow">How could you? You little brat!</font>

783
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,460
<font color="yellow">You're the third place. How can you be the third place?</font>

784
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,660
<font color="yellow">How could you drop to the third place in a month?</font>

785
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,660
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you did this!</font>

786
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:48,160
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Please don't hit Ji Hoon.</font>

787
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,390
<font color="yellow">Don't hit him.</font>

788
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,320
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let go of me.</font>

789
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,590
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

790
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:56,260
<font color="yellow">Hit me instead. I'm fat, so it won't hurt that much.</font>

791
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,120
<font color="yellow">Get off of me!</font>

792
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,820
<font color="yellow">Go upstairs. I think Hee Sook is tormenting Ji Hoon again.</font>

793
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:09,220
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I can't believe that woman.</font>

794
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,720
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm living like this?</font>

795
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,220
<font color="yellow">I moved in here...</font>

796
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,360
<font color="yellow">and I'm taking care of your grandparents.</font>

797
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,860
<font color="yellow">Why do you think I'm doing this?</font>

798
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,520
<font color="yellow">How could you do this badly on the test?</font>

799
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,120
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

800
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:26,290
<font color="yellow">you lied to me about it. How could?</font>

801
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,690
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

802
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,520
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

803
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,790
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

804
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,720
<font color="yellow">I'll report you to the police for abusing your child.</font>

805
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,190
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - I'll report you to the police.</font>

806
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,790
<font color="yellow">Look. Getting good grades doesn't make him happy.</font>

807
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,620
<font color="yellow">Getting into a good college won't make him successful.</font>

808
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:51,160
<font color="yellow">I said this is none of your business.</font>

809
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,560
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Let go of me.</font>

810
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:58,990
<font color="yellow">Frankly, you graduated from a local college.</font>

811
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,120
<font color="yellow">Even though you did,</font>

812
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:04,220
<font color="yellow">you're now living in a 150m² house,</font>

813
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,190
<font color="yellow">and having a nice life.</font>

814
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,990
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon got the third place and it means he did really good.</font>

815
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,090
<font color="yellow">Why can't you just leave him alone?</font>

816
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:13,890
<font color="yellow">I just don't understand you.</font>

817
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,760
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

818
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,390
<font color="yellow">What did you...</font>

819
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:27,360
<font color="yellow">just say?</font>

820
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:28,860
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

821
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,960
<font color="yellow">I said leave Ji Hoon alone.</font>

822
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,260
<font color="yellow">Getting good grades doesn't make him happy.</font>

823
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:34,660
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

824
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,990
<font color="yellow">The kids were here.</font>

825
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:39,660
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

826
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,520
<font color="yellow">dredge up my past like that?</font>

827
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:44,520
<font color="yellow">How...</font>

828
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,460
<font color="yellow">How could you...</font>

829
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:49,860
<font color="yellow">tell them that I graduated from a local college?</font>

830
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,420
<font color="yellow">How could you?</font>

831
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,520
<font color="yellow">Calm down, Ji Hoon.</font>

832
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,760
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! My mom is a witch.</font>

833
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:06,120
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Ji Hoon.</font>

834
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,160
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

835
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,290
<font color="yellow">I like the material.</font>

836
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,620
<font color="yellow">The material is okay.</font>

837
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:30,760
<font color="yellow">It fits nicely as well.</font>

838
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,390
<font color="yellow">The jacket looks much nicer...</font>

839
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:34,960
<font color="yellow">since you're the one who's wearing it.</font>

840
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,360
<font color="yellow">You look great.</font>

841
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,120
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

842
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,260
<font color="yellow">All you need to do is set a reasonable price. Push it through.</font>

843
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,860
<font color="yellow">Okay, Ms. Bang.</font>

844
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:46,620
<font color="yellow">Please go ahead. I want to jog for a while longer.</font>

845
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,220
<font color="yellow">Okay, Ms. Bang. Have a good jog.</font>

846
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,560
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm exhausted.</font>

847
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,620
<font color="yellow">Good morning. I missed your call.</font>

848
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:10,060
<font color="yellow">Yes. Where are you? You weren't in your office.</font>

849
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,490
<font color="yellow">Did you want to see me?</font>

850
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,890
<font color="yellow">Yes. I need your authorization on something.</font>

851
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,260
<font color="yellow">Do you have to speak that way?</font>

852
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,320
<font color="yellow">Instead of that, you can say you need to consult or discuss...</font>

853
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,490
<font color="yellow">something with me.</font>

854
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,720
<font color="yellow">It means the same thing.</font>

855
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:24,790
<font color="yellow">Is that why you told me that...</font>

856
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,390
<font color="yellow">you know your place?</font>

857
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:31,490
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking about what you said to me since last night.</font>

858
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,560
<font color="yellow">I'm a bit disappointed, but I don't feel bad about it.</font>

859
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,990
<font color="yellow">I'm disappointed because there is still a wall...</font>

860
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,820
<font color="yellow">between you and me.</font>

861
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,820
<font color="yellow">I don't feel bad because it means...</font>

862
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,560
<font color="yellow">you're still attracted to me on some level.</font>

863
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - I'll try harder.</font>

864
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,490
<font color="yellow">I have new hopes.</font>

865
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:52,590
<font color="yellow">- I still need your authorization. - Let's have lunch together.</font>

866
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,490
<font color="yellow">How about sundae soup? I'll see you later.</font>

867
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,760
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo.</font>

868
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,320
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Director Han. - Hello.</font>

869
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,760
<font color="yellow">There's something I should tell you.</font>

870
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,290
<font color="yellow">Please come.</font>

871
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:29,390
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

872
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:47,120
<font color="yellow">Everyone. Let me introduce you our new employee.</font>

873
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,060
<font color="yellow">Her name is Oh Dong Hui.</font>

874
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,490
<font color="yellow">Hello. I'm Oh Dong Hui.</font>

875
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,890
<font color="yellow">I look forward to working with you.</font>

876
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,260
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to take a bath?</font>

877
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:15,520
<font color="yellow">If you want to stay in this house, get rid of that shabby clothes,</font>

878
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,390
<font color="yellow">and get washed up.</font>

879
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:23,790
<font color="yellow">Are you hearing me or not?</font>

880
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,890
<font color="yellow">Take off these shabby clothes!</font>

881
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,460
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your hair? Also, what about your clothes?</font>

882
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:36,060
<font color="yellow">- And why are you wearing this? - Don't touch it.</font>

883
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,720
<font color="yellow">Dad gave this to me.</font>

884
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,420
<font color="yellow">What... What did you say?</font>

885
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,460
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

886
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,590
<font color="yellow">Dad gave this to me.</font>

887
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,390
<font color="yellow">I met him in 30 years and he gave this to me.</font>

888
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,520
<font color="yellow">I met Dad in Spain.</font>

889
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,720
<font color="yellow">I went on a trip to meet Dad.</font>

890
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,460
<font color="yellow">That's why I wondered around the world!</font>

891
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,990
<font color="yellow">But that jerk wouldn't...</font>

892
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,820
<font color="yellow">return this necklace.</font>

893
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:12,290
<font color="yellow">I had to have this, so I can come to see you. But he wouldn't return it.</font>

894
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,720
<font color="yellow">That's why I went to his place. You don't know anything.</font>

895
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:59,460
<font color="yellow">Hey. You shouldn't do that. We'll get in trouble.</font>

896
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:03,160
<font color="yellow">- Really? - You brats. What are you doing?</font>

897
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,190
<font color="yellow">- Let's go. - Stop, you punks!</font>

898
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,860
<font color="yellow">Look. Dad made us cucumber sandwiches.</font>

899
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,020
<font color="yellow">It looks delicious.</font>

900
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,590
<font color="yellow">I'll go inside and eat it with milk.</font>

901
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,290
<font color="yellow">- Hyun Woo. - Don't look, Sang Woo.</font>

902
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,120
<font color="yellow">Hyun Woo. What's wrong with Dad?</font>

903
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,990
<font color="yellow">- Let me see. - No.</font>

904
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,990
<font color="yellow">You can't see it.</font>

905
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,320
<font color="yellow">Don't look, Sang Woo.</font>

906
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:47,760
<font color="yellow">It's 3, 5,</font>

907
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:50,120
<font color="yellow">and six...</font>

908
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,090
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

909
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,060
<font color="yellow">How can she ask her children...</font>

910
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,290
<font color="yellow">to pay something like this? She's a terrible person.</font>

911
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,790
<font color="yellow">So, it's 6, 3, and...</font>

912
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,220
<font color="yellow">Gosh. You're from the house across the street.</font>

913
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,360
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

914
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,460
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

915
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:08,890
<font color="yellow">I hope we get along, Director Han.</font>

916
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,290
<font color="yellow">You're unstoppable, Dong Hui.</font>

917
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,620
<font color="yellow">You already caused us trouble.</font>

918
01:06:12,660 --> 01:06:14,890
