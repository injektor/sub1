2
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:17,824
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

3
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,394
<font color="yellow">Did you just hit me?</font>

4
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,764
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have touched me.</font>

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:24,964
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I touched you?</font>

6
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:26,924
<font color="yellow">I was sleeping here and...</font>

7
00:00:26,964 --> 00:00:29,624
<font color="yellow">you kicked, hugged, and touched me.</font>

8
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:30,794
<font color="yellow">What are you saying?</font>

9
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,664
<font color="yellow">It's because you were sleeping here.</font>

10
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:35,264
<font color="yellow">That doesn't justify the fact that you touched me.</font>

11
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:38,224
<font color="yellow">I'm not your girlfriend, am I?</font>

12
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,864
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were a woman.</font>

13
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,224
<font color="yellow">Besides, what kind of a woman sleeps in a construction site?</font>

14
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:47,264
<font color="yellow">This is what I've been doing for the last three years all over the world.</font>

15
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:50,594
<font color="yellow">And I've encountered men like you.</font>

16
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,724
<font color="yellow">They pretended to be nice and helpful...</font>

17
00:00:54,094 --> 00:00:56,194
<font color="yellow">but all they wanted to do was just touching my body and all.</font>

18
00:00:56,324 --> 00:00:57,494
<font color="yellow">What? Touch your body?</font>

19
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,464
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - Don't come near me.</font>

20
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:03,964
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me. I might kill you.</font>

21
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,424
<font color="yellow">I've caught perverts like you in...</font>

22
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,794
<font color="yellow">London, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Hague...</font>

23
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:13,164
<font color="yellow">Rio de Janeiro, and Ushuaia.</font>

24
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:16,494
<font color="yellow">I've caught so many perverts like you.</font>

25
00:01:16,764 --> 00:01:18,124
<font color="yellow">Did you just say Ushuaia?</font>

26
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:21,094
<font color="yellow">It's a city, located in the southernmost of Argentina.</font>

27
00:01:21,464 --> 00:01:23,394
<font color="yellow">If you go further, you'll see Antarctica, too.</font>

28
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:25,264
<font color="yellow">It's the place where Yang Jo Wi said...</font>

29
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:27,864
<font color="yellow">we can throw out our sadness in a movie called "Happy Together."</font>

30
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,924
<font color="yellow">Don't come near me. Don't.</font>

31
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,124
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

32
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:35,894
<font color="yellow">Seriously...</font>

33
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:37,094
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

34
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:39,394
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you do for a living.</font>

35
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:42,294
<font color="yellow">But get out of here right now.</font>

36
00:01:47,164 --> 00:01:49,094
<font color="yellow">I'm speechless.</font>

37
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,394
<font color="yellow">You are getting on my nerves with the way you're talking to me.</font>

38
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:54,324
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

39
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:55,964
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

40
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,324
<font color="yellow">What do you think I do for a living?</font>

41
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,224
<font color="yellow">How on earth would I know?</font>

42
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:03,894
<font color="yellow">Besides, if you can sleep at a place like this,</font>

43
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:06,124
<font color="yellow">you should know what I meant.</font>

44
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,394
<font color="yellow">Don't you think so?</font>

45
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:12,164
<font color="yellow">Then how about you? What do you do for a living?</font>

46
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,224
<font color="yellow">I'm in charge of this construction site.</font>

47
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:15,764
<font color="yellow">Is that enough?</font>

48
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,224
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

49
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,024
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

50
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,494
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

51
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:27,694
<font color="yellow">Do you understand now?</font>

52
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:32,694
<font color="yellow">If you did,</font>

53
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:34,364
<font color="yellow">please get out.</font>

54
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:40,024
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

55
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,764
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

56
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,724
<font color="yellow">If you are in charge...</font>

57
00:02:48,524 --> 00:02:52,524
<font color="yellow">could you just let me sleep here? It's too cold outside.</font>

58
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:55,564
<font color="yellow">This is the warmest place.</font>

59
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,264
<font color="yellow">Just for a night.</font>

60
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:00,964
<font color="yellow">I'll sleep here just tonight.</font>

61
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:04,294
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure to clean up afterwards.</font>

62
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,994
<font color="yellow">Come on. Please let me stay here for tonight.</font>

63
00:03:07,064 --> 00:03:08,794
<font color="yellow">Please...</font>

64
00:03:16,624 --> 00:03:18,794
<font color="yellow">Are you kidding me?</font>

65
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:21,964
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

66
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:25,994
<font color="yellow">It's not like the floor is going to worn out. You can let me stay.</font>

67
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:30,424
<font color="yellow">It's just that I have nowhere to stay tonight.</font>

68
00:03:30,524 --> 00:03:31,624
<font color="yellow">You're out of control.</font>

69
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:33,894
<font color="yellow">I have to call the police.</font>

70
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,394
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will leave.</font>

71
00:03:40,964 --> 00:03:42,494
<font color="yellow">I am leaving!</font>

72
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,364
<font color="yellow">Let's be honest. You might be the construction manager here,</font>

73
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:57,124
<font color="yellow">but this building is not yours.</font>

74
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:59,224
<font color="yellow">People are often mistaken.</font>

75
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:00,924
<font color="yellow">They think they own the building when they build it...</font>

76
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:02,494
<font color="yellow">even if there is an actual owner.</font>

77
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:06,364
<font color="yellow">You might be on your high horse for being the construction manager,</font>

78
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:07,494
<font color="yellow">but who knows?</font>

79
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:10,664
<font color="yellow">You can be as miserable as me when the construction is over.</font>

80
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:13,624
<font color="yellow">So what's wrong with helping each other at times of hardship?</font>

81
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:15,124
<font color="yellow">I'm counting three.</font>

82
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:16,724
<font color="yellow">One.</font>

83
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,164
<font color="yellow">As you wish. Two.</font>

84
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,764
<font color="yellow">- Three! - No!</font>

85
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:33,494
<font color="yellow">Good luck with the rest of your life, you merciless man.</font>

86
00:04:33,694 --> 00:04:37,124
<font color="yellow">Nothing will work out in your life if you treat people like this.</font>

87
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:40,464
<font color="yellow">You will get ill for no reason. Every friend will betray you.</font>

88
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:42,124
<font color="yellow">Also, every woman you date will run away from you.</font>

89
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,324
<font color="yellow">You will wander around these construction sites...</font>

90
00:04:44,324 --> 00:04:46,224
<font color="yellow">for the rest of your life and in the end, you'll die alone...</font>

91
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,764
<font color="yellow">at a place like this. Then you will lie down...</font>

92
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,694
<font color="yellow">and regret about today so badly.</font>

93
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:58,564
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey!</font>

94
00:04:58,794 --> 00:05:00,464
<font color="yellow">Stop there.</font>

95
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,964
<font color="yellow">Hey! Hey! Stop there!</font>

96
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,064
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

97
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:05,964
<font color="yellow">There's soup.</font>

98
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,724
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mr. Kim.</font>

99
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:27,064
<font color="yellow">No, I am up.</font>

100
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:30,324
<font color="yellow">Hurry and get ready.</font>

101
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:35,124
<font color="yellow">Yes. What's up at this early hour?</font>

102
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,164
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

103
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:41,964
<font color="yellow">No. I can go now.</font>

104
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:43,964
<font color="yellow">Yes. Where should I go?</font>

105
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:45,724
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

106
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:49,294
<font color="yellow">I will get ready right away and call you when I am there.</font>

107
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:51,194
<font color="yellow">Yes. Okay.</font>

108
00:06:52,424 --> 00:06:53,864
<font color="yellow">Kids, get ready fast.</font>

109
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:57,024
<font color="yellow">By the way, where did your mom go?</font>

110
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:09,294
<font color="yellow">Where is the soy sauce?</font>

111
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:16,924
<font color="yellow">Mother, where is the soy sauce?</font>

112
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:25,024
<font color="yellow">Father.</font>

113
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,064
<font color="yellow">What are you doing here at this early hour?</font>

114
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,224
<font color="yellow">I came up to make you breakfast.</font>

115
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,864
<font color="yellow">You don't have to bother yourself with that.</font>

116
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,924
<font color="yellow">You can't do this. It's going to make things difficult for everyone.</font>

117
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,264
<font color="yellow">Where's your mother?</font>

118
00:07:37,194 --> 00:07:39,894
<font color="yellow">- She is not here. - Did she go somewhere?</font>

119
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:43,594
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it's good that you're here. Please take a seat.</font>

120
00:07:50,124 --> 00:07:53,024
<font color="yellow">Where is your grandmother now?</font>

121
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:56,224
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon said...</font>

122
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:59,364
<font color="yellow">she's staying at a sauna. Is that true?</font>

123
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,094
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

124
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:05,464
<font color="yellow">My goodness. What do we do?</font>

125
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:09,724
<font color="yellow">Father, you don't need to worry.</font>

126
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:13,694
<font color="yellow">- I'll handle it today. - How will you do that?</font>

127
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,794
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't have to move in here if you could handle that.</font>

128
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:23,264
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon shouldn't have quit his job at the newspaper company.</font>

129
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:25,494
<font color="yellow">Why did he have to start a business...</font>

130
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:28,324
<font color="yellow">and make your grandmother lose her house and her shop?</font>

131
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:31,534
<font color="yellow">I am too ashamed to see your grandmother.</font>

132
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:33,794
<font color="yellow">Is that what he told you?</font>

133
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:36,224
<font color="yellow">He said he was going to start a business with your brother.</font>

134
00:08:36,794 --> 00:08:39,064
<font color="yellow">Yes, but Father,</font>

135
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:41,494
<font color="yellow">my little brother must feel guiltier.</font>

136
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,324
<font color="yellow">What kind of a business were they trying to do?</font>

137
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:48,664
<font color="yellow">They said they were going to raise penguins and...</font>

138
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,894
<font color="yellow">sell them to Africa.</font>

139
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,664
<font color="yellow">What an idiot.</font>

140
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:57,324
<font color="yellow">How can he sell penguins to Africa?</font>

141
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,294
<font color="yellow">By the way, Father,</font>

142
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:02,534
<font color="yellow">my little brother took the lead.</font>

143
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:05,064
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon just put his stamp on it.</font>

144
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:08,664
<font color="yellow">- Mother shouldn't find this out. - I know.</font>

145
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:12,864
<font color="yellow">No matter what he did, they decided to do it together.</font>

146
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:16,724
<font color="yellow">That's why your grandmother lost everything, like her house and shop.</font>

147
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:20,664
<font color="yellow">Yes. If you think like that, that's a way to put it.</font>

148
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,924
<font color="yellow">There's only one solution.</font>

149
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:25,294
<font color="yellow">Until you two get back on your feet...</font>

150
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:29,594
<font color="yellow">and manage to afford her, she'll have to stay here with us.</font>

151
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:30,794
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

152
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:33,194
<font color="yellow">That's impossible, Father.</font>

153
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,534
<font color="yellow">Where would she stay here?</font>

154
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:39,124
<font color="yellow">It's a little shabby, but how about the rooftop room?</font>

155
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:41,864
<font color="yellow">The rooftop room?</font>

156
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:55,294
<font color="yellow">Eat up. Why are you picking at the food?</font>

157
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:59,264
<font color="yellow">You have to eat good breakfast to be sharp at school.</font>

158
00:09:59,994 --> 00:10:01,194
<font color="yellow">I am eating.</font>

159
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,264
<font color="yellow">Which private lessons do you have after school?</font>

160
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,564
<font color="yellow">I have all three major lessons today.</font>

161
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:09,424
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

162
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:12,224
<font color="yellow">Then I will pick you up tonight.</font>

163
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:14,794
<font color="yellow">Meet me where I always wait for you, okay?</font>

164
00:10:15,594 --> 00:10:16,594
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

165
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,864
<font color="yellow">Honey, try to eat everything.</font>

166
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:26,324
<font color="yellow">You have to maintain your health for today's schedule.</font>

167
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:30,264
<font color="yellow">- You frustrate me. - Aunt.</font>

168
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,332
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

169
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,792
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

170
00:10:41,992 --> 00:10:43,792
<font color="yellow">Can we eat, too?</font>

171
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,562
<font color="yellow">Where is your mother?</font>

172
00:10:54,902 --> 00:10:58,632
<font color="yellow">We don't know where she is.</font>

173
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:00,292
<font color="yellow">We have to go to school,</font>

174
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:04,832
<font color="yellow">and we need breakfast. That's why we came here.</font>

175
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:23,462
<font color="yellow">Hey, eat slowly.</font>

176
00:11:24,232 --> 00:11:26,732
<font color="yellow">Okay. This is my normal speed.</font>

177
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:30,262
<font color="yellow">Kids.</font>

178
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,562
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

179
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:35,332
<font color="yellow">Let's tie your hair and go to preschool.</font>

180
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:41,762
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, where did you go...</font>

181
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:45,362
<font color="yellow">without preparing breakfast for your children?</font>

182
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,732
<font color="yellow">- Are you all packed? - Yes.</font>

183
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,592
<font color="yellow">Mom has to go to work.</font>

184
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:52,962
<font color="yellow">- So Dad will drop you, okay? - Okay.</font>

185
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,262
<font color="yellow">I am leaving.</font>

186
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,332
<font color="yellow">What? You have to drop Ah In.</font>

187
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,662
<font color="yellow">Where are you going? It's her first day.</font>

188
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:02,062
<font color="yellow">Mr. Kim wants to see me. I'm leaving.</font>

189
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:05,492
<font color="yellow">Honey, I have to go to work, too!</font>

190
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,392
<font color="yellow">The soup is nice.</font>

191
00:12:25,762 --> 00:12:26,992
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

192
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:29,932
<font color="yellow">Why would they bother us at this early hour?</font>

193
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,562
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it.</font>

194
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:33,932
<font color="yellow">We're late. Hurry up.</font>

195
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,292
<font color="yellow">Goodness!</font>

196
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:46,492
<font color="yellow">- What do you want now? - Aunt.</font>

197
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:48,962
<font color="yellow">Can you give me a ride, too?</font>

198
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,192
<font color="yellow">We go to the same school, and we're in the same class, too.</font>

199
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,232
<font color="yellow">- Chang Soo. - Yes?</font>

200
00:13:06,262 --> 00:13:08,832
<font color="yellow">- Please turn that game off. - I'm almost done.</font>

201
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:11,892
<font color="yellow">Stop playing when I tell you to.</font>

202
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:14,462
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon is studying. - Okay.</font>

203
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:17,762
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop.</font>

204
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:21,032
<font color="yellow">It's distracting me from my driving as well.</font>

205
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,132
<font color="yellow">Okay, I'll turn it off soon.</font>

206
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,092
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

207
00:13:37,132 --> 00:13:38,192
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

208
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,062
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

209
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,762
<font color="yellow">Didn't I tell you to stop or not?</font>

210
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:46,262
<font color="yellow">I'm almost done. I'll turn it off soon.</font>

211
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:49,062
<font color="yellow">What a brat. Get out of the car.</font>

212
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:58,432
<font color="yellow">Get out.</font>

213
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,592
<font color="yellow">I told you to stop playing, right?</font>

214
00:14:05,592 --> 00:14:07,392
<font color="yellow">You should have stopped when I told you to.</font>

215
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:09,432
<font color="yellow">Don't you see Ji Hoon's studying next to you?</font>

216
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:12,862
<font color="yellow">How could your mother buy you a smartphone?</font>

217
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:16,062
<font color="yellow">And how could she let you play games like this?</font>

218
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,662
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

219
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:23,192
<font color="yellow">I won't play it again. Can I have it back?</font>

220
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:24,962
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

221
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,362
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep your phone for today.</font>

222
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:32,962
<font color="yellow">Please, Aunt.</font>

223
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:36,362
<font color="yellow">Please what? Just get into the car. Get in.</font>

224
00:14:36,362 --> 00:14:37,662
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

225
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,492
<font color="yellow">I beg you, Aunt.</font>

226
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,432
<font color="yellow">Please don't do this, Aunt.</font>

227
00:14:46,432 --> 00:14:49,332
<font color="yellow">You better sit back and be quiet.</font>

228
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,362
<font color="yellow">Please, Aunt.</font>

229
00:15:19,932 --> 00:15:21,092
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

230
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:29,992
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, bring me my suit. I'm filming a show today.</font>

231
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,792
<font color="yellow">My goodness. Gosh.</font>

232
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:36,092
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

233
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,432
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

234
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,132
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

235
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,292
<font color="yellow">I'm done. Let's go, Ah In.</font>

236
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:43,532
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in my house?</font>

237
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:50,332
<font color="yellow">This isn't polite! What are you doing in my house at this hour?</font>

238
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:54,192
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

239
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,192
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

240
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:01,062
<font color="yellow">It feels like it's my house, it seems like it's my house, but not</font>

241
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:02,862
<font color="yellow">Is it something like this?</font>

242
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:06,292
<font color="yellow">They must have seen me naked.</font>

243
00:16:12,892 --> 00:16:15,662
<font color="yellow">Father, Seong Hoon went somewhere.</font>

244
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:17,532
<font color="yellow">Okay, I understand.</font>

245
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:20,962
<font color="yellow">Consider what I said previously.</font>

246
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:22,862
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

247
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:24,992
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

248
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,932
<font color="yellow">Shall we play together?</font>

249
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:31,132
<font color="yellow">- Have a good day. - Thank you.</font>

250
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:08,992
<font color="yellow">What brings my eldest granddaughter-in-law here?</font>

251
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,602
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well last night?</font>

252
00:17:10,602 --> 00:17:12,292
<font color="yellow">Of course, I did. How about you?</font>

253
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,662
<font color="yellow">I did, too.</font>

254
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,192
<font color="yellow">Is Jeong Ae still angry?</font>

255
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,162
<font color="yellow">She wasn't in her room.</font>

256
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:20,602
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

257
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:22,192
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

258
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,862
<font color="yellow">I should get to work now.</font>

259
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,462
<font color="yellow">Okay. Have a good day at work. By the way,</font>

260
00:17:28,462 --> 00:17:31,892
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about Jeong Ae. Forget about her, okay?</font>

261
00:17:36,762 --> 00:17:39,732
<font color="yellow">Everyone's leaving in the morning just like the tide goes out.</font>

262
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:43,262
<font color="yellow">That means it'll be empty during the afternoon.</font>

263
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:46,132
<font color="yellow">And it's crowded at night. Jeong Ae should let it go.</font>

264
00:17:46,792 --> 00:17:47,832
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

265
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:49,792
<font color="yellow">Did she leave because she's angry?</font>

266
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:00,262
<font color="yellow">The card is functioning.</font>

267
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:48,862
<font color="yellow">Excuse me. I'm here to see Han Seong Joon.</font>

268
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:53,892
<font color="yellow">Do you mean the director of Contents Marketing Department?</font>

269
00:18:54,892 --> 00:18:55,992
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

270
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:59,432
<font color="yellow">Let's move the chair to that side. It's in the way.</font>

271
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:00,562
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

272
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:03,162
<font color="yellow">Please arrange the plants, too.</font>

273
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,762
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

274
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,732
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim, is that the best you can do?</font>

275
00:19:06,732 --> 00:19:09,292
<font color="yellow">Should I put this flower on the desk?</font>

276
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,102
<font color="yellow">Let's place it here for now.</font>

277
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:14,962
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

278
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:17,392
<font color="yellow">Someone is here to see Han Seong Joon.</font>

279
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:18,892
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

280
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,432
<font color="yellow">A woman came to visit him.</font>

281
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:40,332
<font color="yellow">Are you here to meet Director Han?</font>

282
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:42,602
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's right.</font>

283
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,232
<font color="yellow">I came to return his bag.</font>

284
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,432
<font color="yellow">Would you like something to drink?</font>

285
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:10,492
<font color="yellow">I brought you here because I need to go for a meeting soon.</font>

286
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,102
<font color="yellow">Are you okay with it?</font>

287
00:20:12,432 --> 00:20:13,532
<font color="yellow">Yes, I'm fine.</font>

288
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,862
<font color="yellow">I'm a colleague and a friend of Director Han.</font>

289
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,362
<font color="yellow">May I ask your name if you don't mind?</font>

290
00:20:19,602 --> 00:20:21,192
<font color="yellow">It's Oh Dong Hui.</font>

291
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:22,602
<font color="yellow">I see. Ms. Oh Dong Hui.</font>

292
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:26,492
<font color="yellow">How did you have his bag?</font>

293
00:20:27,832 --> 00:20:28,892
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

294
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:30,762
<font color="yellow">The truth is...</font>

295
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:33,602
<font color="yellow">we met coincidentally in Taiwan.</font>

296
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,762
<font color="yellow">I dropped my passport and...</font>

297
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,762
<font color="yellow">Director Han picked it up.</font>

298
00:20:40,102 --> 00:20:42,362
<font color="yellow">Then he lost his bag.</font>

299
00:20:42,932 --> 00:20:44,562
<font color="yellow">So I lost my passport again...</font>

300
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:47,192
<font color="yellow">and he helped me register for my new passport.</font>

301
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:50,732
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

302
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,102
<font color="yellow">I guess someone found the bag in Taiwan.</font>

303
00:20:53,102 --> 00:20:55,032
<font color="yellow">The tour agency contacted me.</font>

304
00:20:55,492 --> 00:20:57,132
<font color="yellow">So I came here to return it.</font>

305
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:00,492
<font color="yellow">A lot of things happened in Taiwan.</font>

306
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,262
<font color="yellow">Yes, a lot of things did happen.</font>

307
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:08,102
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you for bringing it back personally.</font>

308
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:09,892
<font color="yellow">I'll pass it on to him.</font>

309
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:12,762
<font color="yellow">Director.</font>

310
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,632
<font color="yellow">Please, take this.</font>

311
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,462
<font color="yellow">This is to show our gratitude.</font>

312
00:21:21,232 --> 00:21:22,792
<font color="yellow">It's not necessary.</font>

313
00:21:22,862 --> 00:21:26,602
<font color="yellow">Please, accept it. You came all the way here to deliver the bag.</font>

314
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:28,892
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

315

319

321

<font color="yellow">Do you want to refund?</font>

323

<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

324
00:22:21,332 --> 00:22:24,762
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to get a refund? You really wanted to try it.</font>

325
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:26,632
<font color="yellow">You told me it was one of your wishes.</font>

326

327

329
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:41,892
<font color="yellow">And I think the heels are too high.</font>

<font color="yellow">It won't be...</font>

331
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:45,862
<font color="yellow">good for my knees.</font>

335
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:59,562

336
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:02,162

<font color="yellow">Yes, please.</font>

340
00:23:07,592 --> 00:23:10,662

341

345
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:34,632
<font color="yellow">- I am. - Then, start.</font>

346
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:38,492
<font color="yellow">My back hurts.</font>

347
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:44,392
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. You have dust all over your back.</font>

348
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,532
<font color="yellow">- Do you want one more ride? - Yes.</font>

349

<font color="yellow">Let's go home.</font>

350
00:23:55,332 --> 00:23:57,292
<font color="yellow">Now, I'll show you flowers.</font>

351
00:23:57,662 --> 00:24:00,892
<font color="yellow">If you see flowers, the time will fly. Hello, Mom.</font>

352
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,832
<font color="yellow">- Are you babysitting today? - Yes.</font>

353
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:08,392
<font color="yellow">- Grandma. - My dear cute girl.</font>

354
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:12,062
<font color="yellow">Here's my little cute pumpkin.</font>

355
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,892
<font color="yellow">Don't bother my son, okay?</font>

356
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:18,132

357

359
00:24:29,732 --> 00:24:30,932
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

360
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:34,392
<font color="yellow">What? Elizabeth is?</font>

361
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,062
<font color="yellow">- Elizabeth? - No, it's nothing.</font>

362
00:24:37,362 --> 00:24:38,462
<font color="yellow">So Elizabeth is...</font>

363
00:24:39,162 --> 00:24:42,432
<font color="yellow">So is Hye Joo's grandmother staying in the sauna?</font>

364
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:43,832
<font color="yellow">That's what I heard.</font>

365
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:46,662
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon was a good kid when he was young,</font>

366
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:50,232
<font color="yellow">but why is he making such big troubles in series in his 40s?</font>

367
00:24:50,462 --> 00:24:51,732
<font color="yellow">That's what I'm saying.</font>

368
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,792
<font color="yellow">I feel so bad for Hye Joo's grandmother.</font>

369
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:58,962
<font color="yellow">By the way, I don't know if this place fits for living.</font>

370
00:24:59,492 --> 00:25:02,462
<font color="yellow">- Goodness! - This is driving me crazy.</font>

371
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:06,132
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone interrupting my sleep?</font>

372
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,632
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

373
00:25:10,862 --> 00:25:12,062
<font color="yellow">You are...</font>

374
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:16,492
<font color="yellow">Grandma! Uncle!</font>

375
00:25:18,092 --> 00:25:20,662
<font color="yellow">I missed you so much!</font>

376
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:27,532
<font color="yellow">- Grandma, how have you been? - Why are you so frantic?</font>

377
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:29,262
<font color="yellow">Please calm down.</font>

378
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,832
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun, what happened? When did you come back?</font>

379
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,732
<font color="yellow">I arrived early this morning.</font>

380
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,632
<font color="yellow">Grandma, Uncle, let me bow down before you.</font>

381
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:42,362
<font color="yellow">Stop it and just follow me.</font>

382
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:44,062
<font color="yellow">- Grandma. - Jeong Eun, did you have breakfast?</font>

383
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:47,362
<font color="yellow">Mother, why don't you let her eat first?</font>

384
00:25:49,162 --> 00:25:52,962
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you eat like a pig.</font>

385
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:55,562
<font color="yellow">Eat slowly. Here's water.</font>

386
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:58,762
<font color="yellow">You should have some rice instead of ramyeon.</font>

387
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,362
<font color="yellow">I was dying to eat ramyeon.</font>

388
00:26:00,362 --> 00:26:04,062
<font color="yellow">Look at you. Look at your disheveled hair.</font>

389
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:06,192
<font color="yellow">Where on earth have you been?</font>

390
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:09,162
<font color="yellow">- I've been to about 150 countries. - What did you say?</font>

391
00:26:09,662 --> 00:26:13,792
<font color="yellow">You bummed around 150 countries?</font>

392
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:15,862
<font color="yellow">So are you all well?</font>

393
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:17,862
<font color="yellow">I'm more than fine.</font>

394
00:26:18,392 --> 00:26:20,062
<font color="yellow">No matter where I was and what I ate,</font>

395
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:22,292
<font color="yellow">I was always very healthy.</font>

396
00:26:22,892 --> 00:26:25,162
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you're so proud of yourself.</font>

397

<font color="yellow">How can a grown up woman...</font>

398

<font color="yellow">sleep anywhere and eat anything?</font>

399

401
00:26:37,232 --> 00:26:40,432
<font color="yellow">Did you come back to see me pass out?</font>

404
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:13,192
<font color="yellow">Hold on, I got something for you, Ah In.</font>

405
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:19,392
<font color="yellow">Here. This is for you.</font>

00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:29,792
<font color="yellow">Does your mom know that you're back?</font>

409
00:27:30,962 --> 00:27:31,992
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

410
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,492
<font color="yellow">Did you call her?</font>

411
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:44,062

<font color="yellow">- Yes, Mom. - What are you doing?</font>

418
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:18,562
<font color="yellow">I just finished a lesson. Did something happen?</font>

419
00:28:18,662 --> 00:28:20,762
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's something quite big.</font>

420

422
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:28,732
<font color="yellow">you mocked them and rubbed it in, right?</font>

423
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:33,362
<font color="yellow">Mom, I neither mocked them nor rubbed it in.</font>

424
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:36,862
<font color="yellow">I called you to inform you that you're in the same situation.</font>

<font color="yellow">- Her sons? - Yes.</font>

463
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,562
<font color="yellow">- I see. - Is it done?</font>

464
00:30:51,092 --> 00:30:53,832
<font color="yellow">Stay still. Or I can't sew up your wound.</font>

465
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:56,332
<font color="yellow">I said stay still.</font>

466
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,232
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

467
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,962
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye.</font>

468
00:31:15,232 --> 00:31:17,892
<font color="yellow">So it disappeared before 3am, right?</font>

469
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:19,632
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

470
00:31:19,762 --> 00:31:21,832
<font color="yellow">- I was at the convenience store. - What happened?</font>

471
00:31:21,932 --> 00:31:23,192
<font color="yellow">You're back, Sir.</font>

472
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,832
<font color="yellow">All the materials...</font>

473
00:31:26,132 --> 00:31:28,662
<font color="yellow">- disappeared from the storage. - Sorry?</font>

474
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,832
<font color="yellow">- Where are the materials? - They're all gone.</font>

475
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:37,392
<font color="yellow">We're sorry. We must have been more careful.</font>

476
00:31:37,492 --> 00:31:38,762
<font color="yellow">We reported to the police.</font>

477
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,392
<font color="yellow">They'll come to check the security cameras.</font>

478
00:31:41,662 --> 00:31:43,032
<font color="yellow">Sir,</font>

479
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,632
<font color="yellow">I found this on the floor.</font>

480
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:58,562
<font color="yellow">I was sleeping here and...</font>

481
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:01,562
<font color="yellow">you kicked, hugged, and touched me.</font>

482
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:05,062
<font color="yellow">Get out now.</font>

483
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:52,232
<font color="yellow">It's nice to see you again.</font>

484
00:32:52,232 --> 00:32:54,092
<font color="yellow">You visit us about this time every year.</font>

485
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:57,732
<font color="yellow">- I can visit more often now. - I see.</font>

486
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:00,632
<font color="yellow">- Please come in. - Okay.</font>

487
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:14,192
<font color="yellow">(Lee Jae Cheol)</font>

488
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:26,332
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

489
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:29,562
<font color="yellow">Of course I did.</font>

490
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:31,732
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to come.</font>

491
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:33,792
<font color="yellow">I told you I was doing fine.</font>

492
00:33:34,632 --> 00:33:36,732
<font color="yellow">I was working outside and I just came by.</font>

493
00:33:37,562 --> 00:33:39,992
<font color="yellow">How are your in-laws?</font>

494
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:43,632
<font color="yellow">They're happy to see Ah In and Chang Soo, right?</font>

495
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:45,532
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

496
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:47,192
<font color="yellow">Anyway,</font>

497
00:33:47,732 --> 00:33:50,062
<font color="yellow">they were living by themselves.</font>

498
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:53,362
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not making things too uncomfortable for them.</font>

499
00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:56,892
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

500
00:33:58,132 --> 00:33:59,462
<font color="yellow">You wouldn't...</font>

501
00:34:00,032 --> 00:34:03,362
<font color="yellow">want to come and live with us, would you?</font>

502
00:34:05,192 --> 00:34:07,362
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

503
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,332
<font color="yellow">Live with you?</font>

504
00:34:09,662 --> 00:34:13,292
<font color="yellow">In the morning, my father-in-law said...</font>

505
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:17,232
<font color="yellow">you can live in the rooftop room in his building...</font>

506
00:34:17,232 --> 00:34:19,462
<font color="yellow">if you have nowhere else to go.</font>

507
00:34:19,462 --> 00:34:21,762
<font color="yellow">I can't believe what you're saying.</font>

508
00:34:22,532 --> 00:34:25,562
<font color="yellow">And why did you tell him about this?</font>

509
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,362
<font color="yellow">I didn't. Seong Hoon did.</font>

510
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:30,592
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous. I can't live in his house.</font>

511
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:34,362
<font color="yellow">I'd rather die on the street. That will never happen.</font>

512
00:34:35,092 --> 00:34:38,092
<font color="yellow">Stop saying things like that or I'll never see you again.</font>

513
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,592
<font color="yellow">If that's what you want,</font>

514
00:34:42,362 --> 00:34:43,832
<font color="yellow">we'll just move out again.</font>

515
00:34:44,092 --> 00:34:46,002
<font color="yellow">Let's just stay in a motel like we used to.</font>

516
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,432
<font color="yellow">I'd feel better that way.</font>

517
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:50,532
<font color="yellow">It wasn't easy for you to move in. You can't move out again.</font>

518
00:34:50,662 --> 00:34:53,732
<font color="yellow">I told you to stay there until Seong Hoon gets back on his feet.</font>

519
00:34:53,732 --> 00:34:56,432
<font color="yellow">- What about you? - I said don't worry about me.</font>

520
00:34:56,432 --> 00:34:57,962
<font color="yellow">How can I not?</font>

521
00:34:58,332 --> 00:35:00,962
<font color="yellow">What if you get sick staying at places like this?</font>

522
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,092
<font color="yellow">What about Dong Hui?</font>

523
00:35:02,262 --> 00:35:05,262
<font color="yellow">She's all grown up. She can't live like this forever.</font>

524
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,632
<font color="yellow">If you could just come and live with us...</font>

525
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,232
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

526
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:15,462
<font color="yellow">You should go.</font>

527
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:19,232
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever come here again. Do you hear me?</font>

528
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:51,292
<font color="yellow">No, it's fine.</font>

529
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:55,132
<font color="yellow">I already have some experience. They probably didn't like that.</font>

530
00:36:57,962 --> 00:37:00,832
<font color="yellow">Anyway, thank you for everything.</font>

531
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,162
<font color="yellow">Sure. I'll see you later.</font>

532
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:20,292
<font color="yellow">Pour me a drink.</font>

533
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:21,662
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

534
00:37:21,962 --> 00:37:24,662
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised to see me?</font>

535
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:27,432
<font color="yellow">Pour me a drink, too.</font>

536
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,192
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

537
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:53,532
<font color="yellow">Mom. Don't drink too fast. You'll get drunk.</font>

538
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:56,762
<font color="yellow">It's fine. If worse comes to worst, I'll just die.</font>

539
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:03,392
<font color="yellow">We'll just stay with you for two months, so...</font>

540
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:07,392
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter if it's 2 months or 3.</font>

541
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:10,592
<font color="yellow">You should live better so we don't worry about you.</font>

542
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,832
<font color="yellow">It's not about how long you'll stay with us.</font>

543
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:15,362
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

544
00:38:18,092 --> 00:38:19,232
<font color="yellow">Don't be...</font>

545
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:24,562
<font color="yellow">so upset that I'm treating you this way.</font>

546
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:26,162
<font color="yellow">It's hard for me, too.</font>

547
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:28,292
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

548
00:38:28,662 --> 00:38:31,962
<font color="yellow">You'll see how hard it is...</font>

549
00:38:32,292 --> 00:38:33,632
<font color="yellow">when you get older.</font>

550
00:38:34,462 --> 00:38:36,832
<font color="yellow">- Let me. - It's fine.</font>

551
00:38:49,432 --> 00:38:51,762
<font color="yellow">Why did I have so many children?</font>

552
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:55,832
<font color="yellow">I don't even remember how I raised...</font>

553
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,792
<font color="yellow">all four of you.</font>

554
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:03,532
<font color="yellow">I supported all of you when you were in high school.</font>

555
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,662
<font color="yellow">Do you realize that?</font>

556
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,762
<font color="yellow">If I add up all of your school years,</font>

557
00:39:10,662 --> 00:39:12,732
<font color="yellow">it's 64 years in total.</font>

558
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,332
<font color="yellow">Besides, Seong Sik took his bar exam,</font>

559
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:18,262
<font color="yellow">and you took your employment exam.</font>

560
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:23,662
<font color="yellow">I packed your lunch millions of time.</font>

561
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,232
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

562
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:28,562
<font color="yellow">If you do, you should live a happy life.</font>

563
00:39:28,562 --> 00:39:32,502
<font color="yellow">We raised you, educated you, and got you married.</font>

564
00:39:32,962 --> 00:39:35,162
<font color="yellow">What should I do if you just move in like this?</font>

565
00:39:35,162 --> 00:39:37,032
<font color="yellow">Do you know how it will change my life?</font>

566
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:38,662
<font color="yellow">Do you?</font>

567
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:40,862
<font color="yellow">I want to rest.</font>

568
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,292
<font color="yellow">It's my life.</font>

569
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:47,262
<font color="yellow">Let me do the things I want to do.</font>

570
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:50,662
<font color="yellow">When I move out, I'll make Seong Sik move out, too.</font>

571
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:54,332
<font color="yellow">Then you can rent the house and do the things you want to do.</font>

572
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,262
<font color="yellow">All right. Since you brought it up, let's talk about that.</font>

573
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,132
<font color="yellow">Honestly,</font>

574
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:02,762
<font color="yellow">you only gave me some money when you got your first salary.</font>

575
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:06,932
<font color="yellow">After you got married, you never gave me any money.</font>

576
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:11,432
<font color="yellow">Up until now,</font>

577
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:13,562
<font color="yellow">I've never...</font>

578
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,032
<font color="yellow">had any money for myself.</font>

579
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:21,262
<font color="yellow">I used all of your father's salary to raise you.</font>

580
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:26,792
<font color="yellow">I've never had any money for myself in my entire life.</font>

581
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:32,192
<font color="yellow">As I got older, I realized that I need more money than before.</font>

582
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:36,392
<font color="yellow">If I get sick, I should go to the hospital.</font>

583
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:38,792
<font color="yellow">I also need to get my teeth done.</font>

584
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:40,792
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

585
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,362
<font color="yellow">I need money to take care of my grandchildren.</font>

586
00:40:43,362 --> 00:40:46,132
<font color="yellow">Even taking care of my grandchildren costs money.</font>

587
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:49,002
<font color="yellow">When your grandmother gave us the house,</font>

588
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:52,502
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd be able to be...</font>

589
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:57,262
<font color="yellow">a better parent, and to finally enjoy my life.</font>

590
00:40:58,292 --> 00:41:01,662
<font color="yellow">You ungrateful brats!</font>

591
00:41:03,932 --> 00:41:05,762
<font color="yellow">Look who it is.</font>

592
00:41:06,862 --> 00:41:10,192
<font color="yellow">It's Jeong Ae and her eldest son.</font>

593
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:12,632
<font color="yellow">Hello. How are you?</font>

594
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:15,292
<font color="yellow">I'm always great.</font>

595
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:20,092
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - Nothing.</font>

596
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,932
<font color="yellow">I was just on my way home from work.</font>

597
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:27,032
<font color="yellow">Are you showing off that you're living with your son now?</font>

598
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:30,162
<font color="yellow">You're having a drink with your son.</font>

599
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:32,032
<font color="yellow">You look so great.</font>

600
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:37,862
<font color="yellow">I heard your eldest son, a journalist...</font>

601
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:41,632
<font color="yellow">and your second son, a lawyer moved in to take care of you.</font>

602
00:41:44,532 --> 00:41:45,592
<font color="yellow">That's...</font>

603
00:41:46,292 --> 00:41:47,792
<font color="yellow">How did you know that...</font>

604
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:49,792
<font color="yellow">my sons moved in?</font>

605
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,862
<font color="yellow">Everyone living in Bangbae-dong knows that.</font>

606
00:41:54,732 --> 00:41:58,132
<font color="yellow">Still, you should be enjoying your lives by yourselves.</font>

607
00:41:58,132 --> 00:42:00,762
<font color="yellow">Why did you move in to take care of them?</font>

608
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:04,262
<font color="yellow">It's tiring if your children are too good.</font>

609
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:11,192
<font color="yellow">That's right. I moved to Bangbae-dong.</font>

610
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,192
<font color="yellow">It's a 150m² house.</font>

611
00:42:17,132 --> 00:42:19,232
<font color="yellow">Don't ask me about the price.</font>

612
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:22,592
<font color="yellow">I didn't buy it, of course. I can't afford it at this age.</font>

613
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:25,662
<font color="yellow">It's my parents' house.</font>

614
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:31,162
<font color="yellow">Inheritance?</font>

615
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:32,962
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

616
00:42:33,962 --> 00:42:36,032
<font color="yellow">They haven't told us about it yet.</font>

617
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:39,792
<font color="yellow">It will be my inheritance someday.</font>

618
00:42:42,632 --> 00:42:45,962
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we live close by now. Let's have a drink sometime.</font>

619
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:47,332
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

620
00:42:52,932 --> 00:42:56,362
<font color="yellow">Have you heard about what happened to Jin Sook?</font>

621
00:42:56,732 --> 00:43:00,192
<font color="yellow">Goodness. Her children failed in their business,</font>

622
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:01,862
<font color="yellow">and got fired from their work.</font>

623
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:03,932
<font color="yellow">They all came back as a failure.</font>

624
00:43:03,932 --> 00:43:06,002
<font color="yellow">She's having such a hard time.</font>

625
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:09,362
<font color="yellow">She feeds them and babysits her grandchildren.</font>

626
00:43:09,562 --> 00:43:12,962
<font color="yellow">Someone saw her the other day, and she looked like a 70-year-old woman.</font>

627
00:43:13,502 --> 00:43:16,362
<font color="yellow">She's nothing like you.</font>

628
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:19,362
<font color="yellow">You are so lucky.</font>

629
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,362
<font color="yellow">That spiteful woman.</font>

630
00:43:31,062 --> 00:43:34,132
<font color="yellow">She's just trying to rub it in when she knows everything.</font>

631
00:43:36,362 --> 00:43:40,262
<font color="yellow">How can you be friends with a person like her all your life?</font>

632
00:43:42,862 --> 00:43:44,332
<font color="yellow">She hasn't changed a bit.</font>

633
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:47,392
<font color="yellow">What can I do?</font>

634
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:50,192
<font color="yellow">I lived here my whole life.</font>

635
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:56,062
<font color="yellow">You should buy me a house somewhere else then.</font>

636
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:06,062
<font color="yellow">She's such a spiteful woman.</font>

637
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:09,892
<font color="yellow">- Let's walk faster. - Okay.</font>

638
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,962
<font color="yellow">Mom! Seong Hoon!</font>

639
00:44:13,662 --> 00:44:16,062
<font color="yellow">Are you on the way home? Wait for me!</font>

640
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:21,162
<font color="yellow">Or do you want to get some beer before heading home?</font>

641
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:26,662
<font color="yellow">He's advertising to the entire town that he's moved into my house.</font>

642
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:27,832
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

643
00:44:28,392 --> 00:44:29,732
<font color="yellow">- Son. - Yes.</font>

644
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,632
<font color="yellow">- Run. - Okay.</font>

645
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,162
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon! Mom!</font>

646
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:39,662
<font color="yellow">Let's go get some beer! Wait for me!</font>

647
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:42,592
<font color="yellow">Mom! Can't you hear me?</font>

648
00:44:43,332 --> 00:44:46,432
<font color="yellow">Wait for me! What's wrong?</font>

649
00:44:46,962 --> 00:44:50,462
<font color="yellow">Mom! Wait!</font>

650
00:44:55,732 --> 00:44:57,632
<font color="yellow">- Give me your luggage. - Thank you.</font>

651
00:44:58,832 --> 00:44:59,862
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi.</font>

652
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,132
<font color="yellow">It's raining.</font>

653
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,392
<font color="yellow">Go in, Moong Chi.</font>

654
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:14,132
<font color="yellow">- Please go to Bangbae-dong. - Okay.</font>

655
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,492
<font color="yellow">You pervert! Let's sleep together.</font>

656
00:46:57,492 --> 00:47:00,392
<font color="yellow">You will sleep all night like this with me.</font>

657
00:47:00,662 --> 00:47:02,732
<font color="yellow">You pervert!</font>

658
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:05,562
<font color="yellow">That brat!</font>

659
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:07,662
<font color="yellow">We can't pass because of the construction vehicle.</font>

660
00:48:07,832 --> 00:48:08,992
<font color="yellow">Is that right?</font>

661
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:13,092
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

662
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,962
<font color="yellow">- I will get off here. - Okay.</font>

663
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,832
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

664
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:33,032
<font color="yellow">- Here is your luggage. - Thank you. Take care.</font>

665
00:48:39,392 --> 00:48:40,862
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, run!</font>

666
00:49:31,932 --> 00:49:33,932
<font color="yellow">Shush. You can't bark right now.</font>

667
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:41,232
<font color="yellow">We're here. This is our home.</font>

668
00:49:56,392 --> 00:49:58,032
<font color="yellow">Let's go in, Moong Chi.</font>

669
00:50:08,492 --> 00:50:10,862
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon! - Dad!</font>

670
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:19,192
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

671
00:50:19,832 --> 00:50:22,432
<font color="yellow">I'm home, Mom. Have you been well?</font>

672
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:25,662
<font color="yellow">- Seong Joon. - Why did you arrive so late?</font>

673
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:27,562
<font color="yellow">The flight got delayed.</font>

674
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:37,932
<font color="yellow">Great.</font>

675
00:50:44,462 --> 00:50:46,562
<font color="yellow">Your youngest son Seong Joon came back...</font>

676
00:50:46,562 --> 00:50:48,662
<font color="yellow">safely after working in Shanghai.</font>

677
00:50:48,662 --> 00:50:52,492
<font color="yellow">Yes. Good job. I am so proud of you, my son.</font>

678
00:50:53,132 --> 00:50:54,962
<font color="yellow">Good job, dear.</font>

679
00:50:55,562 --> 00:50:56,562
<font color="yellow">Thanks, Mom.</font>

680
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,792
<font color="yellow">By the way, you don't look too well.</font>

681
00:51:03,832 --> 00:51:06,592
<font color="yellow">No, nothing's wrong with your mom.</font>

682
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:10,492
<font color="yellow">You're going to catch cold. Go wash up and rest.</font>

683
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:14,062
<font color="yellow">We should turn on the heater. Did you call the company?</font>

684
00:51:15,462 --> 00:51:16,862
<font color="yellow">It's already fixed.</font>

685
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:31,162
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, you can take shower now.</font>

686
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:32,992
<font color="yellow">Okay, Dad.</font>

687
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:39,662
<font color="yellow">You should rest.</font>

688
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:42,262
<font color="yellow">My youngest son is finally back.</font>

689
00:52:02,492 --> 00:52:04,092
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!</font>

690
00:52:05,632 --> 00:52:06,792
<font color="yellow">You darn dog!</font>

691
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:08,962
<font color="yellow">You're back as well.</font>

692
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:12,492
<font color="yellow">Granny, where do we eat breakfast?</font>

693
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:20,892
<font color="yellow">Granny, whose dog is this?</font>

694
00:52:21,032 --> 00:52:22,132
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon is home.</font>

695
00:52:23,092 --> 00:52:25,662
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon is back? Really?</font>

696
00:52:25,662 --> 00:52:27,162
<font color="yellow">That's Seong Joon Junior.</font>

697
00:52:30,862 --> 00:52:32,962
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon!</font>

698
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:36,932
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

699
00:52:39,162 --> 00:52:40,662
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, eat a lot.</font>

700
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,492
<font color="yellow">How long has it been?</font>

701
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:46,192
<font color="yellow">I think it's been around two years.</font>

702
00:52:46,362 --> 00:52:47,962
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

703
00:52:48,262 --> 00:52:50,832
<font color="yellow">I am so proud of you.</font>

704
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:55,032
<font color="yellow">You did something great while working in Shanghai for two years,</font>

705
00:52:55,562 --> 00:52:57,962
<font color="yellow">and you gloriously returned to Korea last night. Am I right?</font>

706
00:52:59,732 --> 00:53:02,992
<font color="yellow">You should learn from your uncle too, okay?</font>

707
00:53:03,032 --> 00:53:04,192
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

708
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:07,462
<font color="yellow">Eat a lot, Seong Joon.</font>

709
00:53:07,492 --> 00:53:10,892
<font color="yellow">Mother cooked so many dishes because you came back.</font>

710
00:53:12,032 --> 00:53:14,632
<font color="yellow">This is what makes me disappointed in Mom.</font>

711
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:18,232
<font color="yellow">When we moved in, she yelled at us to get out of here.</font>

712
00:53:18,232 --> 00:53:21,232
<font color="yellow">Then she cooked all these dishes for Seong Joon.</font>

713
00:53:22,092 --> 00:53:24,732
<font color="yellow">Mom! This isn't fair!</font>

714
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:26,732
<font color="yellow">- Honey. - By the way,</font>

715
00:53:26,732 --> 00:53:29,062
<font color="yellow">what is she doing with Seong Hoon?</font>

716
00:53:30,192 --> 00:53:32,532
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon!</font>

717
00:53:32,532 --> 00:53:33,632
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun.</font>

718
00:53:34,392 --> 00:53:36,862
<font color="yellow">It's been such a long time! Let me see your face.</font>

719
00:53:38,162 --> 00:53:40,262
<font color="yellow">- How have you been? - Good. When did you come back?</font>

720
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:41,292
<font color="yellow">Last night.</font>

721
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:43,862
<font color="yellow">Hey. Keep it down.</font>

722
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:45,532
<font color="yellow">It's too early for that noise.</font>

723
00:53:46,332 --> 00:53:49,032
<font color="yellow">Mom, Dad! Come and have breakfast!</font>

724
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:50,592
<font color="yellow">Eat up.</font>

725
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:55,292
<font color="yellow">You must be out of your mind!</font>

726
00:53:55,292 --> 00:53:57,392
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Jeong Ae.</font>

727
00:53:58,262 --> 00:54:00,092
<font color="yellow">The kids will hear you. Keep it down.</font>

728
00:54:00,262 --> 00:54:03,092
<font color="yellow">What did you say you were going to raise?</font>

729
00:54:03,292 --> 00:54:04,362
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

730
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:06,632
<font color="yellow">I thought raising penguins and selling them to Africa would be...</font>

731
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:10,162
<font color="yellow">Mom, let me tell you.</font>

732
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:13,562
<font color="yellow">Penguins are endangered because of the global warming.</font>

733
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,932
<font color="yellow">- If we raise a lot of them... - I can't take this.</font>

734
00:54:15,932 --> 00:54:17,592
<font color="yellow">I'll kill you, and kill myself.</font>

735
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:19,962
<font color="yellow">I'm not kidding this time.</font>

736
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:21,462
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you idiot.</font>

737
00:54:21,462 --> 00:54:22,492
<font color="yellow">- Dear. - Jeong Ae.</font>

738
00:54:23,162 --> 00:54:25,932
<font color="yellow">You can scold him some other time.</font>

739
00:54:26,432 --> 00:54:28,132
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do about Hye Joo's grandmother?</font>

740
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:31,232
<font color="yellow">He lost her house and store.</font>

741
00:54:31,232 --> 00:54:32,662
<font color="yellow">She's now staying at a sauna.</font>

742
00:54:32,662 --> 00:54:35,762
<font color="yellow">As his parents, we should do something about it.</font>

743
00:54:35,762 --> 00:54:39,332
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I don't care! I really have no idea.</font>

744
00:54:39,332 --> 00:54:40,832
<font color="yellow">Come here, you brat.</font>

745
00:54:40,832 --> 00:54:43,662
<font color="yellow">- You've never been helpful. - My gosh.</font>

746
00:54:43,792 --> 00:54:45,292
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

747
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:46,962
<font color="yellow">Mom, please calm down.</font>

748
00:55:05,832 --> 00:55:08,032
<font color="yellow">- Hello? - Elizabeth?</font>

749
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:10,362
<font color="yellow">Who is this?</font>

750
00:55:10,462 --> 00:55:12,292
<font color="yellow">It's me, Grace.</font>

751
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:13,592
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

752
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:16,892
<font color="yellow">It's me, Hwang Mi Ok. You called me Grace Kelly.</font>

753
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:21,932
<font color="yellow">Yes. How have you been?</font>

754
00:55:22,662 --> 00:55:24,832
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking to me so politely?</font>

755
00:55:25,932 --> 00:55:28,792
<font color="yellow">Let me get straight to the point.</font>

756
00:55:29,032 --> 00:55:31,832
<font color="yellow">Move in while our doors are still open.</font>

757
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:35,262
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you answering?</font>

758
00:55:35,662 --> 00:55:39,532
<font color="yellow">I know you're as graceful as the Queen Elizabeth,</font>

759
00:55:39,662 --> 00:55:43,562
<font color="yellow">and I know you try not to owe anyone anything.</font>

760
00:55:43,662 --> 00:55:45,392
<font color="yellow">But Seong Hoon is...</font>

761
00:55:45,862 --> 00:55:47,992
<font color="yellow">about to get beaten up to death...</font>

762
00:55:48,032 --> 00:55:51,162
<font color="yellow">by his parents because he blew your store.</font>

763
00:55:51,362 --> 00:55:54,532
<font color="yellow">I heard you were worried about your children, too.</font>

764
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:57,962
<font color="yellow">So let's make up later and...</font>

765
00:55:58,462 --> 00:56:01,762
<font color="yellow">for today, please be gentle and move in.</font>

766
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:03,332
<font color="yellow">I'll send Seong Hoon to pick you up.</font>

767

<font color="yellow">You're not answering again.</font>

768
00:56:07,762 --> 00:56:09,832
<font color="yellow">Do you have a problem with this?</font>

769
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:11,862
<font color="yellow">One more thing.</font>

770
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:15,262
<font color="yellow">Do you like dogs?</font>

771
00:56:18,362 --> 00:56:19,562
<font color="yellow">Did she just hang up?</font>

772
00:56:22,932 --> 00:56:25,962
<font color="yellow">She hasn't changed at all.</font>

773
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:33,862
<font color="yellow">Grandma. What's wrong? Who were you talking to?</font>

774
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:37,092
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. Go to work. I'll see you later.</font>

775

780
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:54,732
<font color="yellow">Get inside, Grandma.</font>

781
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:56,762
<font color="yellow">Okay. Go.</font>

782
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:58,132
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

783
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:15,592
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. Keep quiet.</font>

784
00:57:16,732 --> 00:57:17,932
<font color="yellow">That punk.</font>

785
00:57:18,532 --> 00:57:19,992
<font color="yellow">That little...</font>

786
00:57:41,732 --> 00:57:43,192
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to pay you in advance?</font>

787
00:57:43,532 --> 00:57:47,532
<font color="yellow">Look. You've been working here for a few days only.</font>

788
00:57:47,732 --> 00:57:50,492
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't urgent.</font>

789
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:53,262
<font color="yellow">I'll work hard like a full-time employee.</font>

790
00:57:53,732 --> 00:57:56,162
<font color="yellow">Sir. Please help me out once.</font>

791
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:58,862
<font color="yellow">- Listen. - I'm a reliable person.</font>

792

793
00:58:01,392 --> 00:58:02,862
<font color="yellow">Just find somewhere else to work.</font>

794
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:06,392
<font color="yellow">I don't want to hire a part-timer like you.</font>

795
00:58:07,662 --> 00:58:08,762
<font color="yellow">Excuse me?</font>

796
00:58:20,662 --> 00:58:22,392

<font color="yellow">- What is this? - Congratulations on your return.</font>

798
00:58:29,032 --> 00:58:31,662
<font color="yellow">You must have gone through so much for the past two years.</font>

799
00:58:31,662 --> 00:58:33,092
<font color="yellow">Welcome back.</font>

800
00:58:33,392 --> 00:58:36,062
<font color="yellow">Go, Han Seong Joon!</font>

<font color="yellow">(Meeting Room)</font>

805
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:51,962
<font color="yellow">I can't believe them.</font>

806
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:55,192
<font color="yellow">They should appreciate your hard work first.</font>

807
00:58:55,432 --> 00:58:58,162
<font color="yellow">Why would they start nitpicking right away?</font>

808
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:02,132
<font color="yellow">To them, getting result is more important.</font>

809
00:59:03,462 --> 00:59:06,992
<font color="yellow">My dad is in Europe. He'll be back next month.</font>

810
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:08,662
<font color="yellow">Just give him a call today.</font>

811
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,632
<font color="yellow">Is that so? All right.</font>

812
00:59:13,992 --> 00:59:15,192
<font color="yellow">Get us some tea.</font>

813
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:21,662
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

814
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,192
<font color="yellow">I was going to give it to you.</font>

815
00:59:28,392 --> 00:59:31,032
<font color="yellow">Before you came, someone brought this bag here.</font>

816
00:59:32,762 --> 00:59:34,262
<font color="yellow">What was her name?</font>

817
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:35,892
<font color="yellow">Oh Dong Hui?</font>

818
00:59:36,592 --> 00:59:39,532
<font color="yellow">- What? - I heard you lost her passport...</font>

819
00:59:39,592 --> 00:59:41,632
<font color="yellow">and helped her issue a new one.</font>

820
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,562
<font color="yellow">Yes. That's right.</font>

821
00:59:46,492 --> 00:59:47,592
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

822
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:49,932
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

823
00:59:50,532 --> 00:59:52,832
<font color="yellow">I thought I'd never find this bag.</font>

824
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,892
<font color="yellow">I'm overwhelmed.</font>

825
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:59,032
<font color="yellow">Overwhelmed?</font>

826
00:59:59,992 --> 01:00:03,392
<font color="yellow">My dad bought me this when I entered college.</font>

827
01:00:04,862 --> 01:00:06,032
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

828
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:09,132
<font color="yellow">I was surprised because I didn't know that.</font>

829
01:00:11,132 --> 01:00:14,962
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner together. We should celebrate your return.</font>

<font color="yellow">No.</font>

831
01:00:17,662 --> 01:00:19,632
<font color="yellow">I'm having dinner with my family today.</font>

832
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:23,132
<font color="yellow">I got home so late last night. I didn't have time to talk to them.</font>

833
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:26,532
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

834
01:00:31,092 --> 01:00:32,232
<font color="yellow">Grandmother.</font>

835
01:00:32,592 --> 01:00:35,292
<font color="yellow">If you give me two months,</font>

836
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:38,762
<font color="yellow">I'll find a place for us to live. So please...</font>

837

839
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:50,632
<font color="yellow">Besides, you and my grandmother are similar in age,</font>

840

<font color="yellow">How have you been?</font>

844
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:13,432
<font color="yellow">I've been good.</font>

845
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:16,992
<font color="yellow">How is your stay here? Isn't it uncomfortable?</font>

846
01:01:18,832 --> 01:01:21,232
<font color="yellow">- It's fine. - No, it's not.</font>

847
01:01:21,662 --> 01:01:24,932
<font color="yellow">You're a grown woman. It must be hard and uncomfortable.</font>

848
01:01:25,492 --> 01:01:27,432
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Pack your things.</font>

849
01:01:27,992 --> 01:01:29,062
<font color="yellow">Go where?</font>

<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. I'll get my car. Come out with Grandmother, okay?</font>

855
01:01:48,462 --> 01:01:50,662

<font color="yellow">We meet again. Anyway, it's good to see you.</font>

865

<font color="yellow">- Let's go to the police station. - Don't come after me.</font>

866
01:03:11,232 --> 01:03:14,032
<font color="yellow">You ran away? You're so done if I catch you.</font>

867

<font color="yellow">Does that sound normal?</font>

871
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:26,062
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make loads of money.</font>

872
01:03:26,262 --> 01:03:28,292
<font color="yellow">I heard you are the new in-law who moved in yesterday.</font>

873

<font color="yellow">Please keep this a secret to my grandmother.</font>

875
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:35,792
<font color="yellow">Then what will you do for me?</font>
