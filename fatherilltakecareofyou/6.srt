00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:09,188
<font color="yellow">Wait here. I'll get your toiletries.</font>

2
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:12,158
<font color="yellow">Are you...</font>

3
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:17,788
<font color="yellow">the president of Golden Street at Wall Street in New York?</font>

4
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:21,958
<font color="yellow">Aren't you David Lee who always ate the cucumber sandwich?</font>

5
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:35,028
<font color="yellow">You always came in around 3am and bought a cucumber sandwich.</font>

6
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:38,028
<font color="yellow">You're David Lee, the president of Golden Street, aren't you?</font>

7
00:00:41,028 --> 00:00:42,088
<font color="yellow">I remember now.</font>

8
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:45,858
<font color="yellow">With my memory, I should be working for NASA.</font>

9
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,258
<font color="yellow">Don't you...</font>

10
00:00:51,928 --> 00:00:53,028
<font color="yellow">remember me?</font>

11
00:00:53,528 --> 00:00:56,758
<font color="yellow">I used to work as a cashier...</font>

12
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:58,928
<font color="yellow">at a sandwich shop in front of Golden Street.</font>

13
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,788
<font color="yellow">I used to serve you all the time.</font>

14
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:04,888
<font color="yellow">It was three years ago.</font>

15
00:01:05,158 --> 00:01:07,728
<font color="yellow">So it was the winter of 2013.</font>

16
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:09,188
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember?</font>

17
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,788
<font color="yellow">(3 years ago in New York)</font>

18
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:33,858
<font color="yellow">Welcome to Carnival Sandwich.</font>

19
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,228
<font color="yellow">I would just get a sandwich and coffee, please.</font>

20
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,458
<font color="yellow">How would you like your sandwich?</font>

21
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:43,028
<font color="yellow">Just cucumbers and mayonnaise.</font>

22
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:52,088
<font color="yellow">You always came at 3am and ordered that weird sandwich.</font>

23
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:53,688
<font color="yellow">The reason I remember you is...</font>

24
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,028
<font color="yellow">out of all the vegetables, you only wanted...</font>

25
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,158
<font color="yellow">cucumbers and mayonnaise.</font>

26
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:01,388
<font color="yellow">I thought your taste in food was cheap.</font>

27
00:02:01,958 --> 00:02:03,428
<font color="yellow">That's why I remember you.</font>

28
00:02:04,728 --> 00:02:08,398
<font color="yellow">So I told you that the sandwich wasn't nutritious,</font>

29
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,658
<font color="yellow">and you told me to mind my own business.</font>

30
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:14,358
<font color="yellow">You told me to focus on my job. You were so mean. Don't you remember?</font>

31
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:18,758
<font color="yellow">Anyway, what a small world.</font>

32
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,488
<font color="yellow">Come on.</font>

33
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:25,658
<font color="yellow">Nice to see you again.</font>

34
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:29,928
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Jeong Eun?</font>

35
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:32,258
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

36
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,988
<font color="yellow">Why are you crouching down?</font>

37
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:37,628
<font color="yellow">I was just saying hi.</font>

38
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,628
<font color="yellow">Why would you say hi like that?</font>

39
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,828
<font color="yellow">Don't you live across my house?</font>

40
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,958
<font color="yellow">Yes, I do. Hello.</font>

41
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,588
<font color="yellow">Do you know him, too?</font>

42
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,458
<font color="yellow">Of course, I do. He moved in across the street.</font>

43
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:54,488
<font color="yellow">Is that so?</font>

44
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,588
<font color="yellow">I met him coincidentally, but it turns out...</font>

45
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,088
<font color="yellow">Well. I should get going, then.</font>

46
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,758
<font color="yellow">Take care.</font>

47
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:06,828
<font color="yellow">Hey, what about my toiletries and my necklace?</font>

48
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:08,028
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

49
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:24,658
<font color="yellow">Hey, give me back mine. You told me that you would.</font>

50
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,658
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

51
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,358
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

52
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,358
<font color="yellow">I need to get something from him.</font>

53
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:33,988
<font color="yellow">Hey, return my things quickly. What are you doing?</font>

54
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:37,688
<font color="yellow">I followed you because you said you would give back. Hey!</font>

55
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,188
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - Jeong Eun.</font>

56
00:03:40,758 --> 00:03:44,028
<font color="yellow">You'll wake up the whole neighborhood. Maybe he's busy.</font>

57
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,958
<font color="yellow">You can get your things tomorrow morning.</font>

58
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:48,888
<font color="yellow">He's not busy.</font>

59
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,858
<font color="yellow">I only came here because he said he would give them.</font>

60
00:03:51,288 --> 00:03:52,988
<font color="yellow">What a jerk. You know that?</font>

61
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:54,388
<font color="yellow">Come inside.</font>

62
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,728
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

63
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:08,058
<font color="yellow">I need you to check something.</font>

64
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:11,958
<font color="yellow">Check if there was a Korean woman named Han Jeong Eun who worked...</font>

65
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:14,788
<font color="yellow">at a sandwich shop called Carnival Sandwich in front of Golden Street.</font>

66
00:04:16,128 --> 00:04:18,728
<font color="yellow">- Her nickname was Golden Cat. - Okay.</font>

67
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:36,758
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you sleeping?</font>

68
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,158
<font color="yellow">It is him.</font>

69
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,158
<font color="yellow">I asked you why you aren't sleeping.</font>

70
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:45,728
<font color="yellow">Please go to sleep. Don't interrupt me when I'm thinking.</font>

71
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,358
<font color="yellow">You are mumbling. It's scary.</font>

72
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,588
<font color="yellow">Who in the right mind will marry her?</font>

73
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:05,928
<font color="yellow">Okay. Good for you.</font>

74
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:09,028
<font color="yellow">I came to visit you and you make me work at your shop at this hour.</font>

75
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:12,658
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do if I get robbed?</font>

76
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,088
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'm clueless?</font>

77
00:05:14,088 --> 00:05:17,158
<font color="yellow">I know you gave me this shift so you can spend time with your boyfriend.</font>

78
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,658
<font color="yellow">Fine. I'll deal with it.</font>

79
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:23,288
<font color="yellow">It's only until I save enough money to go to South America.</font>

80
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:24,528
<font color="yellow">I'm hanging up now.</font>

81
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,988
<font color="yellow">Welcome to Carnival Sandwich.</font>

82
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,758
<font color="yellow">I will just get a sandwich and coffee please.</font>

83
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:40,288
<font color="yellow">How would you like your sandwich?</font>

84
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:42,428
<font color="yellow">Just cucumbers and mayonnaise.</font>

85
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:46,458
<font color="yellow">Okay, but that won't be very healthy.</font>

86
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:49,458
<font color="yellow">We offer a variety of other vegetables.</font>

87
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,458
<font color="yellow">Would you like some?</font>

88
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,188
<font color="yellow">That's none of your business, is it?</font>

89
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:57,958
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

90
00:05:58,728 --> 00:06:01,288
<font color="yellow">Just sell what the customers ask for.</font>

91
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,788
<font color="yellow">Just do your job.</font>

92
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:07,458
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

93
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,128
<font color="yellow">are you Korean?</font>

94
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,928
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - Are you from Korea?</font>

95
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:16,188
<font color="yellow">No, I'm Chinese.</font>

96
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:44,088
<font color="yellow">Happy Halloween.</font>

97
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,358
<font color="yellow">Freeze. Hands in the air.</font>

98
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,488
<font color="yellow">Turn around and face the wall.</font>

99
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:52,828
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

100
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:58,528
<font color="yellow">You. Take out everything from the register.</font>

101
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:02,728
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

102
00:07:08,588 --> 00:07:11,158
<font color="yellow">I won't even make it to South America.</font>

103
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,058
<font color="yellow">What are you mumbling about?</font>

104
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:15,688
<font color="yellow">Speak in English.</font>

105
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:18,858
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

106
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:24,828
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to make it to South America.</font>

107
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:26,688
<font color="yellow">Hurry up.</font>

108
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,688
<font color="yellow">- Hurry up. - Okay.</font>

109
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:47,458
<font color="yellow">You are here.</font>

110
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,458
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Call the police.</font>

111
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:58,458
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

112
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,488
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

113
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:29,658
<font color="yellow">You are Korean, aren't you?</font>

114
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:32,798
<font color="yellow">- Then why did you lie? - Are you an international student?</font>

115
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,458
<font color="yellow">No, I am.</font>

116
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,028
<font color="yellow">Because it's a hassle.</font>

117
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:41,558
<font color="yellow">- What? - Bring the sandwich and coffee.</font>

118
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,488
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

119
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,528
<font color="yellow">I'm grateful you caught the robber,</font>

120
00:08:47,558 --> 00:08:49,728
<font color="yellow">but you are mean. Are you always like this?</font>

121
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:00,588
<font color="yellow">Good for you. How can you make me work even if I'm leaving today?</font>

122
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:04,328
<font color="yellow">Even though I did get to save up for Brazil, but you are mean.</font>

123
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,328
<font color="yellow">Anyway, after I'm done delivering this...</font>

124
00:09:07,328 --> 00:09:08,828
<font color="yellow">I have to go to the airport right away.</font>

125
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,358
<font color="yellow">So come on time to the shop.</font>

126
00:09:11,728 --> 00:09:14,328
<font color="yellow">I'm never going to work at your shop ever again.</font>

127
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:16,058
<font color="yellow">Did you get that? See you later.</font>

128
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,028
<font color="yellow">Over here.</font>

129
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:22,828
<font color="yellow">- 20 sandwiches? - Yes, that's right.</font>

130
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,728
<font color="yellow">Do you know who ordered this one?</font>

131
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,188
<font color="yellow">Can you bring it to the executive's office over there?</font>

132
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:33,558
<font color="yellow">Okay. Thank you.</font>

133
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,258
<font color="yellow">Was he the President of this company?</font>

134
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,688
<font color="yellow">I would never see him again.</font>

135
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:38,958
<font color="yellow">Hey, David.</font>

136
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:42,728
<font color="yellow">Why don't you give me my necklace and toiletries back?</font>

137
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,528
<font color="yellow">You said you would give them back.</font>

138
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,328
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you keeping your word?</font>

139
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,688
<font color="yellow">Hey, David. Are you listening to me?</font>

140
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:53,728
<font color="yellow">Give them back now!</font>

141
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,858
<font color="yellow">Give them back!</font>

142
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:10,388
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's so cold. Why would people jog so early in the morning?</font>

143
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,528
<font color="yellow">I get it. You have a nice body.</font>

144
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:22,728
<font color="yellow">Ma'am. You should be preparing breakfast.</font>

145
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:28,258
<font color="yellow">I love you.</font>

146
00:11:30,658 --> 00:11:32,058
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it's freezing.</font>

147
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,528
<font color="yellow">She should be here by now.</font>

148
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:57,188
<font color="yellow">Look who it is.</font>

149
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,828
<font color="yellow">You're Jang Yoo Ra, the news anchor.</font>

150
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:03,528
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I didn't expect to see you here. What a small world!</font>

151
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:06,258
<font color="yellow">- Do you live around here? - Yes.</font>

152
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:09,058
<font color="yellow">I live in Bangbae-dong. How about you?</font>

153
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:10,458
<font color="yellow">I live in Banpo-dong.</font>

154
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:14,258
<font color="yellow">My gosh. I can't believe we're neighbors.</font>

155
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:17,688
<font color="yellow">I live in a house in Bangbae-dong. It's 150m².</font>

156
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,358
<font color="yellow">I guess you jog here every morning.</font>

157
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:27,758
<font color="yellow">Yes. Do you jog in the morning, too?</font>

158
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:30,828
<font color="yellow">Of course. I work out every morning.</font>

159
00:12:30,828 --> 00:12:33,928
<font color="yellow">Only then I can start my mornings happily.</font>

160
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:34,988
<font color="yellow">If I don't,</font>

161
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,888
<font color="yellow">I won't feel so good.</font>

162
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,528
<font color="yellow">By the way, what are you doing tonight?</font>

163
00:12:53,828 --> 00:12:55,188
<font color="yellow">I have a show to host.</font>

164
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:59,128
<font color="yellow">That's right. We'll be on the same show tonight.</font>

165
00:12:59,788 --> 00:13:02,788
<font color="yellow">Why don't we have dinner together afterwards?</font>

166
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:04,888
<font color="yellow">I think we were meant to meet here like this.</font>

167
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,388
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

168
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:09,488
<font color="yellow">Just have dinner with me.</font>

169
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:12,158
<font color="yellow">I know a great restaurant.</font>

170
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,388
<font color="yellow">How does that sound?</font>

171
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,288
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

172
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:17,628
<font color="yellow">Let's have dinner together.</font>

173
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,558
<font color="yellow">How about watching a movie after that?</font>

174
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:22,488
<font color="yellow">Hey, wait.</font>

175
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,128
<font color="yellow">Slow down.</font>

176
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:27,258
<font color="yellow">Why are you running so fast?</font>

177
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:31,458
<font color="yellow">I wonder the kids are having a good breakfast.</font>

178
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:35,188
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

179
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:39,158
<font color="yellow">Why do you care if they're having a good breakfast or not?</font>

180
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,988
<font color="yellow">I just said it because this soup is delicious.</font>

181
00:13:43,228 --> 00:13:45,888
<font color="yellow">I just wondered if they made any soup.</font>

182
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,828
<font color="yellow">I told you not to care about them...</font>

183
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,158
<font color="yellow">and the food they eat.</font>

184
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,858
<font color="yellow">How can I not care? We live in the same building.</font>

185
00:13:54,858 --> 00:13:58,528
<font color="yellow">Even so, we should keep our private life separates from them.</font>

186
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:02,058
<font color="yellow">I told you already. If you don't, I won't be able to stand it.</font>

187
00:14:04,088 --> 00:14:05,158
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

188
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,858
<font color="yellow">I have things to say to you, too.</font>

189
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:09,528
<font color="yellow">Your brothers moved in with their children.</font>

190
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,358
<font color="yellow">Is that why you decided to bring your dog in, too?</font>

191
00:14:12,388 --> 00:14:16,388
<font color="yellow">How could you bring your dog from China? How?</font>

192
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:20,488
<font color="yellow">Mom. Moong Chi is a low-maintenance dog.</font>

193
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:23,328
<font color="yellow">There're no low-maintenance animals.</font>

194
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:26,258
<font color="yellow">It takes a lot of efforts to keep a dog.</font>

195
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,388
<font color="yellow">When your brothers were young,</font>

196
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,728
<font color="yellow">they brought a dog, a cat,</font>

197
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:34,258
<font color="yellow">and even a pigeon into the house.</font>

198
00:14:34,258 --> 00:14:36,988
<font color="yellow">I fed the dog, cleaned up the cat's droppings,</font>

199
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:39,688
<font color="yellow">and checked if the pigeon's wing had healed or not.</font>

200
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:42,388
<font color="yellow">It died eventually, so I buried it in the mountain.</font>

201
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:45,928
<font color="yellow">When I was climbing down, it started to rain. It was so hard.</font>

202
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:50,658
<font color="yellow">Why are you laughing?</font>

203
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,658
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

204
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:56,328
<font color="yellow">Take care of your own dog. Okay?</font>

205
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,988
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

206
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,188
<font color="yellow">You should stop.</font>

207
00:15:00,588 --> 00:15:01,858
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

208
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:04,988
<font color="yellow">You're such a bad-tempered woman.</font>

209
00:15:06,128 --> 00:15:07,788
<font color="yellow">Go on and eat.</font>

210
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:33,358
<font color="yellow">Ah In.</font>

211
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:36,528
<font color="yellow">Ah In. It's time to go to preschool.</font>

212
00:15:36,858 --> 00:15:38,658
<font color="yellow">Why did you make a mess here?</font>

213
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:43,228
<font color="yellow">Daddy. Do I look better in this dress, or in this dress?</font>

214
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,988
<font color="yellow">We don't have time. Just wear what you're wearing.</font>

215
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,588
<font color="yellow">Now, let's go.</font>

216
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,028
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Dad.</font>

217
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:54,528
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Please give me another bowl of rice.</font>

218
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:05,128
<font color="yellow">Why didn't you eat any of that delicious food?</font>

219
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:07,828
<font color="yellow">Do you like my mom's food?</font>

220
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,558
<font color="yellow">Of course. It's so good.</font>

221
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,128
<font color="yellow">Your mom's food is the most delicious one in the world.</font>

222
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:14,958
<font color="yellow">Then eat it by yourself.</font>

223
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,858
<font color="yellow">Wait for me.</font>

224
00:16:21,588 --> 00:16:23,428
<font color="yellow">Why isn't she giving us a ride today?</font>

225
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:27,658
<font color="yellow">Do you want her to give us a ride?</font>

226
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:30,488
<font color="yellow">Of course. Her car is the most comfortable one.</font>

227
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:33,988
<font color="yellow">You should be her son instead. My mom's car makes me sick.</font>

228
00:16:40,328 --> 00:16:41,988
<font color="yellow">Wait for me, Ji Hoon!</font>

229
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,228
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. I'm late. - Hye Joo.</font>

230
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:58,328
<font color="yellow">- Can I talk to you for a minute? - What?</font>

231
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,888
<font color="yellow">About what?</font>

232
00:17:02,728 --> 00:17:03,758
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

233
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:08,628
<font color="yellow">I didn't realize this before, but your mom is so pretty.</font>

234
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,788
<font color="yellow">I want to marry someone like her.</font>

235
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:15,158
<font color="yellow">She's pretty, good at cooking and driving,</font>

236
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,658
<font color="yellow">and she makes a beautiful home. Right?</font>

237
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:31,458
<font color="yellow">Why does he hate her so much? I like her.</font>

238
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:41,058
<font color="yellow">Please prepare breakfast for your children.</font>

239
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:44,588
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that Chang Soo eats breakfast here every day?</font>

240
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:47,188
<font color="yellow">Did Chang Soo eat breakfast here every day?</font>

241
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:50,428
<font color="yellow">Yes. He thinks it's his house. He comes to eat every day.</font>

242
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:54,628
<font color="yellow">I know you're living downstairs,</font>

243
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:57,498
<font color="yellow">but he should have a sense of shame.</font>

244
00:17:57,528 --> 00:18:00,158
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - That's not all. He's slow-witted.</font>

245
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,388
<font color="yellow">I make gestures to stop him from coming, but he doesn't stop eating.</font>

246
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,558
<font color="yellow">That's why he's gotten so fat.</font>

247
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:10,758
<font color="yellow">Look. I'm sorry,</font>

248
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,088
<font color="yellow">but you should watch your language.</font>

249
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:17,058
<font color="yellow">It's not like he got fat because you fed him.</font>

250
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,588
<font color="yellow">I've been feeding him all along.</font>

251
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:23,588
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Were you even listening to me?</font>

252
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:25,788
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

253
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:28,288
<font color="yellow">here.</font>

254
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,288
<font color="yellow">What's this?</font>

255
00:18:30,728 --> 00:18:32,758
<font color="yellow">It's Chang Soo's tab at the school cafeteria.</font>

256
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,188
<font color="yellow">The clerk thought I was Chang Soo's mother, so I had to pay it instead.</font>

257
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:41,588
<font color="yellow">If you had been feeding him well, he wouldn't have eaten...</font>

258
00:18:41,658 --> 00:18:44,228
<font color="yellow">356.75-dollar worth of bread.</font>

259
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:47,458
<font color="yellow">- My gosh. That brat. - Another thing.</font>

260
00:18:47,658 --> 00:18:50,558
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo listens to music at night.</font>

261
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:54,288
<font color="yellow">Doesn't it bother you that he falls asleep...</font>

262
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:57,028
<font color="yellow">with the music on? We can hear it from upstairs.</font>

263
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:58,058
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

264
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:02,888
<font color="yellow">I hear you. Let's talk about this later.</font>

265
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:04,688
<font color="yellow">I'm late for work.</font>

266
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,588
<font color="yellow">You're not the only busy person. I'm busy, too.</font>

267
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:10,058
<font color="yellow">Did you just yell at me?</font>

268
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,158
<font color="yellow">You think working women are the only busy ones.</font>

269
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:14,828
<font color="yellow">Housewives are very busy, too.</font>

270
00:19:14,828 --> 00:19:17,358
<font color="yellow">Do you know that I couldn't give Ji Hoon a ride...</font>

271
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,758
<font color="yellow">because I wanted to talk to you?</font>

272
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:23,528
<font color="yellow">I said let's talk about this later in the evening.</font>

273
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:24,728
<font color="yellow">I'm saying...</font>

274
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:27,458
<font color="yellow">you shouldn't act big just because you work.</font>

275
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,728
<font color="yellow">Please take care of your own children.</font>

276
00:19:30,728 --> 00:19:33,088
<font color="yellow">What? Act big?</font>

277
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:51,328
<font color="yellow">These aren't food. You shouldn't eat them, okay?</font>

278
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:55,498
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't bite them or tear them, either.</font>

279
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,958
<font color="yellow">Just until I get back. Okay?</font>

280
00:20:00,188 --> 00:20:01,728
<font color="yellow">You're the best dog.</font>

281
00:20:02,498 --> 00:20:05,128
<font color="yellow">Where did you come from? Where's your mom?</font>

282
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,758
<font color="yellow">What about your dad?</font>

283
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:08,528
<font color="yellow">Where are they?</font>

284
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,658
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

285
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:15,328
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

286
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,258
<font color="yellow">All right. It's time for breakfast. There you go.</font>

287
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:28,428
<font color="yellow">I'm going to work. Be a good girl until I get back. Okay?</font>

288
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,258
<font color="yellow">Is it a girl?</font>

289
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:33,958
<font color="yellow">Yes. She's a girl.</font>

290
00:20:35,288 --> 00:20:36,288
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

291
00:20:37,228 --> 00:20:38,498
<font color="yellow">Aren't you going to work today?</font>

292
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,858
<font color="yellow">I am leaving now.</font>

293
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:44,498

<font color="yellow">Only then the girls will go "Honey!" and love you.</font>

307
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,688
<font color="yellow">- Is that right? - Of course.</font>

308
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:51,358
<font color="yellow">Right. Director Bang was asking me about signing the webtoon artist.</font>

309
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:53,928
<font color="yellow">Was she?</font>

310
00:21:57,328 --> 00:22:00,058
<font color="yellow">Wait. Please stop the car, Director Han.</font>

311
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:02,528
<font color="yellow">She looks like the sister of Seo Cheol Min.</font>

312
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,028
<font color="yellow">Wait, please stop the car. There is...</font>

313
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,588
<font color="yellow">Please stop. There's Seo Cheol Min's sister.</font>

314
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:08,688
<font color="yellow">Gosh!</font>

315
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:14,158
<font color="yellow">Darn it! Did you not see her?</font>

316
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:15,858
<font color="yellow">See what?</font>

317
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:18,688
<font color="yellow">I'm sure she was Seo Cheol Min's sister.</font>

318
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,728
<font color="yellow">That's impossible. You said we have a meeting. Let's hurry.</font>

319
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:43,788
<font color="yellow">We want to combine the strengths of viral marketing to...</font>

320
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,888
<font color="yellow">storytelling marketing and come up with our marketing concept.</font>

321
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,288
<font color="yellow">With a humane story contained in the product,</font>

322
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,188
<font color="yellow">you will capture the consumers' hearts.</font>

323
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:56,188
<font color="yellow">We will build trust so that those consumers will recommend...</font>

324
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:57,728
<font color="yellow">the product to the other consumers.</font>

325
00:22:58,888 --> 00:23:01,388
<font color="yellow">- It's good, Director Han. - Isn't it?</font>

326
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:05,328
<font color="yellow">As soon as I heard it, I thought it was a great idea.</font>

327
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,958
<font color="yellow">The Contents Team will develop the story that will...</font>

328
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:12,058
<font color="yellow">touch the hearts of the consumers. Based on that story,</font>

329
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,188
<font color="yellow">we will plan the marketing events for upcoming fall and winter season.</font>

330
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,788
<font color="yellow">I love the idea,</font>

331
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:19,758
<font color="yellow">but we have to plan and execute events frequently.</font>

332
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:21,888
<font color="yellow">We are already short of hands.</font>

333
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,958
<font color="yellow">You should hire an intern.</font>

334
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,728
<font color="yellow">If you're short of hands, ask for a new recruit.</font>

335
00:23:27,388 --> 00:23:28,758
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director Bang.</font>

336
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:32,388
<font color="yellow">She's always clear and delightful.</font>

337
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:35,088
<font color="yellow">What do you think, Producer Kim?</font>

338
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:39,788
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim?</font>

339
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,288
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim!</font>

340
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,428
<font color="yellow">Why are you so distracted during the meeting?</font>

341
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:45,428
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

342
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,458
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I am so sorry.</font>

343
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:54,628
<font color="yellow">I don't like everyone from the Contents Team.</font>

344
00:23:57,628 --> 00:23:59,358
<font color="yellow">Wait for me!</font>

345
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:02,128
<font color="yellow">I'm sure it was her.</font>

346
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:04,628
<font color="yellow">I saw her around Director Han's house.</font>

347
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:07,728
<font color="yellow">She was the sister of Seo Cheol Min, who we met in Taiwan.</font>

348
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,428
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you are mistaken.</font>

349
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,258
<font color="yellow">No! Gosh.</font>

350
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,888
<font color="yellow">Anyway, when are you leaving the office today?</font>

351
00:24:16,028 --> 00:24:17,158
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to know that?</font>

352
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:21,488
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go around the area near your house.</font>

353
00:24:23,058 --> 00:24:24,628
<font color="yellow">That's not necessary, is it?</font>

354
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:28,558
<font color="yellow">Never mind that. Producer Kim,</font>

355
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:30,128
<font color="yellow">can I speak to you in private?</font>

356
00:24:34,228 --> 00:24:37,458
<font color="yellow">What? Why would you pay for that?</font>

357
00:24:37,788 --> 00:24:40,188
<font color="yellow">I was the head of production of that drama.</font>

358
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:43,488
<font color="yellow">Also, I had the final say in hiring Cheol Min as the coordinator.</font>

359
00:24:44,528 --> 00:24:47,858
<font color="yellow">So I will make up for the company's loss with my own money.</font>

360
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:49,888
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't let it hassle many people.</font>

361
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,828
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

362
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,388
<font color="yellow">I feel bad enough that we're getting disciplinary actions and pay cuts.</font>

363
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,658
<font color="yellow">Why would you take all the blame at the last moment?</font>

364
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:02,658
<font color="yellow">I can catch her. I'm sure she was his little sister.</font>

365
00:25:03,188 --> 00:25:06,828
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I hope you will accept that and stop expanding this problem.</font>

366
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:09,758
<font color="yellow">I will tell the legal team, too.</font>

367
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:17,388
<font color="yellow">Director Han. Director Han!</font>

368
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,388
<font color="yellow">Yes, Seong Hoon.</font>

369
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,058
<font color="yellow">Are you doing well?</font>

370
00:25:32,988 --> 00:25:34,288
<font color="yellow">Yes, of course.</font>

371
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:38,428
<font color="yellow">I called to ask you something.</font>

372
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:42,288
<font color="yellow">By any chance, do you know Choi Jin Sung from...</font>

373
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,788
<font color="yellow">the Company Newsletter Team of LK Group?</font>

374
00:25:45,488 --> 00:25:47,428
<font color="yellow">Of course I know him. What about him?</font>

375
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:52,188
<font color="yellow">Someone introduced me to him. I am going for an interview.</font>

376
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,658
<font color="yellow">I see. I will find out more about him then.</font>

377
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,958
<font color="yellow">That would be nice.</font>

378
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:00,358
<font color="yellow">By the way, Seong Joon.</font>

379
00:26:01,428 --> 00:26:04,488
<font color="yellow">What do you think about my grandmother-in-law and...</font>

380
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:05,928
<font color="yellow">sister-in-law staying at our place?</font>

381
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:11,658
<font color="yellow">Seong Sik is making such a big fuss,</font>

382
00:26:11,928 --> 00:26:13,358
<font color="yellow">so I wondered if you were okay.</font>

383
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,958
<font color="yellow">I don't mind it.</font>

384
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:17,388
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about me.</font>

385
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,488
<font color="yellow">Thank you for saying that.</font>

386
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:24,658
<font color="yellow">My sister-in-law is...</font>

387
00:26:25,328 --> 00:26:29,128
<font color="yellow">around your age, so please treat her well.</font>

388
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,158
<font color="yellow">She's such a nice girl.</font>

389
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:32,988
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will do that.</font>

390
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:35,888
<font color="yellow">Go back to work then.</font>

391
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,958
<font color="yellow">- I'll see you later. - Okay.</font>

392
00:26:40,428 --> 00:26:41,558
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon!</font>

393
00:26:45,628 --> 00:26:48,088
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Shall we go on a date?</font>

394
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:57,528
<font color="yellow">The chef changed around six months after you left.</font>

395
00:26:58,188 --> 00:27:01,658
<font color="yellow">The ingredients of japchae and doenjang jjigae changed,</font>

396
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,628
<font color="yellow">but namool became even better.</font>

397
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:07,628
<font color="yellow">Try it.</font>

398
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:18,828
<font color="yellow">It's nice.</font>

399
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:21,488
<font color="yellow">You're quite difficult, you know?</font>

400
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:23,628
<font color="yellow">You like food that requires a lot of work.</font>

401
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:28,358
<font color="yellow">When you're married, your wife will be very tired. Right?</font>

402
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,788
<font color="yellow">I love that you're back.</font>

403
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:37,058
<font color="yellow">I wondered when I'd get to eat this with you again, and here we are.</font>

404
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:40,958
<font color="yellow">By the way, what did you talk about with Producer Kim?</font>

405
00:27:41,758 --> 00:27:42,788
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

406
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,528
<font color="yellow">What did you tell him when you talked to him in private?</font>

407
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:50,428
<font color="yellow">It was nothing. It was something personal.</font>

408
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:52,828
<font color="yellow">What was that personal thing?</font>

409
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:59,528
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - I am his boss.</font>

410
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:02,988
<font color="yellow">It will take me three seconds to find out if I call him.</font>

411
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,128
<font color="yellow">But I want to hear it from you.</font>

412
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:10,058
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you these days? Why did you become so secretive?</font>

413
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,428
<font color="yellow">I am not secretive. It's just that it's a very personal matter.</font>

414
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:16,228
<font color="yellow">So can't I know that personal thing?</font>

415
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:22,728
<font color="yellow">I suddenly feel cheap.</font>

416
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:24,558
<font color="yellow">Fine. I won't ask more.</font>

417
00:28:25,258 --> 00:28:28,288
<font color="yellow">But I am getting angry at you.</font>

418
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,128
<font color="yellow">What's this? You came back a long time ago,</font>

419
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:33,288
<font color="yellow">and it took us a long time to dine together.</font>

420
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,358
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're too mean?</font>

421
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,058
<font color="yellow">Am I? I apologize.</font>

422
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,828
<font color="yellow">But you know that I've been busy.</font>

423
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,988
<font color="yellow">I know. That's why I'm cutting you slack.</font>

424
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,788
<font color="yellow">I am just warning you that I can't do that any more.</font>

425
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:51,228
<font color="yellow">You know that, right? By the way, what will you do about that girl?</font>

426
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:54,928
<font color="yellow">I think the company will take the necessary measures.</font>

427
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,458
<font color="yellow">Isn't it okay if she pays back?</font>

428
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:03,158
<font color="yellow">I don't know about that. She still committed a crime.</font>

429
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:06,358
<font color="yellow">You seemed to be bothered with it,</font>

430
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:08,188
<font color="yellow">so I ordered the legal team myself.</font>

431
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,258
<font color="yellow">The legal team will take care of it now.</font>

432
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:14,328
<font color="yellow">Just pass the ball to them. Only then people like Mr. Park...</font>

433
00:29:14,358 --> 00:29:16,458
<font color="yellow">will stop picking on you and slandering you for no reason.</font>

434
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:20,658
<font color="yellow">It's bad for your promotion, too.</font>

435
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,758
<font color="yellow">Never mind. Don't get involved. It's my problem. I'll take care of it.</font>

436
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:25,258
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

437
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:34,158
<font color="yellow">It's a 24-hour gym. Thank you.</font>

438
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:36,788
<font color="yellow">It's a 24-hour gym.</font>

439
00:29:36,828 --> 00:29:38,628
<font color="yellow">It's a 24-hour gym.</font>

440
00:29:38,658 --> 00:29:41,458
<font color="yellow">It's a 24-hour gym. Thank you.</font>

441
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:52,088
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

442
00:30:13,128 --> 00:30:14,358
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Elizabeth?</font>

443
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:19,158
<font color="yellow">Let's go eat sujebi. I will treat you to celebrate your moving in.</font>

444
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:24,428
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Elizabeth?</font>

445
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,228
<font color="yellow">I'm fishing out pickled cucumbers.</font>

446
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,828
<font color="yellow">- Goodness! - They should've been fished out.</font>

447
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:36,488
<font color="yellow">Now they are all mushy and moldy. How will you eat this now?</font>

448
00:30:36,688 --> 00:30:40,428
<font color="yellow">Still, it's a shame to waste it. So I'm fishing out good ones.</font>

449
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:42,988
<font color="yellow">When did you make these pickled plums?</font>

450
00:30:43,128 --> 00:30:45,428
<font color="yellow">I did last summer.</font>

451
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:47,688
<font color="yellow">My cousin in Gwangyang sent me the plums.</font>

452
00:30:47,828 --> 00:30:50,758
<font color="yellow">Then you should've take them out in about three months.</font>

453
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:54,258
<font color="yellow">Now it's inedible since the toxin soaked out from the seeds.</font>

454
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:57,588
<font color="yellow">I took them out for now, so let's boil them tonight.</font>

455
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,728
<font color="yellow">Please leave them.</font>

456
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:03,428
<font color="yellow">If that has gone bad, let's just throw them away.</font>

457
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:05,658
<font color="yellow">Let's go out and eat sujebi with me.</font>

458
00:31:05,658 --> 00:31:07,428
<font color="yellow">You can't just throw them away.</font>

459
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:11,258
<font color="yellow">You put money and efforts to make these.</font>

460
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:14,728
<font color="yellow">You just need to be a little diligent.</font>

461
00:31:14,728 --> 00:31:18,758
<font color="yellow">I can't believe that nobody in such a big family takes care of this,</font>

462
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,488
<font color="yellow">and look how bad it's gone.</font>

463
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:24,188
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I am already well aware...</font>

464
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:27,228
<font color="yellow">that you served the feast when the Queen of England paid a visit.</font>

465
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:28,888
<font color="yellow">There you go again.</font>

466
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,428
<font color="yellow">- I'm just... - You still have...</font>

467
00:31:31,428 --> 00:31:34,028
<font color="yellow">the habit of stepping in every business.</font>

468
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,028
<font color="yellow">When did I do that?</font>

469
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,288
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember it?</font>

470
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,828
<font color="yellow">For Seong Hoon and Hye Joo's wedding,</font>

471
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:42,688
<font color="yellow">we had to use every means to reserve the famous hotel.</font>

472
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:46,258
<font color="yellow">Then, you stepped in all of a sudden...</font>

473
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:47,688
<font color="yellow">and cancelled the reservation.</font>

474
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,588
<font color="yellow">And you earned the sponsorship from Andong Hanok Village.</font>

475
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:54,128
<font color="yellow">I still can't believe that you came up with such idea back then.</font>

476
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:57,458
<font color="yellow">Anyway, because you decided to hold a traditional wedding,</font>

477
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,428
<font color="yellow">we had to run here and there to rent buses...</font>

478
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:03,628
<font color="yellow">and cancel the new suits to reorder hanbok.</font>

479
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:06,328
<font color="yellow">Moreover, Andong is really far from here.</font>

480
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:09,328
<font color="yellow">We stopped by three rest stops and got there.</font>

481
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:12,658
<font color="yellow">You prepared everything in the same way you did for the Queen...</font>

482
00:32:12,658 --> 00:32:15,428
<font color="yellow">and gave us a lecture on traditional courtesy.</font>

483
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:17,728
<font color="yellow">But we were really exhausted and starving.</font>

484
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,028
<font color="yellow">You know you went too far, don't you?</font>

485
00:32:21,258 --> 00:32:23,058
<font color="yellow">I wasn't the only one who went too far.</font>

486
00:32:23,388 --> 00:32:26,458
<font color="yellow">Your mother-in-law wore a dress like hanbok...</font>

487
00:32:26,458 --> 00:32:29,728
<font color="yellow">and bobbed around the hall...</font>

488
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:32,558
<font color="yellow">only to overturn the table. So we had to delay the wedding...</font>

489
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:35,528
<font color="yellow">for two hours to make all the food again.</font>

490
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,958
<font color="yellow">I imitated Grace Kelly...</font>

491
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,188
<font color="yellow">only because you imitated Queen Elizabeth.</font>

492
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:43,688
<font color="yellow">No one cares what old ladies like us wear.</font>

493
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:44,988
<font color="yellow">Pardon me?</font>

494
00:32:46,928 --> 00:32:50,428
<font color="yellow">Please stop and let's just go have some sujebi.</font>

495
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:54,058
<font color="yellow">I'm in the middle of working. I have to finish it.</font>

496
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,428
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

497
00:32:56,828 --> 00:33:00,688
<font color="yellow">What a waste. My goodness.</font>

498
00:33:01,728 --> 00:33:02,958
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

499
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,858
<font color="yellow">She's full of inferiority complex.</font>

500
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,158
<font color="yellow">How stubborn.</font>

501
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:20,358
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, didn't you say you'll go out for lunch?</font>

502
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,858
<font color="yellow">I will. Jeong Eun, let's go out to have lunch.</font>

503
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:26,088
<font color="yellow">Where's that little girl?</font>

504
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:28,688
<font color="yellow">She just said she's going out.</font>

505
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,988
<font color="yellow">Where did she go?</font>

506
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:35,858
<font color="yellow">I saw a gap there. I need you to measure it before you resume.</font>

507
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,528
<font color="yellow">- Please check the other side, too. - Okay.</font>

508
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:41,428
<font color="yellow">And the marble wall must be flawless.</font>

509
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:43,388
<font color="yellow">I need you to check...</font>

510
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,328
<font color="yellow">- if it has any cracks on it. - Okay.</font>

511
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,788
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you begun the third floor's reinforcement work?</font>

512
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:49,088
<font color="yellow">Didn't the subcontractor call you yet?</font>

513
00:33:50,088 --> 00:33:52,088
<font color="yellow">- I'll contact them right away. - Okay.</font>

514
00:33:52,688 --> 00:33:54,658
<font color="yellow">Tell them if they don't come here by this afternoon,</font>

515
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,958
<font color="yellow">- I'll nullify the contract. - I will.</font>

516
00:33:57,028 --> 00:33:58,028
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

517
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:05,398
<font color="yellow">How could you just walk away like that?</font>

518
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:09,428
<font color="yellow">- Is that why you're here? - Yes, that's why I'm here.</font>

519
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:13,328
<font color="yellow">It might be nothing to you, but it's really important to me.</font>

520
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:16,828
<font color="yellow">You said you'll give it back. Why did you just go home that way?</font>

521
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,788
<font color="yellow">Come to my place by 7pm, then I'll give you back.</font>

522
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:21,788
<font color="yellow">By when?</font>

523
00:34:22,758 --> 00:34:25,088
<font color="yellow">- By 7pm. - Fine.</font>

524
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:27,528
<font color="yellow">You must return it, okay?</font>

525
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,088
<font color="yellow">Please leave. I'm busy now.</font>

526
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,658
<font color="yellow">Do you think I'm not busy?</font>

527
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,528
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

528
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:41,088
<font color="yellow">what happened to your company?</font>

529
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:46,258
<font color="yellow">Just out of curiosity,</font>

530
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:50,528
<font color="yellow">did your business fail?</font>

531
00:34:57,488 --> 00:35:00,988
<font color="yellow">You're rich enough to buy a country. Why are you working here?</font>

532
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:03,858
<font color="yellow">I guess it really went bust.</font>

533
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:07,428
<font color="yellow">I heard that investment firms undergo ups and downs every day.</font>

534
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,258
<font color="yellow">Still...</font>

535
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:12,558
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you ended up here.</font>

536
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:16,728
<font color="yellow">I don't know who you are talking about from last night.</font>

537
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,898
<font color="yellow">David Lee of Golden Street in New York.</font>

538
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,398
<font color="yellow">That's not me. You've got the wrong person.</font>

539
00:35:23,428 --> 00:35:26,358
<font color="yellow">No, it's you. You know I have a great memory.</font>

540
00:35:26,588 --> 00:35:29,358
<font color="yellow">Didn't the police contact you? They caught the thief, right?</font>

541
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,628
<font color="yellow">Anyway, we'll talk about it later.</font>

542
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:38,858
<font color="yellow">You must give my things back to me tonight, okay?</font>

543
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,058
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

544
00:35:58,328 --> 00:35:59,398
<font color="yellow">I checked.</font>

545
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:02,828
<font color="yellow">It's true that she worked at Carnival Sandwich.</font>

546
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,428
<font color="yellow">She worked from November of 2013 to February of 2014.</font>

547
00:36:05,988 --> 00:36:09,258
<font color="yellow">It's her friend's store, and her name is Han Jeong Eun.</font>

548
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:21,358
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

549
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,988
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

550
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:28,788
<font color="yellow">I rather spend the time singing</font>

551
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:31,228
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

552
00:36:31,428 --> 00:36:33,758
<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

553
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:49,188
<font color="yellow">Why haven't you been around these days?</font>

554
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:52,528
<font color="yellow">No, I haven't. I just skipped few days.</font>

555
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:53,758
<font color="yellow">Did you fall ill?</font>

556
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:55,158
<font color="yellow">I didn't.</font>

557
00:36:55,228 --> 00:36:56,928
<font color="yellow">But you don't look well.</font>

558
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:59,528
<font color="yellow">What's the matter? What's biting you?</font>

559
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:03,088
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with all of you? I'm just fine. I have no worries.</font>

560
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:06,588
<font color="yellow">I just skipped few days because I was tired.</font>

561
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,288
<font color="yellow">Goodness, fine.</font>

562
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:11,628
<font color="yellow">I'll buy you lunch for Jeong Ae with such a long face.</font>

563
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:12,828
<font color="yellow">- Seriously? - Really?</font>

564
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:14,088
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

565
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:15,588
<font color="yellow">Let's eat pork ribs.</font>

566
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:18,158
<font color="yellow">- That sounds great. - What a good idea.</font>

567
00:37:18,158 --> 00:37:21,358
<font color="yellow">I said I'm totally fine. I don't need pork ribs.</font>

568
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:24,328
<font color="yellow">If you feel that bad, you can buy us some coffee, then.</font>

569
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,858
<font color="yellow">Shall we go to Jeong Ae's house to have some coffee, then?</font>

570
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,028
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - To my house?</font>

571
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:33,788
<font color="yellow">Yes. It's been a while since my last visit.</font>

572
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:36,558
<font color="yellow">You can't. My mother-in-law is at home.</font>

573
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,828
<font color="yellow">Isn't she living on the third floor?</font>

574
00:37:39,328 --> 00:37:40,928
<font color="yellow">What? Well...</font>

575
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,758
<font color="yellow">I have to make lunch for my husband.</font>

576
00:37:43,758 --> 00:37:45,758
<font color="yellow">I saw him go mountaineering earlier today.</font>

577
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:47,728
<font color="yellow">Not today, okay?</font>

578
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,558
<font color="yellow">Let's have lunch later. I'm leaving.</font>

579
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:52,828
<font color="yellow">What's with her?</font>

580
00:37:52,858 --> 00:37:54,758
<font color="yellow">She's so weird.</font>

581
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,688
<font color="yellow">She is so strange.</font>

582
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:02,428
<font color="yellow">Why does she want to buy me lunch out of the blue?</font>

583
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,558
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

584
00:38:05,428 --> 00:38:06,758
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jeong Ae!</font>

585
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:09,628
<font color="yellow">I know Jeong Eun is back. I need you to pay her tab.</font>

586
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:10,688
<font color="yellow">What tab?</font>

587
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,558
<font color="yellow">She took liquors several times.</font>

588
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:14,688
<font color="yellow">Why are you asking me to pay it back?</font>

589
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,588
<font color="yellow">She's almost like your daughter.</font>

590
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,328
<font color="yellow">She's not my daughter.</font>

591
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,398
<font color="yellow">Do you think my house is a shelter for people in need?</font>

592
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:24,528
<font color="yellow">Why am I always the one who should take care of everyone?</font>

593
00:38:24,528 --> 00:38:26,488
<font color="yellow">I have no money. Ask her mom to pay back!</font>

594
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,988
<font color="yellow">Why on earth is she so mad?</font>

595
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:41,588
<font color="yellow">Why does everyone around me annoy me?</font>

596
00:38:41,788 --> 00:38:43,328
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae!</font>

597
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,398
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae!</font>

598
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,088
<font color="yellow">Gosh, why...</font>

599
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:50,958
<font color="yellow">- Why are you here? - What do you mean?</font>

600
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:54,228
<font color="yellow">- We can't have lunch without you. - She's right.</font>

601
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:57,088
<font color="yellow">So we brought jokbal to eat together.</font>

602
00:38:57,128 --> 00:38:58,758
<font color="yellow">You like jokbal, right?</font>

603
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:01,288
<font color="yellow">Of course, she does. Let's eat jokbal and drink coffee.</font>

604
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:04,088
<font color="yellow">That sounds good. We haven't had lunch for a while.</font>

605
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,488
<font color="yellow">- Then, let's go in. - Wait. Wait.</font>

606
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:08,858
<font color="yellow">Why do you want to come into my house?</font>

607
00:39:08,858 --> 00:39:10,788
<font color="yellow">That's where we always hang out.</font>

608
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:12,558
<font color="yellow">Hold on. Don't you have to go work today?</font>

609
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,658
<font color="yellow">It's Thursday, my day off.</font>

610
00:39:14,658 --> 00:39:16,728
<font color="yellow">- There's a part time doctor. - Let's go in.</font>

611
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:18,588
<font color="yellow">Wait a second. Gosh.</font>

612
00:39:18,628 --> 00:39:20,058
<font color="yellow">Let's go inside.</font>

613
00:39:21,328 --> 00:39:23,688
<font color="yellow">My husband will come home shortly.</font>

614
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,988
<font color="yellow">We'll leave right after we finish jokbal.</font>

615
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:28,958
<font color="yellow">Do not underestimate mountaineering.</font>

616
00:39:28,988 --> 00:39:32,228
<font color="yellow">You know it takes longer to climb down a mountain.</font>

617
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:34,428
<font color="yellow">- Let's go in. - Let's go inside.</font>

618
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:37,458
<font color="yellow">- I want coffee first. - Wait here.</font>

619
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,128
<font color="yellow">I'll boil the water and bring some plates.</font>

620
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:40,488
<font color="yellow">Stay there.</font>

621
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:48,358
<font color="yellow">Why... Why are you here?</font>

622
00:39:49,128 --> 00:39:50,188
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

623
00:39:51,328 --> 00:39:53,158
<font color="yellow">I ran out of ramyeon and coffee.</font>

624
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:57,328
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Reporter Han Seong Hoon.</font>

625
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,128
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

626
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:07,688
<font color="yellow">Goodness, you're not working?</font>

627
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:20,788
<font color="yellow">I do not usually shop in places like this.</font>

628
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:22,428
<font color="yellow">But...</font>

629
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:25,028
<font color="yellow">I came to see if you have...</font>

630
00:40:25,628 --> 00:40:27,828
<font color="yellow">balsamic vinegar and anchovies.</font>

631
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:30,958
<font color="yellow">Professor,</font>

632
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:35,988
<font color="yellow">we do have neither balsamic vinegar nor anchovies,</font>

633
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:38,988
<font color="yellow">but I need you to pay your daughter's tab!</font>

634
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:42,328
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - You need to pay her tab.</font>

635
00:40:42,658 --> 00:40:45,358
<font color="yellow">Jeong Eun put a box of soju and beer...</font>

636
00:40:45,588 --> 00:40:47,358
<font color="yellow">on her tab.</font>

637
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,988
<font color="yellow">Aren't you Jeong Eun's mother?</font>

638
00:40:56,128 --> 00:40:58,928
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - I heard she is back.</font>

639
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:02,958
<font color="yellow">Did you see my daughter?</font>

640
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,928
<font color="yellow">I saw her just the other day at the police station.</font>

641
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:09,358
<font color="yellow">Again? Was she at the station?</font>

642
00:41:10,328 --> 00:41:12,058
<font color="yellow">Ring these up please. How much?</font>

643
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:30,358
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

644
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:33,588
<font color="yellow">Aunt.</font>

645
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:36,128
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

646
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,988
<font color="yellow">Why did you open my refrigerator?</font>

647
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:42,658
<font color="yellow">Nothing.</font>

648
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:55,658
<font color="yellow">Food poisoning bacteria was found in snacks produced from a conglomerate.</font>

649
00:41:56,028 --> 00:41:58,428
<font color="yellow">What are your thoughts on this, Mr. Han?</font>

650
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:02,488
<font color="yellow">- Long time ago, there were... - What are you eating?</font>

651
00:42:02,488 --> 00:42:04,988
<font color="yellow">- a lot of junk foods... - I'm eating cheese sticks.</font>

652
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:06,658
<font color="yellow">You had dinner already.</font>

653
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,728
<font color="yellow">I was feeling slightly hungry.</font>

654
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:21,758
<font color="yellow">Darn it.</font>

655
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:26,128
<font color="yellow">- Mr. Han, please calm down. - Yes, please.</font>

656
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:31,158
<font color="yellow">This snack was known to be organic.</font>

657
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:34,628
<font color="yellow">The company emphasized it was organic which customers prefer.</font>

658
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:37,788
<font color="yellow">Yes, it's true. This is also a problem</font>

659
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,728
<font color="yellow">Because everyone is making a fuss about organic food lately,</font>

660
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:43,428
<font color="yellow">there are people who are trying to take advantage of this.</font>

661
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:45,928
<font color="yellow">The best way to approach this problem is...</font>

662
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:50,028
<font color="yellow">to farm one's own food on the rooftop just like my grandmother.</font>

663
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:52,828
<font color="yellow">We all should farm the food that we'll consume.</font>

664
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:54,588
<font color="yellow">This is by far the best way to go.</font>

665
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:58,128
<font color="yellow">Anyway, anyone who's playing with food...</font>

666
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:02,628
<font color="yellow">will have to face severe punishment. That's my thought.</font>

667
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,988
<font color="yellow">Thank you for your opinion.</font>

668
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:09,188
<font color="yellow">So your grandmother has a farm on her rooftop?</font>

669
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:10,658
<font color="yellow">You're welcome to visit.</font>

670
00:43:12,488 --> 00:43:13,528
<font color="yellow">I don't think so.</font>

671
00:43:16,028 --> 00:43:18,628
<font color="yellow">In "Today's Current Event", we discussed about...</font>

672
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:21,398
<font color="yellow">the reality of junk food.</font>

673
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:25,588
<font color="yellow">We'll be back tomorrow with a different topic to discuss.</font>

674
00:43:25,898 --> 00:43:29,488
<font color="yellow">- This was Jang Yoo Ra. - And Park Bong Seok.</font>

675
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:33,988
<font color="yellow">("Today's Current Event")</font>

676
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:35,988
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Good job, everyone.</font>

677
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:39,058
<font color="yellow">- Well done. - Good job.</font>

678
00:43:50,288 --> 00:43:52,328
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Ms. Jang.</font>

679
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,588
<font color="yellow">Why don't we have a meal?</font>

680
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:56,658
<font color="yellow">I have plans.</font>

681
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:58,858
<font color="yellow">Don't be like that.</font>

682
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:01,488
<font color="yellow">Why is it so hard to have a meal with you?</font>

683
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:05,188
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang.</font>

684
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:08,888
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang. I'll treat you with something expensive.</font>

685
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:15,658
<font color="yellow">Grandpa, when is Mom coming home?</font>

686
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:17,158
<font color="yellow">She'll be here soon.</font>

687
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,788
<font color="yellow">Play with your brother.</font>

688
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:24,758
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, stop eating.</font>

689
00:44:25,658 --> 00:44:27,728
<font color="yellow">You're going to sleep soon. Why are you still eating?</font>

690
00:44:29,288 --> 00:44:32,158
<font color="yellow">- This will be the last piece. - Goodness.</font>

691
00:44:45,258 --> 00:44:46,988
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you now?</font>

692
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:49,058
<font color="yellow">Did something happen today?</font>

693
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,028
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo. Ah In. I'm home.</font>

694
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:59,288
<font color="yellow">Did you eat? I'll cook your dinner.</font>

695
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:00,728
<font color="yellow">Today,</font>

696
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:03,558
<font color="yellow">they ate dinner at Father's.</font>

697
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:06,188
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

698
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:09,958
<font color="yellow">I cooked bulgogi for them.</font>

699
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:13,258
<font color="yellow">- Why did you do that? - Father...</font>

700
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:16,488
<font color="yellow">wanted to feed them dinner. How could I ignore his wish?</font>

701
00:45:16,628 --> 00:45:18,358
<font color="yellow">I had to drive Ji Hoon to his academy,</font>

702
00:45:18,428 --> 00:45:20,688
<font color="yellow">but I told him to get a cab.</font>

703
00:45:20,828 --> 00:45:24,328
<font color="yellow">I cooked bulgogi and japchae, and sent the food upstairs with them.</font>

704
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:27,728
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook, did I eat the food?</font>

705
00:45:27,988 --> 00:45:30,658
<font color="yellow">- Why are you blaming it on me? - Hye Joo.</font>

706
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:33,358
<font color="yellow">Can't you come home early?</font>

707
00:45:33,658 --> 00:45:36,188
<font color="yellow">Because you always come home after dinner,</font>

708
00:45:36,288 --> 00:45:40,128
<font color="yellow">I have to cook dinner for everyone in this building.</font>

709
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:42,088
<font color="yellow">Are you picking a fight with me because I come home late?</font>

710
00:45:42,888 --> 00:45:46,028
<font color="yellow">Then don't cook dinner for everyone in this building.</font>

711
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:48,728
<font color="yellow">How could I when Father is trying to feed them dinner?</font>

712
00:45:48,828 --> 00:45:50,588
<font color="yellow">How can I pretend not to see what's happening?</font>

713
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,828
<font color="yellow">If you can't pretend, then remind yourself of your first intention.</font>

714
00:46:03,828 --> 00:46:04,858
<font color="yellow">My first intention?</font>

715
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:08,358
<font color="yellow">You moved in to take care of Father.</font>

716
00:46:08,528 --> 00:46:10,258
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

717
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:12,788
<font color="yellow">when Father's trying to cook dinner,</font>

718
00:46:12,928 --> 00:46:16,988
<font color="yellow">how can you not help him and take care of him?</font>

719
00:46:19,288 --> 00:46:20,558
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

720
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:23,688
<font color="yellow">Did you just grab me?</font>

721
00:46:24,758 --> 00:46:27,028
<font color="yellow">- Are you trying to hurt me? - I said...</font>

722
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:29,928
<font color="yellow">I was going to take care of Father.</font>

723
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,258
<font color="yellow">When did I say I was going to take care of your family?</font>

724
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:34,788
<font color="yellow">So what?</font>

725
00:46:35,828 --> 00:46:39,388
<font color="yellow">Do you want to have a fight then? Fine. Let's go.</font>

726
00:46:41,788 --> 00:46:43,888
<font color="yellow">Why is it hard to have dinner with her?</font>

727
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:47,128
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

728
00:46:47,258 --> 00:46:49,258
<font color="yellow">Why are you screaming in my house?</font>

729
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:52,228
<font color="yellow">Honey, what's going on?</font>

730
00:46:52,628 --> 00:46:54,958
<font color="yellow">Hey, is this your house?</font>

731
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:56,528
<font color="yellow">Is it yours?</font>

732
00:46:56,988 --> 00:46:59,358
<font color="yellow">This house belongs to Father.</font>

733
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:01,458
<font color="yellow">You're sly like a fox.</font>

734
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,388
<font color="yellow">You only moved in a month ago.</font>

735
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:06,528
<font color="yellow">How can you say this is your house?</font>

736
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,258
<font color="yellow">Why don't you go ahead and hit me?</font>

737
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:13,028
<font color="yellow">- You started this, not me. - My goodness.</font>

738
00:47:14,158 --> 00:47:17,258
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. How could you act this way?</font>

739
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:21,488
<font color="yellow">Even though she used to work for you,</font>

740
00:47:21,688 --> 00:47:25,188
<font color="yellow">you can't treat her the same way as you did before.</font>

741
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:27,028
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - My goodness.</font>

742
00:47:27,028 --> 00:47:29,158
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk down to me?</font>

743
00:47:29,328 --> 00:47:31,658
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, don't do this.</font>

744
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:34,988
<font color="yellow">Even though he was in junior class at your college,</font>

745
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:37,188
<font color="yellow">you can't boss us around.</font>

746
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,958
<font color="yellow">He is your brother-in-law.</font>

747
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:42,128
<font color="yellow">- What are you talking about? - Everyone, be quiet.</font>

748
00:47:44,388 --> 00:47:45,388
<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

749
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:48,188
<font color="yellow">- What happened, honey? - Seong Hoon.</font>

750
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,358
<font color="yellow">I told you not to wear this.</font>

751
00:47:53,088 --> 00:47:55,888
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. I'm not on TV.</font>

752
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:59,328
<font color="yellow">You can wear your fancy clothes at home all you want.</font>

753
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:02,088
<font color="yellow">By the way, why are you here?</font>

754
00:48:02,558 --> 00:48:05,188
<font color="yellow">I'm stressed out from my show.</font>

755
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:07,588
<font color="yellow">Your show is all you talk about.</font>

756
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:12,528
<font color="yellow">If you can appear on TV, everyone in Korea can.</font>

757
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:14,688
<font color="yellow">Not you.</font>

758
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,888
<font color="yellow">- You are not on TV. - What did you say?</font>

759
00:48:18,728 --> 00:48:21,588
<font color="yellow">Look at you. You call yourself as a political commentator,</font>

760
00:48:21,588 --> 00:48:25,558
<font color="yellow">but all you do is going after the higher authorities.</font>

761
00:48:25,688 --> 00:48:27,458
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

762
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,128
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

763
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:32,088
<font color="yellow">I'm still on TV.</font>

764
00:48:32,258 --> 00:48:34,358
<font color="yellow">But you got laid off from your company...</font>

765
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:36,788
<font color="yellow">- and I still have a house. - What?</font>

766
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:39,828
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Honey.</font>

767
00:48:40,288 --> 00:48:42,458
<font color="yellow">- What did you just say? - What?</font>

768
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,758
<font color="yellow">I didn't say anything wrong.</font>

769
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:47,128
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, you need to cook for your children.</font>

770
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:49,688
<font color="yellow">It's not like I am not cooking for them purposely.</font>

771
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:52,358
<font color="yellow">I just had a bad timing.</font>

772
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:54,988
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

773
00:48:56,288 --> 00:48:57,328
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

774
00:48:57,328 --> 00:49:00,458
<font color="yellow">You should be ashamed of living in your parents' house.</font>

775
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:02,128
<font color="yellow">Look who's talking.</font>

776
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,988
<font color="yellow">You moved in, too.</font>

777
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,328
<font color="yellow">Please, let's not get into each other's business.</font>

778
00:49:07,758 --> 00:49:09,588
<font color="yellow">I want to do the same, too.</font>

779
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:12,188
<font color="yellow">Do you think this is comfortable for us to live with you?</font>

780
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:14,028
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

781
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:18,088
<font color="yellow">I'm going to kill them.</font>

782
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,028
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

783
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:28,288
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't have belittled me first.</font>

784
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:30,128
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Let's stop it here.</font>

785
00:49:30,158 --> 00:49:32,188
<font color="yellow">Don't you ever talk to me again.</font>

786
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:35,358
<font color="yellow">- Right back at you. - What did you say?</font>

787
00:49:35,588 --> 00:49:38,128
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

788
00:49:39,858 --> 00:49:42,328
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Mother.</font>

789
00:49:42,328 --> 00:49:43,388
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Mother.</font>

790
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:45,658
<font color="yellow">All of you. Come upstairs.</font>

791
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,388
<font color="yellow">How old are you all?</font>

792
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:01,728
<font color="yellow">Are you the same age as Chang Soo or Ji Hoon?</font>

793
00:50:01,888 --> 00:50:04,158
<font color="yellow">You are all in your 40s.</font>

794
00:50:04,158 --> 00:50:07,288
<font color="yellow">If you moved into your parents' house, you should know your place.</font>

795
00:50:07,288 --> 00:50:08,988
<font color="yellow">How can you fight and make a fuss?</font>

796
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:12,558
<font color="yellow">I'm so embarrassed by you all. I can't lift my head up around...</font>

797
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:16,528
<font color="yellow">- in this neighborhood. - Mom.</font>

798
00:50:17,388 --> 00:50:18,858
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo hit me.</font>

799
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:22,158
<font color="yellow">Why did you hit my son?</font>

800
00:50:22,358 --> 00:50:23,428
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

801
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:26,888
<font color="yellow">I didn't hit him.</font>

802
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:28,988
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

803
00:50:29,758 --> 00:50:31,028
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

804
00:50:31,388 --> 00:50:34,488
<font color="yellow">- You hit me like this a while ago. - Be quiet.</font>

805
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:40,388
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mom.</font>

806
00:50:41,428 --> 00:50:44,288
<font color="yellow">We had a little disagreement of opinions,</font>

807
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,958
<font color="yellow">but we will resolve it within today.</font>

808
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:50,028
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry.</font>

809
00:50:50,028 --> 00:50:51,088
<font color="yellow">Don't...</font>

810
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:53,588
<font color="yellow">say a word.</font>

811
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,158
<font color="yellow">My heart broke today...</font>

812
00:50:55,288 --> 00:50:57,558
<font color="yellow">because of you.</font>

813
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:02,328
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon. Did something happen?</font>

814
00:51:04,188 --> 00:51:05,428
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

815
00:51:05,788 --> 00:51:07,488
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Mother.</font>

816
00:51:08,628 --> 00:51:13,228
<font color="yellow">Actually, since we're living in the same house,</font>

817
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:15,428
<font color="yellow">it's hard to separate our private life.</font>

818
00:51:15,528 --> 00:51:17,458
<font color="yellow">- Your private life? - Yes.</font>

819
00:51:18,258 --> 00:51:20,888
<font color="yellow">That's right. It's good that you brought that up.</font>

820
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:25,228
<font color="yellow">I actually wanted to talk to you about it.</font>

821
00:51:26,728 --> 00:51:29,288
<font color="yellow">You've already moved in.</font>

822
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:32,688
<font color="yellow">There's nothing we can do about it.</font>

823
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,158
<font color="yellow">But from now on, we should...</font>

824
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,428
<font color="yellow">keep our private life separate.</font>

825
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:43,928
<font color="yellow">- Pardon? - You should...</font>

826
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:45,728
<font color="yellow">pay rent.</font>

827
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:47,188
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

828
00:51:49,028 --> 00:51:50,358
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - Mother.</font>

829
00:51:50,388 --> 00:51:52,658
<font color="yellow">It's not just rent. Pay for the electric bill, too.</font>

830
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:54,888
<font color="yellow">- Mom. - The water bill, gas bill,</font>

831
00:51:55,228 --> 00:51:56,928
<font color="yellow">and even the sewer bill, too.</font>

832
00:51:58,228 --> 00:52:01,358
<font color="yellow">How could you move in to leech off of your old parents,</font>

833
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:03,628
<font color="yellow">and live without paying us any money?</font>

834
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:09,088
<font color="yellow">Who took two onions from my fridge earlier?</font>

835
00:52:09,188 --> 00:52:11,158
<font color="yellow">Mother. That's...</font>

836
00:52:11,158 --> 00:52:12,858
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make Father bulgogi.</font>

837
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:15,358
<font color="yellow">Put two onions back in my fridge.</font>

838
00:52:16,288 --> 00:52:18,758
<font color="yellow">Mother. I used them to cook Father...</font>

839
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:20,958
<font color="yellow">He's your father-in-law, not mine.</font>

840
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:25,458
<font color="yellow">Also, you moved in on the 30th.</font>

841
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:27,828
<font color="yellow">I'll be collecting rent.</font>

842
00:52:28,788 --> 00:52:30,428
<font color="yellow">Mom... Mom.</font>

843
00:52:31,028 --> 00:52:33,858
<font color="yellow">No. Mom, no.</font>

844
00:52:34,088 --> 00:52:36,528
<font color="yellow">You can't do that. Please don't do that.</font>

845
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,688
<font color="yellow">Mom. You can't do this to us!</font>

846
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:43,928
<font color="yellow">Mom! I can never do that! Never!</font>

847
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,088
<font color="yellow">This is absurd!</font>

848
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:48,188
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? Mom! - Mother.</font>

849
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:51,128
<font color="yellow">- Mother. That may be too much. - Mom.</font>

850
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,288
<font color="yellow">I can't do that!</font>

851
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:55,888
<font color="yellow">Do whatever you want to do. I just can't!</font>

852
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:57,688
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

853
00:53:09,558 --> 00:53:12,188
<font color="yellow">He told me to come. Why isn't he answering?</font>

854
00:53:23,028 --> 00:53:24,228
<font color="yellow">I found it.</font>

855
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,358
<font color="yellow">- Are you sure? - I'm sure this time.</font>

856
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:36,228
<font color="yellow">How long is he going to keep me waiting?</font>

857
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:38,058
<font color="yellow">Isn't he home?</font>

858
00:53:38,728 --> 00:53:39,888
<font color="yellow">Let's calm down.</font>

859
00:53:40,388 --> 00:53:41,928
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

860
00:53:42,158 --> 00:53:43,428
<font color="yellow">Calm down.</font>

861
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:46,728
<font color="yellow">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

862
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:49,758
<font color="yellow">Give me my necklace and toiletries! Where are you going?</font>

863
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,358
<font color="yellow">We're here.</font>

864
00:54:10,228 --> 00:54:12,158
<font color="yellow">You look tired. Go inside and get some rest.</font>

865
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:16,788
<font color="yellow">What is it, Mi Joo?</font>

866
00:54:18,128 --> 00:54:19,788
<font color="yellow">Don't you know what's wrong?</font>

867
00:54:21,288 --> 00:54:22,958
<font color="yellow">How could you do this?</font>

868
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:25,958
<font color="yellow">I thought you'd be different once you come back to Korea.</font>

869
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:28,628
<font color="yellow">How long should I wait?</font>

870
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:32,588
<font color="yellow">You came back from Shanghai, but you haven't changed at all.</font>

871
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:35,958
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - We've been dating for five years.</font>

872
00:54:36,288 --> 00:54:38,828
<font color="yellow">It was 3 years before you went to Shanghai, and 2 years after.</font>

873
00:54:39,328 --> 00:54:42,328
<font color="yellow">We didn't exactly say that we were in a relationship,</font>

874
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:44,688
<font color="yellow">but we spent time together while working.</font>

875
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:47,288
<font color="yellow">That made us share a special relationship.</font>

876
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:50,328
<font color="yellow">Above all,</font>

877
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:53,788
<font color="yellow">you must've known about my feelings during all those times.</font>

878
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:57,028
<font color="yellow">It's been frustrating and upsetting,</font>

879
00:54:57,158 --> 00:54:59,088
<font color="yellow">but the reason why I could bear it was...</font>

880
00:55:00,488 --> 00:55:02,888
<font color="yellow">because you never pushed me aside.</font>

881
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:06,258
<font color="yellow">We had meals, drank tea,</font>

882
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:08,128
<font color="yellow">watched movies, and went skiing.</font>

883
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:12,158
<font color="yellow">When I went to Shanghai, you always escorted me.</font>

884
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:15,258
<font color="yellow">- Mi Joo. - Why did you push me aside today?</font>

885
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:17,358
<font color="yellow">When we were talking about Cheol Min's sister,</font>

886
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,328
<font color="yellow">you said things like, "Never mind", "It's my problem", and all.</font>

887
00:55:22,288 --> 00:55:23,458
<font color="yellow">What did you mean by that?</font>

888
00:55:24,928 --> 00:55:26,088
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry,</font>

889
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:28,288
<font color="yellow">but that's not what I meant.</font>

890
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,028
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

891
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:35,988
<font color="yellow">I can't stand this any more.</font>

892
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:38,458
<font color="yellow">Let's get married.</font>

893
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:12,388
<font color="yellow">I gave out all the flyers.</font>

894
00:56:13,158 --> 00:56:16,988
<font color="yellow">Then why would they be inside the trash can near the subway station?</font>

895
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:18,758
<font color="yellow">Because of people like you,</font>

896
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:21,328
<font color="yellow">I can't trust anyone with the flyers. Do you know that?</font>

897
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,858
<font color="yellow">No, Sir. I really gave out all of them.</font>

898
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:25,858
<font color="yellow">Please believe me.</font>

899
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:29,158
<font color="yellow">Some people take it and just put it in the trash,</font>

900
00:56:29,158 --> 00:56:31,628
<font color="yellow">but you can't blame me for that.</font>

901
00:56:31,628 --> 00:56:33,058
<font color="yellow">How should I know...</font>

902
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:35,188
<font color="yellow">if you really gave them out, or just killed time...</font>

903
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:37,088
<font color="yellow">and shoved them in the trash?</font>

904
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:40,158
<font color="yellow">No. I didn't do that.</font>

905
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:42,558
<font color="yellow">Please believe me.</font>

906
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:46,758
<font color="yellow">I stood for six straight hours to give out those flyers.</font>
