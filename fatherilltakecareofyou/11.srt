00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:22,061
<font color="yellow">Is something wrong? Are you feeling bad?</font>

<font color="yellow">What's wrong?</font>

00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:33,571
<font color="yellow">It's because of Mona Lisa, isn't it?</font>

16
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,141
<font color="yellow">I said the logo's color is darker by one tone and it's not clear.</font>

17

<font color="yellow">You should fix it immediately.</font>

18
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,541

00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:19,968
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

23
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:23,398
<font color="yellow">Hey! Do you want to die?</font>

24

31
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,028
<font color="yellow">It's one week past your due date. Do you know that?</font>

32
00:01:54,798 --> 00:01:56,128
<font color="yellow">Has it passed already?</font>

33
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:03,128
<font color="yellow">I am sorry,</font>

34
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:07,598
<font color="yellow">but I am really busy right now. Can I go next week?</font>

35
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,828
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes. I have an important meeting after work.</font>

36
00:02:13,828 --> 00:02:16,868
<font color="yellow">I will go right after the meeting.</font>

37

<font color="yellow">The back pain indicates that it will get more active soon.</font>

45
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:45,768
<font color="yellow">Therefore, it's estimated that I will give birth...</font>

<font color="yellow">I called my husband on the way.</font>

49
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:58,198
<font color="yellow">He must be coming here from the conference.</font>

50

<font color="yellow">Yes, Ms. Kim.</font>

51
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:03,828
<font color="yellow">I came to give birth right now.</font>

52
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:07,898
<font color="yellow">Why does it suddenly hurt?</font>

53
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,098
<font color="yellow">Yes. We have to send the experiment results of...</font>

<font color="yellow">I will try my best to be as quick as possible.</font>

61
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:31,698
<font color="yellow">So work hard while I'm away. Bye.</font>

63
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:40,568

<font color="yellow">Just 20 days ago,</font>

88
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:48,428
<font color="yellow">I did the medical checkup...</font>

90

<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon and Chang Soo came.</font>

91
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,298

<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - No problem.</font>

97
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,838
<font color="yellow">I was...</font>

98
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:21,598
<font color="yellow">worried about Ji Hoon's health.</font>

99
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,368
<font color="yellow">So I was checking his result.</font>

100
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,268
<font color="yellow">It turned out Ji Hoon's blood type was O.</font>

101

<font color="yellow">I know Hee Sook's blood type.</font>

105

<font color="yellow">As you know, a child with blood type O...</font>

106

<font color="yellow">Then? What happened?</font>

108

<font color="yellow">Here's the result for Han Chang Soo.</font>

109

<font color="yellow">However, Chang Soo's...</font>

110

<font color="yellow">blood type turns out to be B.</font>

111
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:06,068
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

112
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:09,128
<font color="yellow">What? I mean...</font>

113
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:12,768
<font color="yellow">my blood type is O...</font>

114
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:15,428
<font color="yellow">and his blood type is A.</font>

115
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:19,228
<font color="yellow">How can my Chang Soo's blood type be B?</font>

116
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:20,228
<font color="yellow">That's nonsense.</font>

117
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:22,368
<font color="yellow">It looks like...</font>

118
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:25,098
<font color="yellow">the two kids were switched.</font>

119
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,668

121
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:36,768
<font color="yellow">but we should...</font>

122
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,328
<font color="yellow">do the DNA test for the two kids.</font>

123

00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,798
<font color="yellow">What is he saying, honey?</font>

126
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,498
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

127
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:54,798
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

128
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:57,698
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, rookie?</font>

129
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,498
<font color="yellow">- I'm coming. - Hurry up.</font>

130
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,468
<font color="yellow">I'm working so hard, too. Can you hurry up?</font>

131
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:04,228

133
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,068
<font color="yellow">Coming.</font>

00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,398
<font color="yellow">The mise-en-scene is Oscar worthy.</font>

138
00:07:26,068 --> 00:07:28,798
<font color="yellow">What do I do, then? The Marketing Team asked for assistance.</font>

139

142
00:08:02,268 --> 00:08:05,328
<font color="yellow">It's a lovely picture.</font>

143
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:07,598
<font color="yellow">Get up, you two. Are you shooting a film?</font>

144
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:12,298

149
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,868

155
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,298
<font color="yellow">The company hasn't done anything for us.</font>

156
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:51,028

00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:54,328
<font color="yellow">Yes!</font>

159
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,468
<font color="yellow">- Pork barbecue. - We'll go back to work now.</font>

160
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,128
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

161
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:01,298
<font color="yellow">We should do art again.</font>

162
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:07,868
<font color="yellow">Let's drink until tomorrow.</font>

163
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:16,728
<font color="yellow">Congratulations.</font>

164
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,198
<font color="yellow">Yes, Director Bang. Why didn't you come?</font>

165
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:31,198
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, the chairman is here.</font>

166
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:32,568
<font color="yellow">Come to the office right away.</font>

167
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,768
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm coming now.</font>

168
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,438
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, can you take this?</font>

169
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:50,938
<font color="yellow">Directer Han!</font>

170
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:53,698
<font color="yellow">Why did he leave? He said he would treat us.</font>

171
00:09:54,198 --> 00:09:56,898
<font color="yellow">Goodness, something must have gone wrong again.</font>

172
00:10:00,368 --> 00:10:03,798
<font color="yellow">Idiots. They have been doing whatever they want while I was away.</font>

173
00:10:04,068 --> 00:10:06,168
<font color="yellow">I am going to fire them all.</font>

174
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:10,028
<font color="yellow">- What now? - It's nothing.</font>

175
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,698
<font color="yellow">Did you tell Han Seong Joon to come to the office or not?</font>

176
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:13,598
<font color="yellow">He will come right away.</font>

177
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,198
<font color="yellow">Okay. Bring the documents.</font>

178
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:17,798
<font color="yellow">Here they are.</font>

179
00:10:25,568 --> 00:10:26,898
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

180
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,298
<font color="yellow">Didn't you hear me?</font>

181
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:33,398
<font color="yellow">I said I'm David Lee.</font>

182
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,198
<font color="yellow">Why are you so surprised?</font>

183
00:10:40,328 --> 00:10:43,198
<font color="yellow">You suddenly confessed it.</font>

184
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,098
<font color="yellow">And I feel a little flustered.</font>

185
00:10:45,198 --> 00:10:48,028
<font color="yellow">You left me no other option.</font>

186
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,398
<font color="yellow">Perhaps you were a Nazi councilor...</font>

187
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,598
<font color="yellow">who used to interrogate the French Resistance in your past life.</font>

188
00:10:57,328 --> 00:10:58,328
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

189
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:01,328
<font color="yellow">You were the cool French Resistance,</font>

190
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,268
<font color="yellow">and I was the shameless man who tortured people?</font>

191
00:11:10,868 --> 00:11:12,328
<font color="yellow">You are right.</font>

192
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:15,628
<font color="yellow">I completely failed.</font>

193
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,198
<font color="yellow">Completely.</font>

194
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:21,068
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

195
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,868
<font color="yellow">That's how it's like working in Wall Street.</font>

196
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:27,268
<font color="yellow">You can become rich with astronomical wealth in an instant,</font>

197
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:30,428
<font color="yellow">and you can also become a beggar in an instant, too.</font>

198
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,128
<font color="yellow">You know.</font>

199
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,198
<font color="yellow">Why did you lie, then?</font>

200
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,098
<font color="yellow">You even treated me like a lunatic. Why did you deny it all along?</font>

201
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:45,898
<font color="yellow">I was ashamed.</font>

202
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:50,128
<font color="yellow">Like you said, I was ashamed that I completely failed.</font>

203
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:53,868
<font color="yellow">I was once the best investor in Wall Street.</font>

204
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:57,198
<font color="yellow">After losing everything I had, I am sponging off my uncle.</font>

205
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:00,468
<font color="yellow">And I am working as a construction manager here.</font>

206
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:03,028
<font color="yellow">Would it be easy to admit that if you were me?</font>

207
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,168
<font color="yellow">Right. You make sense.</font>

208
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:10,928
<font color="yellow">By the way,</font>

209
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:14,568
<font color="yellow">how did you get completely bankrupted?</font>

210
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:18,328
<font color="yellow">There's a saying that wealth continues for three generations.</font>

211
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:22,568
<font color="yellow">So I expected the situation to end smoothly,</font>

212
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:26,568
<font color="yellow">and bet 10 billion euros on Greek bonds and bank notes.</font>

213
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:30,028
<font color="yellow">But it turned out to be something very reckless.</font>

214
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:32,968
<font color="yellow">Goodness. You must have...</font>

215
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:35,328
<font color="yellow">made a careful investment choice.</font>

216
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,968
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

217
00:12:38,928 --> 00:12:41,128
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I didn't know.</font>

218
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,768
<font color="yellow">I was so happy to see you.</font>

219
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:47,868
<font color="yellow">It's not easy to meet someone you meet in New York in Seoul again.</font>

220
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:49,928
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

221
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,368
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

222
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:56,568
<font color="yellow">You said you're preparing to open a cafe, right?</font>

223
00:12:58,568 --> 00:12:59,668
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

224
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:01,798
<font color="yellow">Is it going well?</font>

225
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:05,128
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

226
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,928
<font color="yellow">Even if I want to do it, I can't afford the expensive rent.</font>

227
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:14,768
<font color="yellow">I envy you. You lost everything, but you have a rich uncle.</font>

228
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:18,398
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to ask my uncle to help you?</font>

229
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:20,368
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

230
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:22,628
<font color="yellow">Ask him what?</font>

231
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:27,428
<font color="yellow">I will ask him to rent it out to you at a cheaper price.</font>

232
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:31,528
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

233
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:36,398
<font color="yellow">Like you said, we're special friends, you know?</font>

234
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:40,498
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much. Thanks a lot.</font>

235
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:43,068
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

236
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:45,628
<font color="yellow">never forget your kindness.</font>

237
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:48,568
<font color="yellow">Let's make a toast to celebrate this moment.</font>

238
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,728
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

239
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:14,898
<font color="yellow">Look who's here.</font>

240
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,328
<font color="yellow">My son-in-law is here.</font>

241
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:19,998
<font color="yellow">Hello, sir. Have you been well?</font>

242
00:14:19,998 --> 00:14:22,298
<font color="yellow">Yes, I am always well.</font>

243
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:24,568
<font color="yellow">Did you have a good time...</font>

244
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:26,928
<font color="yellow">with my Mi Joo while I was away?</font>

245
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:31,028
<font color="yellow">- Dad. - What, girl?</font>

246
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,298
<font color="yellow">There's rumor everywhere that you're so desperate for him.</font>

247
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:38,828
<font color="yellow">My pride is hurt.</font>

248
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,798
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, you should go desperate for her.</font>

249
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,898
<font color="yellow">Don't you think you're too mean?</font>

250
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:48,868
<font color="yellow">Do you want the chairman's daughter to follow you around?</font>

251
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,398
<font color="yellow">You are too stiff. That's your problem.</font>

252
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,028
<font color="yellow">Dad.</font>

253
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:54,898
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

254
00:14:56,268 --> 00:14:59,528
<font color="yellow">Watch him speak. He says he's sorry.</font>

255
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,928
<font color="yellow">Girl, what do you like about him anyway?</font>

256
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:05,398
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

257
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:09,998
<font color="yellow">Dad, what are you doing right now?</font>

258
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:13,128
<font color="yellow">Be quiet. How dare you yell at your father?</font>

259
00:15:14,398 --> 00:15:16,128
<font color="yellow">Take a seat, Seong Joon.</font>

260
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,928
<font color="yellow">Let's talk about business.</font>

261
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:20,368
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

262
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,598
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Granny?</font>

263
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,768
<font color="yellow">Just keep writing. Don't care about me.</font>

264
00:15:38,098 --> 00:15:40,028
<font color="yellow">Eat this boiled pork...</font>

265
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:41,598
<font color="yellow">for dinner.</font>

266
00:15:41,728 --> 00:15:43,428
<font color="yellow">Will you not eat with me?</font>

267
00:15:47,728 --> 00:15:50,398
<font color="yellow">What is this "No Caller ID"?</font>

268
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,068
<font color="yellow">Hello?</font>

269
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:56,198
<font color="yellow">You called me, so you should talk.</font>

270
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:59,298
<font color="yellow">Why do you always call me and not talk?</font>

271
00:15:59,568 --> 00:16:02,998
<font color="yellow">And why do you keep hiding your identity?</font>

272
00:16:03,398 --> 00:16:07,028
<font color="yellow">Why would you not reveal your caller ID?</font>

273
00:16:07,298 --> 00:16:09,798
<font color="yellow">You evil and nasty man.</font>

274
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:13,428
<font color="yellow">Reveal your identity right away.</font>

275
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:15,498
<font color="yellow">Goodness, Granny.</font>

276
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,928
<font color="yellow">She's so nasty.</font>

277
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:20,798
<font color="yellow">I love everything about her,</font>

278
00:16:20,968 --> 00:16:23,198
<font color="yellow">except for her hot temperament.</font>

279
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:28,428
<font color="yellow">How can you ignore my desperate craving for pork...</font>

280
00:16:28,428 --> 00:16:30,298
<font color="yellow">in such a rough way?</font>

281
00:16:30,468 --> 00:16:32,128
<font color="yellow">And how can she not call me?</font>

282
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,668
<font color="yellow">I can't talk to her first.</font>

283
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:40,998
<font color="yellow">I am so bored.</font>

284
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:46,728
<font color="yellow">Who is it?</font>

285
00:16:51,128 --> 00:16:52,868
<font color="yellow">- What brings you here? - Move.</font>

286
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:56,891
<font color="yellow">Did she find out that I called her?</font>

287
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,398
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

288
00:17:25,468 --> 00:17:26,798
<font color="yellow">It's so delicious.</font>

289
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,698
<font color="yellow">- Is it that delicious? - Of course it is delicious.</font>

290
00:17:31,898 --> 00:17:35,198
<font color="yellow">How do you cook boiled pork so well, Elizabeth?</font>

291
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:38,668
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Elizabeth, Grace Kelly is happy.</font>

292
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,198
<font color="yellow">I will eat one more. I could have brought it down sooner,</font>

293
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:45,328
<font color="yellow">I could have brought it down sooner, but a crazy person called me,</font>

294
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:47,398
<font color="yellow">and said nothing.</font>

295
00:17:49,298 --> 00:17:51,898
<font color="yellow">I'll teach that person a lesson if I find out who it is.</font>

296
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,298
<font color="yellow">My gosh, what a crazy man.</font>

297
00:17:55,728 --> 00:17:57,768
<font color="yellow">How do you know it's a man?</font>

298
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,028
<font color="yellow">It must be a man. I'm sure of it.</font>

299
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,898
<font color="yellow">My goodness, this is so delicious.</font>

300
00:18:08,138 --> 00:18:09,668
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth.</font>

301
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:12,668
<font color="yellow">Why don't you spend the night here?</font>

302
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:15,138
<font color="yellow">Why do you want me to spend the night here?</font>

303
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,198
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth.</font>

304
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,398
<font color="yellow">Stop nagging.</font>

305
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:29,328
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

306
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:37,928
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

307
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,568
<font color="yellow">Leave them right there.</font>

308
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:42,598
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

309
00:18:45,168 --> 00:18:46,998
<font color="yellow">Just leave it.</font>

310
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,798
<font color="yellow">It's the bill for the kimchi.</font>

311
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,298
<font color="yellow">Are you planning to make them pay for it?</font>

312
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,768
<font color="yellow">Of course, I will.</font>

313
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:56,638
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much nappa cabbages and red pepper powder cost?</font>

314
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,138
<font color="yellow">Don't forget about the salted shrimps and the seasoning.</font>

315
00:18:59,298 --> 00:19:02,028
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much it is...</font>

316
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:03,328
<font color="yellow">if you add all of them up?</font>

317
00:19:03,328 --> 00:19:06,768
<font color="yellow">How can we pay for everything? We need to split the bill.</font>

318
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:11,498
<font color="yellow">How can you do this as a mother? You're so cruel.</font>

319
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:14,868
<font color="yellow">Is this how you're going to treat them?</font>

320
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:17,828
<font color="yellow">My hands are tied. We need to live, too.</font>

321
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,798
<font color="yellow">I told them to take the kimchi.</font>

322
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:25,728
<font color="yellow">Where are they? I haven't seen them all day.</font>

323
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:30,298
<font color="yellow">Honey, what are you doing?</font>

324
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,568
<font color="yellow">Give me that.</font>

325
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,368
<font color="yellow">You know how hard it was for me to calculate all that?</font>

326
00:19:34,368 --> 00:19:36,328
<font color="yellow">Give it back. Come on.</font>

327
00:19:36,328 --> 00:19:39,638
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? My gosh. Honey?</font>

328
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,638
<font color="yellow">Spit it out. Come on.</font>

329
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:44,868
<font color="yellow">You're not going to spit it out?</font>

330
00:19:45,728 --> 00:19:46,898
<font color="yellow">You...</font>

331
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:50,138
<font color="yellow">Spit it out. Spit it out now.</font>

332
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:54,898
<font color="yellow">My goodness. I can't believe this.</font>

333
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,528
<font color="yellow">Honey, I think I'm going to die.</font>

334
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:01,368
<font color="yellow">I'm going to die.</font>

335
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,198
<font color="yellow">We're home. Hang in there.</font>

336
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:05,328
<font color="yellow">Be careful. Are you okay, honey?</font>

337
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:08,138
<font color="yellow">Should you stay in the hospital?</font>

338
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:09,468
<font color="yellow">No.</font>

339
00:20:09,768 --> 00:20:12,598
<font color="yellow">It's because I had to take...</font>

340
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:16,168
<font color="yellow">that ridiculous DNA test based on a ridiculous reason.</font>

341
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:18,528
<font color="yellow">I'm going to disown Min Seok.</font>

342
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,198
<font color="yellow">- Be careful. - Aunt.</font>

343
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:24,468
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

344
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:27,768
<font color="yellow">Why are you up here?</font>

345
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:30,068
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

346
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:33,998
<font color="yellow">I wanted to cook jjajang ramyeon with Ah In, but I didn't have a pot.</font>

347
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:38,168
<font color="yellow">My mother didn't do the dishes.</font>

348
00:20:38,168 --> 00:20:39,638
<font color="yellow">You'd better go downstairs.</font>

349
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,268
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come upstairs.</font>

350
00:20:42,268 --> 00:20:43,328
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

351
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:45,668
<font color="yellow">How dare you to yell at my son?</font>

352
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:46,968
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

353
00:20:47,298 --> 00:20:49,098
<font color="yellow">take your son...</font>

354
00:20:49,428 --> 00:20:52,768
<font color="yellow">and go downstairs immediately.</font>

00:20:56,528 --> 00:20:57,568
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

356
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,768
<font color="yellow">Let's go. Let's go with me.</font>

357
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:02,698
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

358
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:06,068
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo.</font>

359
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,928
<font color="yellow">Never...</font>

360
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:11,498
<font color="yellow">come upstairs ever again. Did you get that?</font>

361
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:13,268
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

362
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:17,428
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

363
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:22,098
<font color="yellow">Mother, what's wrong? Are you sick?</font>

364
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:24,168
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

365
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,868
<font color="yellow">She's okay. It's nothing.</font>

366
00:21:27,638 --> 00:21:29,668
<font color="yellow">Honey, why don't you lie down?</font>

367
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,668
<font color="yellow">I told you. If they never...</font>

368
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:35,898
<font color="yellow">moved in here,</font>

369
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,968
<font color="yellow">this wouldn't have happened.</font>

370
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:39,728
<font color="yellow">What did she...</font>

371
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:42,198
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

372
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,868
<font color="yellow">Do you think it happened because we moved in together?</font>

373
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:46,568
<font color="yellow">Besides,</font>

374
00:21:47,398 --> 00:21:50,128
<font color="yellow">you followed us when we moved in here.</font>

375
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:52,428
<font color="yellow">We didn't follow you.</font>

376
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,768
<font color="yellow">You tried to get here before us so you can unload your stuff.</font>

377
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,268
<font color="yellow">Stop it. The children are listening.</font>

378
00:21:58,298 --> 00:21:59,298
<font color="yellow">Move aside.</font>

379
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:00,628
<font color="yellow">And...</font>

380
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,198
<font color="yellow">Because we were getting married,</font>

381
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:06,028
<font color="yellow">you decided to get married.</font>

382
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:09,198
<font color="yellow">We got married on the same day because of you, two.</font>

383
00:22:09,698 --> 00:22:11,568
<font color="yellow">Hey, listen.</font>

384
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:14,768
<font color="yellow">We got married in a traditional Korean village of Andong.</font>

385
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:16,068
<font color="yellow">But you two...</font>

386
00:22:16,528 --> 00:22:19,728
<font color="yellow">got married in a high-class hotel.</font>

387
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,628
<font color="yellow">Because of the fuss you made,</font>

388
00:22:21,828 --> 00:22:24,028
<font color="yellow">our parents had to be split.</font>

389
00:22:24,028 --> 00:22:26,298
<font color="yellow">At the end, they got on the bus late.</font>

390
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:29,498
<font color="yellow">Because of you, my wedding started late in the evening.</font>

391
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:33,568
<font color="yellow">I saw the Moon in the sky. Did you know that?</font>

392
00:22:33,568 --> 00:22:36,898
<font color="yellow">That was the only day which was available for us.</font>

393
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,528
<font color="yellow">What was I supposed to do?</font>

394
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:40,028
<font color="yellow">That, witch.</font>

395
00:22:40,198 --> 00:22:42,198
<font color="yellow">- What? - Honey.</font>

396
00:22:42,198 --> 00:22:44,028
<font color="yellow">That's enough.</font>

397
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,428
<font color="yellow">Let me go.</font>

398
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:49,798
<font color="yellow">Stop it. Chang Soo, go upstairs and stop your Aunt.</font>

399
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:50,968
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

400
00:22:57,968 --> 00:23:00,168
<font color="yellow">Why did you come up? Go downstairs.</font>

401
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:01,368
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

402
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,098
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

403
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:06,898
<font color="yellow">Then, why would you give birth...</font>

404
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,668
<font color="yellow">at my brother's hospital?</font>

405
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,598
<font color="yellow">There are thousands of hospitals.</font>

406
00:23:10,968 --> 00:23:13,598
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to choose...</font>

407
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:15,698
<font color="yellow">my brother's hospital to give birth?</font>

408
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:16,798
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

409
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:21,298
<font color="yellow">It's not like I wanted to give birth at that hospital.</font>

410
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,598
<font color="yellow">You introduced me to that hospital.</font>

411
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:27,098
<font color="yellow">You wanted to show off that...</font>

412
00:23:27,098 --> 00:23:29,068
<font color="yellow">your brother was the director of the hospital.</font>

413
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:32,968
<font color="yellow">Hey, you told me that he gave...</font>

414
00:23:32,998 --> 00:23:35,498
<font color="yellow">a big discount for family members.</font>

415
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:39,298
<font color="yellow">Do you think I went there because I wanted to?</font>

416
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:41,068
<font color="yellow">Honey, that's enough.</font>

417
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:44,268
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, I told you to stop your Aunt. Why are you here?</font>

418
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:46,268
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

419
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,828
<font color="yellow">I told you not to come up. Go downstairs.</font>

420
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,368
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

421
00:23:58,298 --> 00:23:59,698
<font color="yellow">I'm going to lose it.</font>

422
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:02,568
<font color="yellow">Look at Hee Sook being so unreasonable.</font>

423
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:04,828
<font color="yellow">Mother, stop it.</font>

424
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:07,298
<font color="yellow">Why do you always fight with Aunt?</font>

425
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,498
<font color="yellow">If you keep arguing with Aunt,</font>

426
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:11,768
<font color="yellow">I'm going to go upstairs and live with Aunt.</font>

427
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:15,498
<font color="yellow">- Hey! - Chang Soo.</font>

428
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:17,428
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

429
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,398
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

430
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,568
<font color="yellow">I raised you for 15 years...</font>

431
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,168
<font color="yellow">the best I can.</font>

432
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,068
<font color="yellow">What? You're going to live with Aunt?</font>

433
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,068
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

434
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,098
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what he said?</font>

435
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,498
<font color="yellow">Did you hear what he said?</font>

436
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:45,268
<font color="yellow">How dare you say that to your mother?</font>

437
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:48,968
<font color="yellow">Why does she argue with pretty Aunt?</font>

438
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:50,968
<font color="yellow">Pretty? How is she pretty?</font>

439
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:54,768
<font color="yellow">Your mother is much prettier.</font>

440
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:59,168
<font color="yellow">We raised you for nothing. Han Chang Soo.</font>

441
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,268
<font color="yellow">How could you betray us?</font>

442
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:04,568
<font color="yellow">When did I betray you, Father?</font>

443
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:06,398
<font color="yellow">Come here, Chang Soo.</font>

444
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:09,628
<font color="yellow">Come here. Come to your mother.</font>

445
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:10,768
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

446
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,328
<font color="yellow">I don't think you should hug me. I'm all grown up.</font>

447
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:16,268
<font color="yellow">Please, refrain from touching me.</font>

448
00:25:19,628 --> 00:25:20,798
<font color="yellow">My son, Chang Soo.</font>

449
00:25:26,198 --> 00:25:28,068
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing?</font>

450
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:32,428
<font color="yellow">My son.</font>

451
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:35,468
<font color="yellow">Honey.</font>

452
00:25:35,468 --> 00:25:36,668
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

453
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:40,528
<font color="yellow">Honey, calm down.</font>

454
00:25:44,498 --> 00:25:47,328
<font color="yellow">Honey, I can't do this. I have to go back to the hospital.</font>

455
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:49,728
<font color="yellow">- I have to go see Ji Hoon. - Honey.</font>

456
00:25:50,268 --> 00:25:53,298
<font color="yellow">Please, calm down. Stop acting like this.</font>

457
00:25:53,528 --> 00:25:56,898
<font color="yellow">Honey, get some sleep.</font>

458
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,728
<font color="yellow">You should get some sleep.</font>

459
00:25:59,198 --> 00:26:00,628
<font color="yellow">Please, sleep.</font>

460
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,728
<font color="yellow">- Get some sleep. - Ji Hoon.</font>

461
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:19,768
<font color="yellow">What do you want, punk?</font>

462
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:21,898
<font color="yellow">Punk?</font>

463
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:23,798
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I'm not devastated?</font>

464
00:26:24,328 --> 00:26:28,568
<font color="yellow">I'm so devastated that I'm going to lose my mind or die.</font>

465
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:32,568
<font color="yellow">How can Chang Soo be my son? Does it make sense?</font>

466
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:34,498
<font color="yellow">You see it, too. Don't you?</font>

<font color="yellow">It's snowing.</font>

623
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:50,868
<font color="yellow">Good night.</font>

624
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:55,038
<font color="yellow">Good job on finishing it. I'll read them thoroughly.</font>

625
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,328
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

626
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,568
<font color="yellow">She's a handful.</font>

627
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:38,498
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

628
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,698
<font color="yellow">Hey, wake up.</font>

629
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,198
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

630
00:40:22,068 --> 00:40:23,728
<font color="yellow">Honey, don't worry too much.</font>

631
00:40:24,128 --> 00:40:25,728

633
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:29,998
<font color="yellow">Can't you see?</font>

634
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:31,798
<font color="yellow">I graduated from a law school.</font>

635
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:33,668
<font color="yellow">Our smart son, Ji Hoon takes after me.</font>

636
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:34,798
<font color="yellow">Also,</font>

637
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:38,998
<font color="yellow">he has long legs just like me.</font>

638
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:41,698
<font color="yellow">Just like me,</font>

639
00:40:41,998 --> 00:40:44,198
<font color="yellow">he has resilient buttocks.</font>

640
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:48,628
<font color="yellow">He has resilient buttocks and his buttocks are not sagging.</font>

641
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:50,728
<font color="yellow">He resembles me.</font>

642
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,068
<font color="yellow">Because he takes after you,</font>

643
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:56,268
<font color="yellow">he is so clean.</font>

644
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,698
<font color="yellow">After he takes a shower,</font>

645
00:40:57,728 --> 00:41:01,128
<font color="yellow">he cleans the whole bathroom with a towel.</font>

646
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,668
<font color="yellow">Just like you who haven't weighed more than 45kg,</font>

647

649
00:41:12,198 --> 00:41:15,328
<font color="yellow">Mom. Mom.</font>

650
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:20,328
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you?</font>

651
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,428
<font color="yellow">Stay quiet, mom.</font>

652
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:25,328
<font color="yellow">I told you to pay me for the kimchi.</font>

653

655
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:31,098
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

656
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:33,168
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

657
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,498
<font color="yellow">Mom...</font>

658
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,328
<font color="yellow">Was I fat when I was in middle school?</font>

659
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:45,828
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

660
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,968
<font color="yellow">Are you seriously asking us that?</font>

661
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,398
<font color="yellow">You always said that we favored Seong Hoon.</font>

662
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:55,538
<font color="yellow">You thought we gave good food to your brother and you got so greedy.</font>

663
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:59,368
<font color="yellow">You were as fat as Chang Soo.</font>

664
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:13,268
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you?</font>

665
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,428
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, Mom.</font>

666
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:17,628
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

667
00:42:18,298 --> 00:42:19,828
<font color="yellow">It's nothing, Dad.</font>

668
00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:41,398
<font color="yellow">What is it, Uncle?</font>

669
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:42,928
<font color="yellow">I mean...</font>

670
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,428
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

671
00:42:46,928 --> 00:42:50,328
<font color="yellow">Where did you get that bow tie?</font>

672
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:52,038
<font color="yellow">Why do you have it on?</font>

673
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:54,428
<font color="yellow">We have a musical at school before our winter break.</font>

674
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:56,968
<font color="yellow">I need to sing and dance.</font>

675
00:42:57,328 --> 00:42:59,728
<font color="yellow">I came upstairs to ask what Grandmother thinks.</font>

676
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:01,768
<font color="yellow">- Is that so? - Yes.</font>

677
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:09,928
<font color="yellow">- You... - Yes?</font>

678
00:43:12,168 --> 00:43:13,328
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

679
00:43:22,538 --> 00:43:23,698
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

680
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:25,428
<font color="yellow">Don't move.</font>

681
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:34,368
<font color="yellow">This brings me back some old memories.</font>

682
00:43:34,968 --> 00:43:36,198
<font color="yellow">Should I put it in a frame?</font>

683
00:43:38,628 --> 00:43:39,628
<font color="yellow">Hold on.</font>

684
00:43:44,768 --> 00:43:45,828
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

685
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:39,768
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, I'll get going.</font>

686
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:42,468
<font color="yellow">Please get better soon, okay?</font>

687
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:48,498
<font color="yellow">I'll visit you again. Get better.</font>

688
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:51,328
<font color="yellow">What a nice child.</font>

689
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:52,668
<font color="yellow">Come inside, Mom.</font>

690
00:44:52,828 --> 00:44:55,368
<font color="yellow">Why would you bring it? It's heavy.</font>

691
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:58,268
<font color="yellow">Because you won't come. So I brought it even though I'm old.</font>

692
00:44:58,698 --> 00:45:00,928
<font color="yellow">- So what? - Wasn't the road slippery?</font>

693
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:03,028
<font color="yellow">The snow melted.</font>

694
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:05,568
<font color="yellow">Hey,</font>

695
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:09,328
<font color="yellow">don't fight with your daughter. Invest in her.</font>

696
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:11,268
<font color="yellow">How can I invest in her more?</font>

697
00:45:11,568 --> 00:45:14,528
<font color="yellow">It's enough that I fed, clothed, and educated her.</font>

698
00:45:14,898 --> 00:45:16,868
<font color="yellow">I don't mean it financially.</font>

699
00:45:16,928 --> 00:45:20,468
<font color="yellow">Show more affections to your daughter.</font>

700
00:45:20,668 --> 00:45:24,098
<font color="yellow">Moms and daughters give and take as well.</font>

701
00:45:24,268 --> 00:45:27,368
<font color="yellow">You need to give her more love now...</font>

702
00:45:27,368 --> 00:45:30,198
<font color="yellow">so that you won't be lonely later.</font>

703
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:32,468
<font color="yellow">I won't be lonely.</font>

704
00:45:32,468 --> 00:45:35,468
<font color="yellow">I'm certain you will be.</font>

705
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:38,198
<font color="yellow">There's something you don't know.</font>

706
00:45:38,328 --> 00:45:41,598
<font color="yellow">A pigeon and a crow come to my balcony...</font>

707
00:45:41,668 --> 00:45:42,868
<font color="yellow">in the morning.</font>

708
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:44,798
<font color="yellow">So do you talk to them?</font>

709
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:47,328
<font color="yellow">They're better than my daughter sometimes.</font>

710
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,068
<font color="yellow">What's going to happen when you are sick and old?</font>

711
00:45:50,128 --> 00:45:51,968
<font color="yellow">I won't be sick.</font>

712
00:45:51,968 --> 00:45:53,498
<font color="yellow">No, you will be.</font>

713
00:45:53,828 --> 00:45:55,128
<font color="yellow">Don't be so sure.</font>

714
00:45:55,328 --> 00:45:58,728
<font color="yellow">My insurance covers caregivers, too.</font>

715
00:45:58,898 --> 00:46:01,628
<font color="yellow">What if you pass away...</font>

716
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:04,268
<font color="yellow">when the caregiver is gone?</font>

717
00:46:04,268 --> 00:46:06,198
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about that, too.</font>

718
00:46:06,398 --> 00:46:08,828
<font color="yellow">When I turn 77 years old,</font>

719
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:10,698
<font color="yellow">I'll head to Switzerland.</font>

720
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,998
<font color="yellow">I'm going to apply for euthanasia.</font>

721
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:15,868

00:46:15,868 --> 00:46:16,998
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

723
00:46:17,128 --> 00:46:20,898
<font color="yellow">How dare you say those words to your mother?</font>

724
00:46:20,898 --> 00:46:24,828
<font color="yellow">Why would you go all the way to Switzerland wasting all that money?</font>

725
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:27,068
<font color="yellow">Why don't you die here? What a horrible daughter.</font>

726
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:29,198
<font color="yellow">You're hurting me, Mom.</font>

727
00:46:29,198 --> 00:46:31,698
<font color="yellow">I'm hitting you to hurt you. I'm not trying to tickle you.</font>

729
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:35,598
<font color="yellow">- Goodness. - Come out, Jeong Eun.</font>

730
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:38,598
<font color="yellow">Listen to what your mother's saying.</font>

731
00:46:38,598 --> 00:46:42,598
<font color="yellow">Learn from her and act just like her in front of her.</font>

732
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:44,498
<font color="yellow">That's how she will know how I feel.</font>

733

740
00:47:30,168 --> 00:47:32,098
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me this one time.</font>

741
00:47:32,098 --> 00:47:34,798

742
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:38,628

744
00:47:42,098 --> 00:47:44,368
<font color="yellow">- We should teach him a lesson! - Yes!</font>

745

<font color="yellow">Shame on you.</font>

746

<font color="yellow">- Shame on you! - What a jerk.</font>

750

776
00:50:26,698 --> 00:50:29,368
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang. Please tell us again.</font>

777
00:50:29,868 --> 00:50:31,368
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

778
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,098
<font color="yellow">According to the DNA test,</font>

779
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:37,198
<font color="yellow">it's confirmed that Han Chang Soo isn't...</font>

780
00:50:40,068 --> 00:50:42,098
<font color="yellow">the biological son of Seo Hye Joo and Han Seong Hoon.</font>

781
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:44,328
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me? - And...</font>

782
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,928
<font color="yellow">it's also confirmed that Han Ji Hoon isn't...</font>

783
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:54,168
<font color="yellow">the biological son of Kang Hee Sook and Han Seong Sik, either.</font>

784
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,668
<font color="yellow">That's... I can't believe this is happening.</font>

785
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:04,698
<font color="yellow">What... What are you saying?</font>

786
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:07,868
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

787
00:51:07,928 --> 00:51:09,598
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

788
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:13,368
<font color="yellow">I should have delivered the right baby.</font>

789
00:51:13,398 --> 00:51:15,968
<font color="yellow">- What? - I delivered two babies at once.</font>

790
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,028
<font color="yellow">Please forgive me.</font>

791
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:19,098
<font color="yellow">So?</font>

792
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:21,868
<font color="yellow">What are you trying to say?</font>

793
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:27,798
<font color="yellow">- Dr. Kang! - I sincerely apologize.</font>

794
00:51:28,868 --> 00:51:30,268
<font color="yellow">According to the DNA test,</font>

795
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:32,928
<font color="yellow">it shows that...</font>

796
00:51:33,828 --> 00:51:35,998
<font color="yellow">your sons have been switched.</font>

797
00:51:37,468 --> 00:51:40,598
<font color="yellow">The possibility of Ji Hoon being your son...</font>

798
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:42,998
<font color="yellow">is 99 percent.</font>

799
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:47,068
<font color="yellow">Also, Seong Hoon...</font>

800
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:49,068
<font color="yellow">and Hee Sook.</font>

801
00:51:50,198 --> 00:51:52,098
<font color="yellow">The possibility of Chang Soo being your son...</font>

802
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:54,298
<font color="yellow">is 99 percent.</font>

803
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:56,828
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

804
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:06,728
<font color="yellow">What kind of nonsense is this?</font>

805
00:52:07,098 --> 00:52:09,368
<font color="yellow">How can... This is absurd!</font>

806
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:11,428
<font color="yellow">It's total nonsense!</font>

807
00:52:11,598 --> 00:52:14,198
<font color="yellow">Are you sure that the DNA test is accurate?</font>

808
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,998
<font color="yellow">Unfortunately, yes.</font>

809
00:52:16,868 --> 00:52:18,368
<font color="yellow">I'm truly sorry.</font>

810
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,368
<font color="yellow">Goodness... Min Seok!</font>

811
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:34,028
<font color="yellow">Please forgive us.</font>

812
00:52:35,568 --> 00:52:36,568
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

813
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:38,868
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

814
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:43,868
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

815
00:52:44,428 --> 00:52:47,498
<font color="yellow">What are they saying?</font>

816
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:49,428
<font color="yellow">What are they...</font>

817
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:53,198
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

818
00:52:56,568 --> 00:52:58,028
<font color="yellow">Don't be ridiculous.</font>

819
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:02,298
<font color="yellow">Do you think I will believe you?</font>

820
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:11,298
<font color="yellow">Do you think I will believe this?</font>

821
00:53:12,428 --> 00:53:14,828
<font color="yellow">Not a chance. I will...</font>

822
00:53:16,268 --> 00:53:18,098
<font color="yellow">run the DNA test again.</font>

823
00:53:19,568 --> 00:53:21,968
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook... Hee Sook!</font>

824
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:24,728
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook!</font>

825
00:53:25,498 --> 00:53:28,068
<font color="yellow">Honey. Wake up.</font>

826
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:29,598
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo!</font>

827
00:53:30,368 --> 00:53:31,998
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

828
00:53:32,268 --> 00:53:33,728
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

829
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,128
<font color="yellow">Where is he?</font>

830
00:53:35,828 --> 00:53:38,468
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook. Hee Sook!</font>

831
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:39,898
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook!</font>

832
00:53:42,698 --> 00:53:46,198
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook. Hee Sook!</font>

833
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:49,168
<font color="yellow">- Aunt. - You...</font>

834
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:52,968
<font color="yellow">- You... You brat. - Wait.</font>

835
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:55,668
<font color="yellow">Why aren't they taking it when we told them to?</font>

836
00:53:55,668 --> 00:53:58,068
<font color="yellow">Are they trying to get out of paying me for the kimchi?</font>

837
00:53:58,628 --> 00:54:00,668
<font color="yellow">Gosh. How can you think that?</font>

838
00:54:00,668 --> 00:54:03,368
<font color="yellow">Are the kids home? The light is on.</font>

839
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:06,198
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this to me, Aunt?</font>

840
00:54:07,268 --> 00:54:09,028
<font color="yellow">Why are you doing this?</font>

841
00:54:09,168 --> 00:54:11,098
<font color="yellow">It sounds like Chang Soo is crying.</font>

842
00:54:11,628 --> 00:54:13,368
<font color="yellow">- Hee Sook. - I said come here.</font>

843
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:15,128
<font color="yellow">- Aunt... - Run, Chang Soo.</font>

844
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:17,898
<font color="yellow">- Come here. - Hee Sook.</font>

845
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:19,198
<font color="yellow">Wait, Hee Sook.</font>

846
00:54:20,168 --> 00:54:22,928
<font color="yellow">Aunt. Why are you doing this to me?</font>

847
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,728
<font color="yellow">- You're scaring me. - Hee Sook.</font>

848
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,168
<font color="yellow">Stop it already.</font>

849
00:54:27,168 --> 00:54:28,898
<font color="yellow">- Stay out of the way. - Why are you... Gosh.</font>

850
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:31,168
<font color="yellow">I said come here. Why won't you listen to me?</font>

851
00:54:31,198 --> 00:54:34,598
<font color="yellow">- Why won't you? Give me your hair. - Hee Sook. Wait.</font>

852
00:54:34,598 --> 00:54:36,768
<font color="yellow">Give me your hair. Get off of me.</font>

853
00:54:36,828 --> 00:54:39,198
<font color="yellow">Give me your hair. Give it to me!</font>

854
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,828
<font color="yellow">- Get off of me! - Hee Sook!</font>

855
00:54:43,968 --> 00:54:45,168
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

856
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:54,168
<font color="yellow">What? What did you just say?</font>

857
00:54:55,468 --> 00:54:56,968
<font color="yellow">Your sons have been switched?</font>

858
00:54:59,398 --> 00:55:00,398
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

859
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:02,568
<font color="yellow">Oh, dear.</font>

860
00:55:10,368 --> 00:55:11,568
<font color="yellow">- Mother. - Hee Sook.</font>

861
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:14,198
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. It's not true.</font>

862
00:55:15,198 --> 00:55:16,728
<font color="yellow">It's not true.</font>

863
00:55:22,298 --> 00:55:23,528
<font color="yellow">She is...</font>

864
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:27,728
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with her? Oh, my. Hyung Seop.</font>

865
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:36,768
<font color="yellow">I know I'm right.</font>

866
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:39,368
<font color="yellow">- I'm sure it's true. - It's only a rumor.</font>

867
00:55:40,198 --> 00:55:42,028
<font color="yellow">Anyway, they don't seem happy.</font>

868
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:45,798
<font color="yellow">- I told you I'm sure of it. - Do you know anything?</font>

869
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,098
<font color="yellow">It does look strange.</font>

870
00:55:57,868 --> 00:55:59,998
<font color="yellow">We have to hire a star writer,</font>

871
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:02,198
<font color="yellow">and air the show no matter what.</font>

872
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:05,868
<font color="yellow">And we must make a hit. That's the only option we have.</font>

873
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:07,328
<font color="yellow">I guess so.</font>

874
00:56:08,128 --> 00:56:09,768
<font color="yellow">That's the only way to protect those people.</font>

875
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:12,128
<font color="yellow">Wait around for a while. I have a meeting with the directors.</font>

876
00:56:12,398 --> 00:56:14,328
<font color="yellow">Let's have a glass of wine afterwards.</font>

877
00:56:14,598 --> 00:56:15,928
<font color="yellow">I'm having dinner with our team.</font>

878
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:18,968
<font color="yellow">- Go, Marketing Team! - Go, Contents Team!</font>

879
00:56:18,998 --> 00:56:21,968
<font color="yellow">- Cheers! - Cheers! It's good to be here.</font>

880
00:56:27,198 --> 00:56:29,628
<font color="yellow">Director Han. Let me pour you a drink.</font>

881
00:56:29,868 --> 00:56:30,898
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

882
00:56:39,168 --> 00:56:42,168
<font color="yellow">You're so wild, Director Han.</font>

883
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:45,398
<font color="yellow">My dear Director Han,</font>

884
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,098
<font color="yellow">let me pour you a drink this time.</font>

885
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:51,498
<font color="yellow">You're going to knock it back again, right?</font>

886
00:56:51,728 --> 00:56:54,568
<font color="yellow">- Slam it! Bottoms up! - Bottoms up!</font>

887
00:56:58,198 --> 00:57:00,268
<font color="yellow">He drinks a lot because he's still young.</font>

888
00:57:00,598 --> 00:57:02,198
<font color="yellow">Are you going to pour me a glass?</font>

889
00:57:02,268 --> 00:57:05,398
<font color="yellow">Gosh, thank you.</font>

890
00:57:05,628 --> 00:57:08,268
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, rookie? Drink that, and let me pour you another.</font>

891
00:57:08,768 --> 00:57:09,768
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

892
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:18,498
<font color="yellow">Don't try to get out of drinking. You should knock it back,</font>

893
00:57:18,528 --> 00:57:20,068
<font color="yellow">and flip the glass above your head.</font>

894
00:57:20,428 --> 00:57:21,428
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

895
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:27,468
<font color="yellow">Good.</font>

896
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:32,268
<font color="yellow">Anyway, hang in there, everyone. We can do it!</font>

897
00:57:32,298 --> 00:57:34,828
<font color="yellow">Let's all say, "We can do it."</font>

898
00:57:34,928 --> 00:57:38,128
<font color="yellow">- We can do it! - We can do it!</font>

899
00:57:38,128 --> 00:57:39,628
<font color="yellow">- Drink up! - Yes!</font>

900
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:51,798
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this is driving me crazy.</font>

901
00:57:52,128 --> 00:57:55,268
<font color="yellow">Why did I ask her to sleep here? I can't believe this.</font>

902
00:58:01,098 --> 00:58:03,028
<font color="yellow">I guess I won't be able to sleep anymore.</font>

903
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:07,328
<font color="yellow">It looks like loneliness and snoring are big problems for old people.</font>

904
00:58:14,468 --> 00:58:17,668
<font color="yellow">We'll get going now, Sir.</font>

905
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,268
<font color="yellow">Ms. Hong and Ms. Na, you can go home yourselves, right?</font>

906
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:23,928
<font color="yellow">Don't mind us and take care of Mr. Park.</font>

907
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:25,798
<font color="yellow">He's totally drunk.</font>

908
00:58:25,898 --> 00:58:27,428
<font color="yellow">I love you, everyone.</font>

909
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:29,368
<font color="yellow">You should love your wife instead.</font>

910
00:58:29,498 --> 00:58:30,498
<font color="yellow">Go on.</font>

911
00:58:30,498 --> 00:58:34,698
<font color="yellow">Our handsome Director Han, we'll go and have a couple of more drinks.</font>

912
00:58:34,698 --> 00:58:37,128
<font color="yellow">I'll see you. Please don't drink too much</font>

913
00:58:37,668 --> 00:58:38,798
<font color="yellow">We always drink too much.</font>

914
00:58:46,368 --> 00:58:48,998
<font color="yellow">Are you okay? You drank quite a lot.</font>

915
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:50,798
<font color="yellow">I'm okay.</font>

916
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:54,598
<font color="yellow">We should go, too.</font>

917
00:59:02,468 --> 00:59:03,498
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

918
00:59:22,298 --> 00:59:24,268
<font color="yellow">Where did you say you live, Dong Hui?</font>

919
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:26,428
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

920
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,398
<font color="yellow">I live in Cheonho-dong.</font>

921
00:59:33,168 --> 00:59:35,598
<font color="yellow">Where in Cheonho-dong? I'll drop you off.</font>

922
00:59:35,898 --> 00:59:37,168
<font color="yellow">No, I'm fine.</font>

923
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,968
<font color="yellow">Let me get off here. I can go home by myself.</font>

924
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:41,428
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

925
00:59:41,598 --> 00:59:44,628
<font color="yellow">We're going to a hotel near there to drink wine.</font>

926
00:59:44,898 --> 00:59:46,568
<font color="yellow">I can drop you off on the way.</font>

927
01:00:01,068 --> 01:00:03,368
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon. It seems like you drank a lot.</font>

928
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:05,068
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling okay?</font>

929
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,528
<font color="yellow">After dropping off Dong Hui, let's just have some...</font>

930
01:00:08,168 --> 01:00:09,728
<font color="yellow">hangover food instead of wine.</font>

931
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:13,628
<font color="yellow">I'm fine. Focus on your driving.</font>

932
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:15,868
<font color="yellow">I should have called chauffeur service.</font>

933
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:19,698
<font color="yellow">No. I don't like to be disturbed by others when I'm with you.</font>

934
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:30,698
<font color="yellow">You're still wearing that watch.</font>

935
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:33,198
<font color="yellow">We bought one for each when we were on...</font>

936
01:00:33,198 --> 01:00:35,098
<font color="yellow">a business trip to Switzerland together.</font>

937
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,268
<font color="yellow">You still wear that.</font>

938
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:41,328
<font color="yellow">I hope you're not offended by what my dad said.</font>

939
01:00:41,698 --> 01:00:45,468
<font color="yellow">He's being hard on you because he thinks you'll be...</font>

940
01:00:45,568 --> 01:00:47,028
<font color="yellow">his successor.</font>

941
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:48,498
<font color="yellow">We shouldn't talk about that now.</font>

942
01:00:50,098 --> 01:00:52,968
<font color="yellow">Oh, my. Can you pretend you didn't hear that, Dong Hui?</font>

943
01:00:53,268 --> 01:00:56,028
<font color="yellow">We haven't made it official at the company.</font>

944
01:01:00,468 --> 01:01:01,928
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

945
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:09,098
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon, I spilled coffee. There should be some tissues there.</font>

946
01:01:17,828 --> 01:01:19,298
<font color="yellow">I'm so clumsy.</font>

947
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:22,298
<font color="yellow">I should be more composed when I get married.</font>

948
01:01:22,768 --> 01:01:23,928
<font color="yellow">Don't you think?</font>

949
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:41,198
<font color="yellow">Is this your house, Dong Hui?</font>

950
01:01:42,128 --> 01:01:43,128
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

951
01:01:43,898 --> 01:01:46,198
<font color="yellow">I didn't know there were still houses like this in Seoul.</font>

952
01:01:48,398 --> 01:01:51,598
<font color="yellow">Well... I'll get going, then.</font>

953
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:02,698
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

954
01:02:05,398 --> 01:02:06,928
<font color="yellow">Goodbye, Dong Hui.</font>

955
01:03:06,728 --> 01:03:08,568
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

956
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:09,698
<font color="yellow">Stop it already!</font>

957
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:11,528
<font color="yellow">Many people still live in places like that.</font>

958
01:03:11,528 --> 01:03:13,598
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui. Why aren't you answering my calls?</font>

959
01:03:13,598 --> 01:03:16,068
<font color="yellow">I worked so hard to raise my son.</font>

960
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:18,398
<font color="yellow">I worked hard to raise my son, too.</font>

961
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:20,898
<font color="yellow">I'm not your boyfriend or husband.</font>

962
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:24,798
<font color="yellow">My mom and my family don't like me very much.</font>

963
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:25,828
<font color="yellow">Am I really...</font>

964
01:03:26,528 --> 01:03:28,398
<font color="yellow">Aunt's son?</font>

965
01:03:28,398 --> 01:03:29,868
<font color="yellow">Thank you for everything.</font>

966
01:03:30,468 --> 01:03:32,998
<font color="yellow">Why do you worry about me?</font>

967
01:03:33,028 --> 01:03:35,898
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry about that, but I meant it.</font>
