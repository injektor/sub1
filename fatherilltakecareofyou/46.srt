1
00:00:08,038 --> 00:00:10,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Seong Hoon was conned?</font>

2
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:13,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Again?</font>

4
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

5
00:00:16,368 --> 00:00:17,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe it.</font>

6
00:00:18,338 --> 00:00:20,398
<font color=#FFFF00>This can't be happening.</font>

7
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:23,168
<font color=#FFFF00>This is old news in my family.</font>

8
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,228
<font color=#FFFF00>How can this happen?</font>

9
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:27,998
<font color=#FFFF00>The truth is...</font>

10
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:34,438
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a long story.</font>

11
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,438
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

12
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:38,598
<font color=#FFFF00>we moved into a house on the next street.</font>

13
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a three bedroom house on a deposit basis.</font>

14
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,398
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why the whole house was empty.</font>

15
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:48,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have had a lot on your plate with your family problem.</font>

16
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:50,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry that have I put you...</font>

17
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,128
<font color=#FFFF00>through my problem too.</font>

18
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:55,028
<font color=#FFFF00>What? You were locked up.</font>

19
00:00:55,228 --> 00:00:56,328
<font color=#FFFF00>How could I have lived?</font>

20
00:00:57,428 --> 00:00:58,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Director.</font>

21
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:01,728
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

22
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:04,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make sure to return your favor.</font>

23
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:06,928
<font color=#FFFF00>How will you return the favor?</font>

24
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you...</font>

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,328
<font color=#FFFF00>going to marry me or something?</font>

26
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:13,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop joking.</font>

27
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:19,328
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

28
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:22,128
<font color=#FFFF00>did you figure it out?</font>

29
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:23,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Figure what out?</font>

30
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:27,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Figure out that you were to inherit the company?</font>

31
00:01:29,968 --> 00:01:31,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't that a bit funny?</font>

32
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,498
<font color=#FFFF00>A bit funny?</font>

33
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:35,898
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is this?</font>

34
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:39,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You're like the main character in your drama.</font>

35
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:41,068
<font color=#FFFF00>That's exactly my point.</font>

36
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't have any memories about my childhood.</font>

37
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:45,928
<font color=#FFFF00>They told me that I was an heiress.</font>

38
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:48,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Imagine my surprise.</font>

39
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:52,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It could have been nicer if I could have helped you out.</font>

40
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:55,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry that I am a poor heiress.</font>

41
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,728
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need money.</font>

42
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:02,398
<font color=#FFFF00>We are a big family.</font>

43
00:02:02,398 --> 00:02:05,568
<font color=#FFFF00>If everyone works hard together, things will get better soon.</font>

44
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:11,538
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, you must be disappointed though.</font>

45
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Exactly.</font>

46
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:15,538
<font color=#FFFF00>I should have been arrogant...</font>

47
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:17,898
<font color=#FFFF00>and yelled at Director Bang.</font>

48
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:19,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I lost my chance.</font>

49
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

50
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:32,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Hang in there a bit longer.</font>

51
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

52
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I might be able to help you get back what was yours.</font>

53
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:40,728
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

54
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't.</font>

55
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:43,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't need...</font>

56
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:46,398
<font color=#FFFF00>what was mine before.</font>

57
00:02:46,928 --> 00:02:48,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Have you forgotten when you first came to the company?</font>

58
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You had to sign that terrible contract because of your cousin.</font>

59
00:02:52,498 --> 00:02:53,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't care.</font>

60
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to that, I became a scriptwriter...</font>

61
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,098
<font color=#FFFF00>and met you, Director.</font>

62
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:05,128
<font color=#FFFF00>So I don't want to be greedy.</font>

63
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:07,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out who I am...</font>

64
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,928
<font color=#FFFF00>and where I came from.</font>

65
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:13,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay with that.</font>

66
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:18,528
<font color=#FFFF00>But I just don't know how I can help...</font>

67
00:03:18,528 --> 00:03:21,128
<font color=#FFFF00>my grandmother escape from the sanatorium.</font>

68
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:24,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I got out because of her will, but my grandmother...</font>

69
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:28,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know if Bang Gwang Jin will keep his promise.</font>

70
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about that.</font>

71
00:03:30,898 --> 00:03:32,168
<font color=#FFFF00>By all means,</font>

72
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:34,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I am going to get her out.</font>

73
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:38,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm scared that might put you in danger.</font>

74
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:40,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I am...</font>

75
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:42,898
<font color=#FFFF00>not scared at all.</font>

76
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,668
<font color=#FFFF00>A scarier thing...</font>

77
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:47,168
<font color=#FFFF00>than that happened to me.</font>

78
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

79
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I found out that you were an heiress...</font>

80
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,468
<font color=#FFFF00>and I thought I might lose you.</font>

81
00:03:58,168 --> 00:03:59,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I was afraid.</font>

82
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:01,368
<font color=#FFFF00>No way.</font>

83
00:04:01,928 --> 00:04:04,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you be? Why would you lose me?</font>

84
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I came back here for you.</font>

85
00:04:17,268 --> 00:04:18,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry.</font>

86
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Everything will be okay.</font>

87
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It will be.</font>

88
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:40,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. She's on the eighth floor.</font>

89
00:04:42,528 --> 00:04:43,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh, no.</font>

90
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:46,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

91
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo, calm down. She's sleeping.</font>

92
00:04:57,368 --> 00:04:58,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Please?</font>

93
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,298
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth happened?</font>

94
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What is wrong with her?</font>

95
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:08,698
<font color=#FFFF00>It hasn't been long since she moved out.</font>

96
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:10,798
<font color=#FFFF00>First of all, we should meet the doctor.</font>

97
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

98
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:16,168
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that I was here?</font>

99
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandma. Are you all right?</font>

100
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:21,868
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no reason why I shouldn't be all right.</font>

101
00:05:23,028 --> 00:05:25,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Move aside. Hey, move aside.</font>

102
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:27,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

103
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

104
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:33,928
<font color=#FFFF00>How...</font>

105
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,998
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get here?</font>

106
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:39,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- Well... - Grandmother.</font>

107
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You are too mean.</font>

108
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:44,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You should have given me a call if you were sick.</font>

109
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:48,398
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you find out?</font>

110
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon gave us a call.</font>

111
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:51,198
<font color=#FFFF00>He said he was with Dong Hui.</font>

112
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,228
<font color=#FFFF00>He said that you were in the hospital and to visit you.</font>

113
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What is wrong with your health?</font>

114
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:59,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing is wrong.</font>

115
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:02,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just stressed out.</font>

116
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:04,298
<font color=#FFFF00>I must have been exhausted.</font>

117
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,628
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nothing to worry about.</font>

118
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother. You are too cruel.</font>

119
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:12,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You made us worried sick about you.</font>

120
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:15,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You are horrible, Grandmother.</font>

121
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:21,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What has gotten into you?</font>

122
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'm sorry.</font>

123
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:27,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

124
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:30,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dong Hui. - Seong Joon.</font>

125
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Ms. Oh. It was quite an ordeal you went through.</font>

126
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Thank you so much.</font>

127
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:38,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I won't ever...</font>

128
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:40,498
<font color=#FFFF00>forget your kindness for us.</font>

129
00:06:42,398 --> 00:06:43,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What is going on?</font>

130
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:46,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are Grandmother and Seong Joon getting along...</font>

131
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,128
<font color=#FFFF00>so well so suddenly?</font>

132
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Kindness? What kindness?</font>

133
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Well, Hye Joo.</font>

134
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:53,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seriously. - Ouch.</font>

135
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,428
<font color=#FFFF00>- You are the problem. It's you! - Hye Joo.</font>

136
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:59,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all because you started to date Seong Joon.</font>

137
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Because you started to date Seong Joon,</font>

138
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:03,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother got sick because she had to move out.</font>

139
00:07:03,528 --> 00:07:05,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- You are the problem. - Hye Joo.</font>

140
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:08,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Hye Joo. Don't hit Dong Hui.</font>

141
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you.</font>

142
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you're moving to another company.</font>

143
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,228
<font color=#FFFF00>UN Production? Is that right?</font>

144
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,428
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you know that?</font>

145
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,368
<font color=#FFFF00>That's not the problem.</font>

146
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Go terminate the contract now.</font>

147
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:32,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Seong Hoon. - I heard they are nasty.</font>

148
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you go there?</font>

149
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't do that just for money.</font>

150
00:07:38,068 --> 00:07:40,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon. It's not like that.</font>

151
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:42,498
<font color=#FFFF00>That's it. I heard everything from Jeong Eun.</font>

152
00:07:43,328 --> 00:07:44,968
<font color=#FFFF00>If anything goes wrong with you,</font>

153
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:47,468
<font color=#FFFF00>our family won't be able to face you.</font>

154
00:07:53,698 --> 00:07:55,598
<font color=#FFFF00>You must have gone through a lot.</font>

155
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't help you even after knowing all that.</font>

156
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry I couldn't comfort you.</font>

157
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:06,468
<font color=#FFFF00>But we can't just receive help from you again.</font>

158
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:08,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I know we are family,</font>

159
00:08:09,368 --> 00:08:11,468
<font color=#FFFF00>but we will be deeply ashamed.</font>

160
00:08:11,828 --> 00:08:12,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so?</font>

161
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:14,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm okay with it.</font>

162
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,328
<font color=#FFFF00>We are not okay with it.</font>

163
00:08:17,668 --> 00:08:18,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Go terminate the contract anyway.</font>

164
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:22,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Would there be a cancellation charge or something?</font>

165
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:27,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay. I'll look for the money.</font>

166
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:29,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

167
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:31,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom and Dad know the whole thing.</font>

168
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,168
<font color=#FFFF00>They are devastated too.</font>

169
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Why won't they be?</font>

170
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,268
<font color=#FFFF00>We are leaving all the burdens on their youngest son.</font>

171
00:08:38,468 --> 00:08:40,938
<font color=#FFFF00>So make sure to terminate the contract tomorrow.</font>

172
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:42,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay?</font>

173
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What does that mean?</font>

174
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What's all that? Revenge? Mr. Lee?</font>

175
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Is President Lee Seong Joon's biological brother?</font>

176
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't know that?</font>

177
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't Seong Joon tell you that?</font>

178
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,938
<font color=#FFFF00>No. He just said he met his brother.</font>

179
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:08,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon...</font>

180
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:10,698
<font color=#FFFF00>has been through a lot of heartaches lately.</font>

181
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean...</font>

182
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:14,998
<font color=#FFFF00>things are still hard for him.</font>

183
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,868
<font color=#FFFF00>So are you saying they are not talking...</font>

184
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>to each other at all now?</font>

185
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is very upset.</font>

186
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,698
<font color=#FFFF00>President Lee made our family miserable after all.</font>

187
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,368
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen?</font>

188
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:33,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

189
00:09:35,898 --> 00:09:37,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to say the same thing to you.</font>

190
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:41,168
<font color=#FFFF00>How could this happen to you?</font>

191
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What will you do with Seong Joon?</font>

192
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you still with him?</font>

193
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:51,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you going to marry him or what?</font>

194
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,438
<font color=#FFFF00>- You still don't get it, do you? - Hye Joo, please.</font>

195
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:56,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

196
00:09:57,468 --> 00:09:58,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother is watching.</font>

197
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,528
<font color=#FFFF00>- So what? - That hurt.</font>

198
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:08,328
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Han Seong Joon did that?</font>

199
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:09,628
<font color=#FFFF00>That's ridiculous.</font>

200
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:12,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It can't be true. There must have been a misunderstanding.</font>

201
00:10:12,298 --> 00:10:13,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of it.</font>

202
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:18,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What did Seong Joon that jerk do?</font>

203
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:20,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't you know?</font>

204
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:22,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is helping...</font>

205
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park Chang Wook prepare for her return.</font>

206
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:27,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

207
00:10:27,398 --> 00:10:30,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You didn't even know what your future son-in-law is doing.</font>

208
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang, are you sure you are marrying Director Han?</font>

209
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you just say?</font>

210
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:39,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What a jerk.</font>

211
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>How did he find out about Chairwoman Park?</font>

212
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:44,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

213
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:46,568
<font color=#FFFF00>It's Gui Boon.</font>

214
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Gui Boon...</font>

215
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:52,868
<font color=#FFFF00>and Seong Joon are in-laws.</font>

216
00:10:55,128 --> 00:10:56,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Darn it!</font>

217
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You darn old lady.</font>

218
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I...</font>

219
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,928
<font color=#FFFF00>will make him regret it.</font>

220
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,328
<font color=#FFFF00>At the last moment,</font>

221
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:09,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I gave you the most important information.</font>

222
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,598
<font color=#FFFF00>On the day you officially take over as the chairman,</font>

223
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:13,568
<font color=#FFFF00>make sure to hand over...</font>

224
00:11:13,598 --> 00:11:16,398
<font color=#FFFF00>the shares of the contents team to me according to the note.</font>

225
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:18,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I should get going.</font>

226
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You ungrateful jerk!</font>

227
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:53,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you crying?</font>

228
00:11:54,368 --> 00:11:55,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you so sad about?</font>

229
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:58,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Please get out of my room.</font>

230
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Shame on you.</font>

231
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:02,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you.</font>

232
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>That jerk doesn't love you.</font>

233
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:07,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It just serves you right.</font>

234
00:12:08,868 --> 00:12:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought he was a pushover.</font>

235
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:12,328
<font color=#FFFF00>How could he hatch a plot like that?</font>

236
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:16,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only person who didn't see through him.</font>

237
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

238
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:22,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to do now.</font>

239
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:25,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I should've fired him well before.</font>

240
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I couldn't do that because of you. Look at us.</font>

241
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:32,898
<font color=#FFFF00>It's like my own pit bull has turned on me.</font>

242
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, Dad.</font>

243
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:39,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You can do whatever you want now.</font>

244
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:43,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what to do anymore.</font>

245
00:12:46,498 --> 00:12:48,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Now you have it all together.</font>

246
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:54,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I will never forgive that scumbag.</font>

247
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:56,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You should just stay out of this.</font>

248
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:19,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

249
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning, Director Bang.</font>

250
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What...</font>

251
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:28,898
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you doing here?</font>

252
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- How dare you show up here? - Why?</font>

253
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Why shouldn't I be here?</font>

254
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:41,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You took all my money and position.</font>

255
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:43,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even want to stop me make a living?</font>

256
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't kid yourself.</font>

257
00:13:45,798 --> 00:13:47,568
<font color=#FFFF00>It wasn't yours to begin with.</font>

258
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:52,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

259
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:54,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it was.</font>

260
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,268
<font color=#FFFF00>You and your father caused matters to come to this...</font>

261
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,068
<font color=#FFFF00>trying to take everything from me.</font>

262
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,968
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - Even though...</font>

263
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:06,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I threw up everything and left,
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13</font>

264
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,198
<font color=#FFFF00>but it doesn't change the fact that the Bang's blood...</font>

265
00:14:10,828 --> 00:14:12,028
<font color=#FFFF00>flows in my veins.</font>

266
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,528
<font color=#FFFF00>And the fact remains that I'm your cousin.</font>

267
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:19,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that we are in the company,</font>

268
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:21,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll be polite to you.</font>

269
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,698
<font color=#FFFF00>So you'd better behave...</font>

270
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:26,698
<font color=#FFFF00>with the minimum amount of courtesy.</font>

271
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:34,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that...</font>

272
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Writer Choi quit.</font>

273
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:40,028
<font color=#FFFF00>And you even handed my script...</font>

274
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,028
<font color=#FFFF00>saying it was Writer Choi's.</font>

275
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm the only one left now.</font>

276
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:48,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You can't complete the drama without me.</font>

277
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:50,828
<font color=#FFFF00>So I'll work hard.</font>

278
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, are you out of your mind?</font>

279
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:55,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Bang.</font>

280
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:58,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Be careful about what you say.</font>

281
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:01,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Even though I'm a person without a penny,</font>

282
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:02,628
<font color=#FFFF00>it won't do you any good...</font>

283
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:04,998
<font color=#FFFF00>if people in the company find out...</font>

284
00:15:05,428 --> 00:15:07,568
<font color=#FFFF00>the relationship between you and me.</font>

285
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

286
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:17,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you can protect...</font>

287
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon, who you love so much?</font>

288
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What can you do for Seong Joon?</font>

289
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:28,468
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not that you can only protect someone with wealth and fame.</font>

290
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you threw away Grandmother's will?</font>

291
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:34,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that why you let her rewrite it?</font>

292
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:37,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know...</font>

293
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,628
<font color=#FFFF00>you wouldn't like it.</font>

294
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me.</font>

295
00:15:42,098 --> 00:15:44,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You won't be able to protect Seong Joon anymore.</font>

296
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:01,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Really? - You can't do this now.</font>

297
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,228
<font color=#FFFF00>We have a problem with the drama.</font>

298
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,398
<font color=#FFFF00>- It looks good, right? - I don't know.</font>

299
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

300
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:11,598
<font color=#FFFF00>- Look who's here. - Dong Hui.</font>

301
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:12,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

302
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:14,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What a surprise!</font>

303
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Is that you, Dong Hui?</font>

304
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:18,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

305
00:16:18,968 --> 00:16:20,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really Dong Hui.</font>

306
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:22,128
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while.</font>

307
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, what happened?</font>

308
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,968
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dong Hui! My Dong Hui. - Stop it.</font>

309
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I missed you so much.</font>

310
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:33,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Please let go of me.</font>

311
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:36,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. I want to see Dong Hui's face.</font>

312
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- No, I won't. - Let go.</font>

313
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:39,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh, he's funny.</font>

314
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:41,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

315
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

316
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:45,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you are doing?</font>

317
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:47,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you welcoming Dong Hui now?</font>

318
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,068
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been off the grid for two months.</font>

319
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:52,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, how ungrateful can you get?</font>

320
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,028
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you come back here like this?</font>

321
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it. What's wrong with you?</font>

322
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, we were worried about you.</font>

323
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:02,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What happened?</font>

324
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:04,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry to have worried you.</font>

325
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:08,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing happened. It was just something personal.</font>

326
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Something personal?</font>

327
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,068
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you do this?</font>

328
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:14,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Is office your playground?</font>

329
00:17:14,568 --> 00:17:15,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this a place you can come and go as you please?</font>

330
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:18,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think you can just not come if things come up?</font>

331
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:21,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry. I am really sorry.</font>

332
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:27,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What's up with all the fuss?</font>

333
00:17:27,368 --> 00:17:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Director Han. Look.</font>

334
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui is here.</font>

335
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:33,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui came to work.</font>

336
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, Director Han.</font>

337
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:41,638
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui.</font>

338
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I see you in my office?</font>

339
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Sure.</font>

340
00:17:52,398 --> 00:17:53,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- I'm surprised. - What?</font>

341
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Why isn't Director Han surprised to see her?</font>

342
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:59,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you think it is? He just can't believe it. Goodness.</font>

343
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:02,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway, I'm so happy Dong Hui's back.</font>

344
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What's so happy about it?</font>

345
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:07,098
<font color=#FFFF00>We don't have to worry about not having the script now.</font>

346
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you come to work?</font>

347
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,368
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that you can't put your guard down just yet.</font>

348
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I know.</font>

349
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:16,198
<font color=#FFFF00>But I thought hard about it.</font>

350
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,138
<font color=#FFFF00>I think this is better.</font>

351
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I am the person Gwang Jin wants to hide.</font>

352
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I need to be all over the place...</font>

353
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,528
<font color=#FFFF00>to draw his attention.</font>

354
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:29,068
<font color=#FFFF00>And that will make you freer.</font>

355
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:32,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, but this is still too dangerous.</font>

356
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:35,138
<font color=#FFFF00>No, I can really do this.</font>

357
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,898
<font color=#FFFF00>The heiress who doesn't have anything and has no hope...</font>

358
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,138
<font color=#FFFF00>can be good too.</font>

359
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:42,298
<font color=#FFFF00>The lowest rank employee can be good too.</font>

360
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:44,798
<font color=#FFFF00>So don't worry about me,</font>

361
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,828
<font color=#FFFF00>and you should be careful.</font>

362
00:18:47,068 --> 00:18:48,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that, right?</font>

363
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What? Did you say Dong Hui came to work?</font>

364
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:05,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

365
00:19:07,068 --> 00:19:10,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Is she out of her mind?</font>

366
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That means it will be easier...</font>

367
00:19:12,468 --> 00:19:14,568
<font color=#FFFF00>for us to watch her. So it's good for us.</font>

368
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:16,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

369
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:20,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Watch who she talks to. Watch her well.</font>

370
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:24,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I have locked her up...</font>

371
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,998
<font color=#FFFF00>with Mother?</font>

372
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:28,598
<font color=#FFFF00>There's no need.</font>

373
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you just have to get a hold of Seong Joon?</font>

374
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:37,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the point of locking up the heiress without any share...</font>

375
00:19:37,068 --> 00:19:39,268
<font color=#FFFF00>and make her get full of herself?</font>

376
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Just let her continue being the low-rank employee.</font>

377
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:45,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, she will know her place.</font>

378
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. You are right.</font>

379
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

380
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Mi Joo, are you certain...</font>

381
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:57,168
<font color=#FFFF00>that you are over Seong Joon now?</font>

382
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

383
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't bear it anymore.</font>

384
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:05,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't watch Dong Hui acting like the unfortunate heiress...</font>

385
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:07,168
<font color=#FFFF00>or Seong Joon...</font>

386
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,798
<font color=#FFFF00>planning all of this for her.</font>

387
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

388
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:14,138
<font color=#FFFF00>Now...</font>

389
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:17,598
<font color=#FFFF00>you are coming to your senses. This is how it's supposed to be.</font>

390
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:19,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Only then, this company will become yours.</font>

391
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:23,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know...</font>

392
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:26,168
<font color=#FFFF00>UN Production?</font>

393
00:20:27,638 --> 00:20:28,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

394
00:20:31,568 --> 00:20:32,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

395
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

396
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you so surprised?</font>

397
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I've come...</font>

398
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:43,298
<font color=#FFFF00>to talk to you.</font>

399
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:46,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard...</font>

400
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:49,268
<font color=#FFFF00>you hid Seong Joon away.</font>

401
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:50,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

402
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:53,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't hide him away.</font>

403
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:56,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I went through the official procedure to...</font>

404
00:20:56,828 --> 00:20:57,998
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

405
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:00,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry, sir.</font>

406
00:21:02,098 --> 00:21:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>But it was a shame...</font>

407
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,428
<font color=#FFFF00>for us to give up on Seong Joon.</font>

408
00:21:08,998 --> 00:21:10,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't give him up.</font>

409
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:12,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Kill him.</font>

410
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

411
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:18,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of a strange rumor,</font>

412
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,168
<font color=#FFFF00>my company's stocks are...</font>

413
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:23,328
<font color=#FFFF00>hitting the daily permissible ceiling.</font>

414
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:28,168
<font color=#FFFF00>It makes me feel very bad.</font>

415
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You know...</font>

416
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:34,798
<font color=#FFFF00>that I acknowledge you...</font>

417
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:36,698
<font color=#FFFF00>as a good businessman, right?</font>

418
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:39,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. Thank you, sir.</font>

419
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I will make you earn the money...</font>

420
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:44,898
<font color=#FFFF00>you were trying to earn through Seong Joon.</font>

421
00:21:46,328 --> 00:21:47,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir?</font>

422
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:49,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You should...</font>

423
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,528
<font color=#FFFF00>buy our company's stocks.</font>

424
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:55,168
<font color=#FFFF00>The whole lot.</font>

425
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:04,568
<font color=#FFFF00>If you knew that, you should've stopped Seong Joon.</font>

426
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:08,368
<font color=#FFFF00>How can you not stop your little brother?</font>

427
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you have a big company, and you are a good entrepreneur.</font>

428
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:14,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've stopped your brother.</font>

429
00:22:14,698 --> 00:22:16,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What's good about having a family?</font>

430
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't it good because you can help each other in times of trouble?</font>

431
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:24,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is very stubborn.</font>

432
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:26,698
<font color=#FFFF00>If he thinks something is right,</font>

433
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>he wouldn't stop even if he's threatened to death.</font>

434
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:30,928
<font color=#FFFF00>And now...</font>

435
00:22:31,528 --> 00:22:35,168
<font color=#FFFF00>his entire family is about to be forced out onto the streets.</font>

436
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:37,868
<font color=#FFFF00>He would gladly sell his body for us.</font>

437
00:22:40,168 --> 00:22:42,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think I didn't stop him?</font>

438
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:43,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I already tried stopping him.</font>

439
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:46,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You should've stopped him well.</font>

440
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun said it's very dangerous to be involved in this.</font>

441
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard that company is very bad.</font>

442
00:22:53,768 --> 00:22:56,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think there's anyone else in our family...</font>

443
00:22:56,368 --> 00:22:58,468
<font color=#FFFF00>who can function as a person?</font>

444
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:03,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Because of his pathetic family,</font>

445
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:05,828
<font color=#FFFF00>he's living a pathetic life.</font>

446
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:08,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You are his brother. Do you want to let him work...</font>

447
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:09,598
<font color=#FFFF00>for that dangerous company?</font>

448
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:12,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo, say something.</font>

449
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Gray Hair's here again.</font>

450
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You must be a set.</font>

451
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:25,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello, ma'am.</font>

452
00:23:27,768 --> 00:23:28,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

453
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I said everything I needed to say. So I will be going now.</font>

454
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:34,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't forget what I said...</font>

455
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,198
<font color=#FFFF00>and please persuade Seong Joon.</font>

456
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you understand?</font>

457
00:23:38,428 --> 00:23:39,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll get going now.</font>

458
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,428
<font color=#FFFF00>That family is truly unbelievable.</font>

459
00:23:53,868 --> 00:23:55,428
<font color=#FFFF00>One day, the grandmother came,</font>

460
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,228
<font color=#FFFF00>and today, the mother came.</font>

461
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:00,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I be thankful to them...</font>

462
00:24:00,928 --> 00:24:02,998
<font color=#FFFF00>for being so worried about Sang Woo?</font>

463
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:07,868
<font color=#FFFF00>And why am I getting scolded by them?</font>

464
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:10,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did she come?</font>

465
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:15,398
<font color=#FFFF00>She came to ask me to stop Sang Woo from working for UN Production.</font>

466
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,298
<font color=#FFFF00>They won't let Sang Woo work for such a dangerous company.</font>

467
00:24:18,768 --> 00:24:19,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

468
00:24:20,498 --> 00:24:23,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Something even more serious than that just happened.</font>

469
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Last time, I told you some people are trying to...</font>

470
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:29,268
<font color=#FFFF00>bring back Chairwoman Park Chang Wook to FGC.</font>

471
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard Sang Woo is involved in it.</font>

472
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:36,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

473
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,098
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

474
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo?</font>

475
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:41,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he do that?</font>

476
00:24:42,228 --> 00:24:43,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know.</font>

477
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know the reason.</font>

478
00:24:47,298 --> 00:24:48,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would he do that?</font>

479
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Doesn't he know who Gwang Jin is?</font>

480
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:54,328
<font color=#FFFF00>He would do anything for his own interest.</font>

481
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How can he become Gwang Jin's enemy?</font>

482
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:00,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You should meet him...</font>

483
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,128
<font color=#FFFF00>and talk to him in person.</font>

484
00:25:03,898 --> 00:25:04,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

485
00:25:07,068 --> 00:25:09,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo doesn't even want to see me now.</font>

486
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:12,898
<font color=#FFFF00>We fought again last time because of this area.</font>

487
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:16,228
<font color=#FFFF00>You still have to meet him. You have to ask him the reason...</font>

488
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:19,068
<font color=#FFFF00>and help him to plan the escape.</font>

489
00:25:27,498 --> 00:25:28,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Ta-da.</font>

490
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,568
<font color=#FFFF00>This is for you.</font>

491
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,398
<font color=#FFFF00>What is that? Why did you buy pyjamas?</font>

492
00:25:34,128 --> 00:25:36,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Wait.</font>

493
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,668
<font color=#FFFF00>This is for you.</font>

494
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:43,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

495
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:46,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What are all these for?</font>

496
00:25:46,428 --> 00:25:47,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think?</font>

497
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:51,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a pyjama set for a newly wed couple.</font>

498
00:25:51,098 --> 00:25:52,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

499
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,398
<font color=#FFFF00>They are...</font>

500
00:25:55,498 --> 00:25:56,798
<font color=#FFFF00>matching pyjamas...</font>

501
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:59,668
<font color=#FFFF00>for a newly wed couple.</font>

502
00:26:00,268 --> 00:26:03,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt, isn't it so romantic?</font>

503
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:06,128
<font color=#FFFF00>How is it romantic?</font>

504
00:26:06,128 --> 00:26:08,168
<font color=#FFFF00>- Goodness. - I love it.</font>

505
00:26:08,168 --> 00:26:09,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

506
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:12,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Shouldn't you be wearing a hospital outfit?</font>

507
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:13,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You are going to die soon.</font>

508
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:19,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt, don't say that.</font>

509
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:22,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't say such thing.</font>

510
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:25,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You promised to get along well...</font>

511
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:26,668
<font color=#FFFF00>for the next three months.</font>

512
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

513
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:31,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I told him he could stay here. I never said we'd get along well.</font>

514
00:26:31,098 --> 00:26:32,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Come on, Aunt.</font>

515
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I think this is just wrong.</font>

516
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:39,668
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't show his face for 30 years.</font>

517
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,628
<font color=#FFFF00>And he appeared again just before dying.</font>

518
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you think it makes sense?</font>

519
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:44,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he an elephant?</font>

520
00:26:44,828 --> 00:26:47,698
<font color=#FFFF00>They go back to their forest on time for their death.</font>

521
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

522
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Your tragic fate.</font>

523
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:58,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Think of your tragic fate.</font>

524
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,698
<font color=#FFFF00>That fate isn't for everyone.</font>

525
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:04,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You have to be beautiful and graceful.</font>

526
00:27:04,898 --> 00:27:08,568
<font color=#FFFF00>And you need the first love you can never forget.</font>

527
00:27:08,898 --> 00:27:11,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You're the only one in Korea...</font>

528
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,698
<font color=#FFFF00>who meets all the three conditions.</font>

529
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:17,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You know you can't be this cynical.</font>

530
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:21,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized...</font>

531
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,668
<font color=#FFFF00>that everyone dies in the end.</font>

532
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt, come on.</font>

533
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:34,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- Dad. - Jeong Eun, you were here.</font>

534
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:37,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I closed the cafe late last night.</font>

535
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:40,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Are these yours?</font>

536
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:42,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. There aren't many, right?</font>

537
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:47,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you really live with us?</font>

538
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:48,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Mom say yes?</font>

539
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:51,268
<font color=#FFFF00>- Of course not. - Aunt.</font>

540
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:55,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun, what do you think?</font>

541
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:58,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Wouldn't they be like newlyweds if he moves in?</font>

542
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,568
<font color=#FFFF00>So I brought...</font>

543
00:28:00,628 --> 00:28:03,328
<font color=#FFFF00>- pyjamas for you two. Look. - Goodness.</font>

544
00:28:04,168 --> 00:28:06,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook...</font>

545
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook!</font>

546
00:28:14,228 --> 00:28:15,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun,</font>

547
00:28:15,798 --> 00:28:17,668
<font color=#FFFF00>why are you so slow-witted?</font>

548
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,628
<font color=#FFFF00>You must stay out of their business.</font>

549
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:22,928
<font color=#FFFF00>But I think it's too ridiculous.</font>

550
00:28:22,928 --> 00:28:25,698
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you tell Mom that my dad has a fatal illness?</font>

551
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,628
<font color=#FFFF00>How will you live with the consequences?</font>

552
00:28:27,828 --> 00:28:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not worry about it for now.</font>

553
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:33,598
<font color=#FFFF00>If they fall in love with each other again,</font>

554
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,528
<font color=#FFFF00>your mom would be happy...</font>

555
00:28:35,698 --> 00:28:38,328
<font color=#FFFF00>that he wouldn't die of an illness.</font>

556
00:28:39,568 --> 00:28:41,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Also, they'd appreciate...</font>

557
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,898
<font color=#FFFF00>that they got back together.</font>

558
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:46,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Hee Sook, you really know nothing about my mom.</font>

559
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,698
<font color=#FFFF00>If Dad doesn't die in three months,</font>

560
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:51,698
<font color=#FFFF00>she might kill him herself. Okay?</font>

561
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:54,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I just need you to stay quiet.</font>

562
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:57,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Eunha Contest which is Chang Soo's second contest...</font>

563
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,468
<font color=#FFFF00>will be held at the end of May.</font>

564
00:28:59,968 --> 00:29:01,568
<font color=#FFFF00>So let's leave it at that for now.</font>

565
00:29:02,128 --> 00:29:03,498
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - What?</font>

566
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Should I go back and live with you?</font>

567
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Can I just live with my current parents?</font>

568
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:09,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

569
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:11,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Say that again.</font>

570
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:14,698
<font color=#FFFF00>You know I wanted to just live with you back then.</font>

571
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I know you did.</font>

572
00:29:17,368 --> 00:29:21,068
<font color=#FFFF00>But you had no choice since Ji Hoon wanted to live with us.</font>

573
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Yet, if it hadn't happened,</font>

574
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:26,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I wouldn't have been able to become who I am now.</font>

575
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:27,828
<font color=#FFFF00>- What? - What?</font>

576
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Although I lived with my parents,</font>

577
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Han and Ms. Seo,</font>

578
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:34,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't know what I was good at...</font>

579
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,098
<font color=#FFFF00>and what I was talented in for 15 years.</font>

580
00:29:37,428 --> 00:29:40,228
<font color=#FFFF00>It was your teacher who recognized your talent,</font>

581
00:29:40,268 --> 00:29:41,768
<font color=#FFFF00>not Hee Sook.</font>

582
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, if it were you, do you think you would have been...</font>

583
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:48,098
<font color=#FFFF00>able to make me prove my capacity as a vocal singer?</font>

584
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:49,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not merely about money,</font>

585
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:52,428
<font color=#FFFF00>but about continuous parental care,</font>

586
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:55,668
<font color=#FFFF00>the amount of attention, and conviction.</font>

587
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:06,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Ae.</font>

588
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, where have you been?</font>

589
00:30:10,968 --> 00:30:12,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I went to church.</font>

590
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you pray today?</font>

591
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Would our family's financial condition be better soon?</font>

592
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I realized that we should focus on children's education.</font>

593
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:21,328
<font color=#FFFF00>It's not late yet.</font>

594
00:30:21,698 --> 00:30:22,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

595
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:25,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I stopped by Mr. Lee's house...</font>

596
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:27,368
<font color=#FFFF00>and went to the market.</font>

597
00:30:27,598 --> 00:30:28,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you visit Mr. Lee?</font>

598
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I went to get the glass containers for food from before.</font>

599
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:33,828
<font color=#FFFF00>I also needed to discuss with him about Seong Joon's matter.</font>

600
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:35,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you need to discuss about?</font>

601
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:38,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I told him that he should've stopped Seong Joon...</font>

602
00:30:38,768 --> 00:30:41,498
<font color=#FFFF00>as his older brother if he had known that Seong Joon was...</font>

603
00:30:41,868 --> 00:30:43,468
<font color=#FFFF00>engaged in such an illicit matter.</font>

604
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:45,928
<font color=#FFFF00>- You did? - Yes.</font>

605
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:48,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't visit him too often.</font>

606
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:50,168
<font color=#FFFF00>You might start liking him.</font>

607
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:52,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

608
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait. Am I a housekeeper or what?</font>

609
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do I wash dishes every day?</font>

610
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:07,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me think.</font>

611
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:09,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Didn't Hye Joo come home?</font>

612
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:12,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Why doesn't she show up in the kitchen at all?</font>

613
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:15,198
<font color=#FFFF00>And this is the most important.</font>

614
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:16,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

615
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:20,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I prefer Ms. Kang Hee Sook as my mother.</font>

616
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:23,498
<font color=#FFFF00>She's pretty, skinny, and fashionable.</font>

617
00:31:23,698 --> 00:31:25,428
<font color=#FFFF00>She even smells great.</font>

618
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:27,228
<font color=#FFFF00>She's a good cook as well.</font>

619
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry, honey.</font>

620
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,628
<font color=#FFFF00>She's very feminine too.</font>

621
00:31:34,028 --> 00:31:36,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I love it especially when she...</font>

622
00:31:36,468 --> 00:31:38,668
<font color=#FFFF00>calls me "Chang Soo" with her tone of voice.</font>

623
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:44,198
<font color=#FFFF00>You're such a jerk.</font>

624
00:31:44,228 --> 00:31:45,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you know how much love I gave you?</font>

625
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:50,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I even took you to my workplace.</font>

626
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I fed you and changed your diapers...</font>

627
00:31:52,128 --> 00:31:54,698
<font color=#FFFF00>in the company bathroom, you bad son.</font>

628
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,368
<font color=#FFFF00>- Honey... - Hye Joo.</font>

629
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>- Wait. Stop! - How...</font>

630
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,328
<font color=#FFFF00>It isn't just about me.</font>

631
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:04,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Think about Ji Hoon. He'd suffocate if he lives with his former mom.</font>

632
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:06,128
<font color=#FFFF00>That's true though.</font>

633
00:32:07,568 --> 00:32:08,798
<font color=#FFFF00>- Father. - Dad.</font>

634
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:10,528
<font color=#FFFF00>But her education style...</font>

635
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,698
<font color=#FFFF00>fits me just right.</font>

636
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:13,998
<font color=#FFFF00>You'd better be quiet.</font>

637
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:16,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo is right.</font>

638
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Father.</font>

639
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:20,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, still...</font>

640
00:32:20,768 --> 00:32:23,368
<font color=#FFFF00>What if Hee Sook finds out that Chang Soo and Ji Hoon...</font>

641
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:24,798
<font color=#FFFF00>weren't actually switched?</font>

642
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:27,828
<font color=#FFFF00>That'd be horrible.</font>

643
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:33,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh. What are they talking about?</font>

644
00:32:35,268 --> 00:32:37,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. Grandmother.</font>

645
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on outside?</font>

646
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:44,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- Isn't it Jeong Hwa? - This is unbelievable.</font>

647
00:32:44,968 --> 00:32:46,668
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the matter?</font>

648
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:50,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo and Ji Hoon...</font>

649
00:32:50,828 --> 00:32:53,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What's going on this time?</font>

650
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:54,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Be quiet.</font>

651
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing. Please don't mind us.</font>

652
00:33:01,868 --> 00:33:04,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom, Chang Soo and Ji Hoon weren't switched.</font>

653
00:33:05,268 --> 00:33:08,028
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stay out of this. - Get off.</font>

654
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:10,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo and Ji Hoon weren't switched in the first place.</font>

655
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:12,828
<font color=#FFFF00>It was just a lie.</font>

656
00:33:14,068 --> 00:33:15,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

657
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:21,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt,</font>

658
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:25,898
<font color=#FFFF00>you can't say that to them.</font>

659
00:33:33,468 --> 00:33:36,568
<font color=#FFFF00>So they haven't been switched even once?</font>

660
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:39,568
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right, Mom.</font>

661
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:41,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe...</font>

662
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:44,568
<font color=#FFFF00>that he came up with such a dreadful scheme.</font>

663
00:33:45,028 --> 00:33:47,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Ji Hoon's uncle is a really bad guy.</font>

664
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't stand this.</font>

665
00:33:48,868 --> 00:33:50,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Just calm down.</font>

666
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:52,868
<font color=#FFFF00>We told you.</font>

667
00:33:53,468 --> 00:33:55,898
<font color=#FFFF00>He didn't want Ji Hoon to suffer the same fate as his daughter.</font>

668
00:33:55,898 --> 00:33:58,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Still, how could he tell us such ridiculous lie...</font>

669
00:33:58,368 --> 00:33:59,798
<font color=#FFFF00>as a doctor?</font>

670
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:00,998
<font color=#FFFF00>It's your fault as well.</font>

671
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You're involved in every complicated issue...</font>

672
00:34:03,828 --> 00:34:06,698
<font color=#FFFF00>about our family members' birth. It's unbelievable.</font>

673
00:34:06,828 --> 00:34:09,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Why do you bring that up now?</font>

674
00:34:09,598 --> 00:34:12,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, look how sly he is.</font>

675
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:15,128
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I warned you before you got married to him.</font>

676
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:17,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you to be careful as he's quiet...</font>

677
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:19,628
<font color=#FFFF00>but sly.</font>

678
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:21,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

679
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:24,098
<font color=#FFFF00>So what should we do with this?</font>

680
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:27,428
<font color=#FFFF00>How can a problem occur after another?</font>

681
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:28,968
<font color=#FFFF00>What is this?</font>

682
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you decide to make my life so dynamic?</font>

683
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:33,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Even if that was the case,</font>

684
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:37,668
<font color=#FFFF00>you two, who were totally fooled, are idiots.</font>

685
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I said be quiet.</font>

686
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,198
<font color=#FFFF00>So what do we do?</font>

687
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:43,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you switch your kids back?</font>

688
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,228
<font color=#FFFF00>That's impossible, Grandmother.</font>

689
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:49,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo wants to stay with Hee Sook.</font>

690
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:52,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I have no idea what we should do with Ji Hoon.</font>

691
00:34:52,198 --> 00:34:54,368
<font color=#FFFF00>If we tell Ji Hoon to live...</font>

692
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:58,068
<font color=#FFFF00>with Hee Sook,</font>

693
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,698
<font color=#FFFF00>he'll get stressed out.</font>

694
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:03,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother, still...</font>

695
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,468
<font color=#FFFF00>This isn't right. It's ridiculous.</font>

696
00:35:06,468 --> 00:35:08,128
<font color=#FFFF00>This is total nonsense.</font>

697
00:35:11,768 --> 00:35:14,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't we just let them live the way they are now?</font>

698
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:17,368
<font color=#FFFF00>That's out of the question. I need you to be quiet!</font>

699
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:20,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm worried about Ji Hoon though.</font>

700
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:22,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you all doing here?</font>

701
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:26,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Is this a family meeting?</font>

702
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:28,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Why didn't you call me then?</font>

703
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

704
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,868
<font color=#FFFF00>We should put soybean paste and chilli paste in the fridge.</font>

705
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:35,628
<font color=#FFFF00>That's right. I almost forgot, Mother.</font>

706
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,568
<font color=#FFFF00>- Me too. - We must put them in the fridge.</font>

707
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Chang Soo, go make your bed.</font>

708
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Right. I will, Aunt.</font>

709
00:35:42,128 --> 00:35:43,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Hold on...</font>

710
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you all leaving?</font>

711
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:47,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Did Seong Sik open the restaurant?</font>

712
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:50,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad, I'll go to work now.</font>

713
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

714
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:53,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you all leaving all of a sudden?</font>

715
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:56,098
<font color=#FFFF00>- That's right. - Did something happen?</font>

716
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:59,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me tell you. What happened...</font>

717
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You must help us now.</font>

718
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:05,068
<font color=#FFFF00>- How can you be so lazy? - Mom!</font>

719
00:36:05,128 --> 00:36:08,068
<font color=#FFFF00>All you do is idling, you lazy wench.</font>

720
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,268
<font color=#FFFF00>(Sang Woo)</font>

721
00:36:26,328 --> 00:36:27,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Sir.</font>

722
00:36:28,168 --> 00:36:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you all right?</font>

723
00:36:31,128 --> 00:36:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm fine.</font>

724
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:37,498
<font color=#FFFF00>We've received an official document from FGC.</font>

725
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:40,038
<font color=#FFFF00>I think Chairman Bang plans to disclose...</font>

726
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:42,368
<font color=#FFFF00>the former chairwoman's will...</font>

727
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,328
<font color=#FFFF00>in the upcoming general meeting for stockholders.</font>

728
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:48,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

729
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What on earth is Sang Woo up to?</font>

730
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:53,898
<font color=#FFFF00>If our guess is right,</font>

731
00:36:54,098 --> 00:36:57,068
<font color=#FFFF00>the day of the general meeting would the D-Day.</font>

732
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you stop here?</font>

733
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:23,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you ask for help?</font>

734
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,798
<font color=#FFFF00>The only person who can help you is...</font>

735
00:37:27,598 --> 00:37:29,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun, isn't it?</font>

736
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:55,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you here, Hyun Woo? I was expecting Mr. Jo.</font>

737
00:37:58,098 --> 00:37:59,298
<font color=#FFFF00>He fooled me.</font>

738
00:38:01,128 --> 00:38:02,198
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

739
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:06,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Mr. Jo has set this up.</font>

740
00:38:08,038 --> 00:38:09,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I can't believe him.</font>

741
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:12,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did he set this up though?</font>

742
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:14,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you ask him to?</font>

743
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:28,268
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard you have something to discuss about the shop.</font>

744
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:40,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Why did you tell his family what Sang Woo did?</font>

745
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:43,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo. You asked me to do so.</font>

746
00:38:43,498 --> 00:38:45,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You wanted me to persuade Seong Joon.</font>

747
00:38:47,128 --> 00:38:49,928
<font color=#FFFF00>He's not easily persuaded.</font>

748
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:53,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother has to collapse,</font>

749
00:38:53,228 --> 00:38:54,668
<font color=#FFFF00>his mother has to yell at him,</font>

750
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,668
<font color=#FFFF00>and his brothers have to scold him...</font>

751
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,668
<font color=#FFFF00>if you want to persuade him.</font>

752
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:02,228
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

753
00:39:02,698 --> 00:39:04,568
<font color=#FFFF00>is he going to get out of the contract?</font>

754
00:39:06,298 --> 00:39:08,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I am not sure about that yet.</font>

755
00:39:09,228 --> 00:39:10,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what's going on with him,</font>

756
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,068
<font color=#FFFF00>but it's hard to see Seong Joon nowadays.</font>

757
00:39:17,468 --> 00:39:18,968
<font color=#FFFF00>They are much better than I am.</font>

758
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,168
<font color=#FFFF00>His family is better.</font>

759
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:31,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, do you want to hear a funny story?</font>

760
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:34,998
<font color=#FFFF00>When I was young, I had...</font>

761
00:39:35,198 --> 00:39:37,998
<font color=#FFFF00>a big fight with Jeong Hwa. We were pulling each other's hair.</font>

762
00:39:38,368 --> 00:39:40,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Out of all the times, when we were fighting,</font>

763
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:43,168
<font color=#FFFF00>our grandmother gave us some money...</font>

764
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:44,868
<font color=#FFFF00>and told us to buy ourselves a corn dog.</font>

765
00:39:45,198 --> 00:39:46,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you know what we did?</font>

766
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,628
<font color=#FFFF00>We stopped fighting.</font>

767
00:39:50,298 --> 00:39:53,998
<font color=#FFFF00>We took the money and held each other's hand.</font>

768
00:39:53,998 --> 00:39:55,598
<font color=#FFFF00>We went to buy a corn dog.</font>

769
00:39:58,428 --> 00:39:59,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Are all women like you?</font>

770
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,898
<font color=#FFFF00>No, that's how families are.</font>

771
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:07,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon and Seong Sik fought...</font>

772
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:08,698
<font color=#FFFF00>a lot when they were young too.</font>

773
00:40:08,868 --> 00:40:11,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik was crying because Seong Hoon beat him up,</font>

774
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,268
<font color=#FFFF00>but when Seong Hoon said he was going to buy some toys,</font>

775
00:40:14,268 --> 00:40:16,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Sik stopped crying and followed me.</font>

776
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:19,898
<font color=#FFFF00>They were childish.</font>

777
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:23,538
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

778
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:26,038
<font color=#FFFF00>It was because they were family.</font>

779
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,128
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

780
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't know what happened between you and Seong Joon.</font>

781
00:40:35,228 --> 00:40:38,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you go and see Seong Joon?</font>

782
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,038
<font color=#FFFF00>He...</font>

783
00:40:43,328 --> 00:40:44,628
<font color=#FFFF00>doesn't like me.</font>

784
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:46,568
<font color=#FFFF00>No, that's not true.</font>

785
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:50,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Hyun Woo.</font>

786
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Fights between siblings always happen.</font>

787
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:56,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Everyone fights with their siblings.</font>

788
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It's nothing special.</font>

789
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:00,228
<font color=#FFFF00>So...</font>

790
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:02,698
<font color=#FFFF00>just like we went to buy a corn dog...</font>

791
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:05,038
<font color=#FFFF00>and to buy some toys,</font>

792
00:41:05,768 --> 00:41:09,428
<font color=#FFFF00>you should go and see Seong Joon. Okay?</font>

793
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:20,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean you are in charge of managing Golden Street, a conglomerate.</font>

794
00:41:20,698 --> 00:41:22,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Yet, you don't know what to do with your brother.</font>

795
00:41:22,698 --> 00:41:25,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Isn't showing your unconfident side of you...</font>

796
00:41:25,928 --> 00:41:27,268
<font color=#FFFF00>to me embarrassing?</font>

797
00:41:35,198 --> 00:41:36,968
<font color=#FFFF00>You are still...</font>

798
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:40,228
<font color=#FFFF00>not good at things other people do easily.</font>

799
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:43,768
<font color=#FFFF00>That made me...</font>

800
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:46,698
<font color=#FFFF00>pity you.</font>

801
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,328
<font color=#FFFF00>That was one of your charms.</font>

802
00:41:58,828 --> 00:42:00,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Please go if everything is settled.</font>

803
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:03,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to go and clean up the coffee shop.</font>

804
00:42:04,328 --> 00:42:08,068
<font color=#FFFF00>You know that I will be running the shop until the end of April, right?</font>

805
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:15,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Thanks to Mr. Jo,</font>

806
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:17,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I get to walk looking at these cherry blossoms.</font>

807
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:22,038
<font color=#FFFF00>Jeong Eun.</font>

808
00:42:23,368 --> 00:42:24,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

809
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:27,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Can't you just continue running the shop?</font>

810
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:29,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

811
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:33,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I told you I don't want to. I told you we are done.</font>

812
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:39,298
<font color=#FFFF00>That's how I can keep visiting the shop.</font>

813
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:41,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Sorry?</font>

814
00:43:02,598 --> 00:43:03,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

815
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:06,538
<font color=#FFFF00>Something is going on.</font>

816
00:43:07,098 --> 00:43:08,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

817
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:09,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it now?</font>

818
00:43:10,898 --> 00:43:11,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness!</font>

819
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:15,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I have to count them again.</font>

820
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:18,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't you think so?</font>

821
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:19,928
<font color=#FFFF00>About what?</font>

822
00:43:19,968 --> 00:43:21,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm talking about our family.</font>

823
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,498
<font color=#FFFF00>They are definitely...</font>

824
00:43:25,628 --> 00:43:28,228
<font color=#FFFF00>hiding something from me.</font>

825
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:30,968
<font color=#FFFF00>No way. Who is it? Why?</font>

826
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:34,628
<font color=#FFFF00>How can they deceive you? It's harder than deceiving a ghost.</font>

827
00:43:34,928 --> 00:43:37,128
<font color=#FFFF00>You can even find all of my secret funds.</font>

828
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Who on earth can hide things from you?</font>

829
00:43:40,098 --> 00:43:41,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

830
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:43,198
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

831
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:46,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I have a hunch.</font>

832
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:48,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

833
00:43:50,498 --> 00:43:51,968
<font color=#FFFF00>I think...</font>

834
00:43:52,298 --> 00:43:55,668
<font color=#FFFF00>they are hiding something from me.</font>

835
00:44:00,428 --> 00:44:01,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey.</font>

836
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:04,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I was going to die today.</font>

837
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:08,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Your mom got so close to finding out everything.</font>

838
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:09,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

839
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:11,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness.</font>

840
00:44:12,268 --> 00:44:13,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do?</font>

841
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,098
<font color=#FFFF00>As of right now,</font>

842
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,398
<font color=#FFFF00>everyone in the house found out except for your mom and dad.</font>

843
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:21,368
<font color=#FFFF00>How did that happen?</font>

844
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Well...</font>

845
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:24,868
<font color=#FFFF00>It sort of happened that way.</font>

846
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:31,168
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you going to do about this?</font>

847
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I thought I was going to have a heart attack.</font>

848
00:44:33,428 --> 00:44:34,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What is your plan?</font>

849
00:44:35,228 --> 00:44:36,228
<font color=#FFFF00>Aunt.</font>

850
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:40,228
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really scared. What do I do?</font>

851
00:44:41,898 --> 00:44:43,828
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness, you brat.</font>

852
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:47,928
<font color=#FFFF00>What am I going to do with you?</font>

853
00:44:51,598 --> 00:44:53,028
<font color=#FFFF00>- Are you having fun? - Yes.</font>

854
00:44:53,028 --> 00:44:54,298
<font color=#FFFF00>- How about you, Ye Bin? - I'm having fun too.</font>

855
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you?</font>

856
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:58,568
<font color=#FFFF00>This time, why don't you get on an airplane?</font>

857
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon.</font>

858
00:45:07,898 --> 00:45:10,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I was just playing with Ah In and Ye Bin.</font>

859
00:45:11,198 --> 00:45:14,028
<font color=#FFFF00>Go to your great-grandma. Stop bothering your uncle.</font>

860
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:15,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Yes, Grandma. - Yes, Grandma.</font>

861
00:45:17,628 --> 00:45:18,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a seat here.</font>

862
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:20,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

863
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,368
<font color=#FFFF00>The company you signed to join...</font>

864
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:31,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

865
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:33,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Let me finish.</font>

866
00:45:34,128 --> 00:45:35,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't join the company.</font>

867
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:38,568
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard it's a nasty company.</font>

868
00:45:39,398 --> 00:45:41,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad. You don't have to worry about it.</font>

869
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:44,328
<font color=#FFFF00>How can we not worry about it?</font>

870
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:47,128
<font color=#FFFF00>We can't stop worrying about it since we have found out everything.</font>

871
00:45:47,468 --> 00:45:50,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you go to that horrible company with your competence?</font>

872
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom. I'm fine.</font>

873
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:54,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I will do a good job.</font>

874
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:56,668
<font color=#FFFF00>It isn't about whether you will do a good job or not.</font>

875
00:45:56,668 --> 00:45:58,268
<font color=#FFFF00>The company is the problem.</font>

876
00:45:59,568 --> 00:46:01,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Let's not drag this out.</font>

877
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:03,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Get out of that contract right away.</font>

878
00:46:04,168 --> 00:46:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Dad.</font>

879
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to him.</font>

880
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:10,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing bad comes from listening to your parents, Seong Joon.</font>

881
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes?</font>

882
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:24,998
<font color=#FFFF00>This is Hyun Woo. I'm in front of your house.</font>

883
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:27,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Can you come out for a second?</font>

884
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Hey, is it your brother?</font>

885
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:33,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Go meet him.</font>

886
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:37,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't be so stubborn. Go meet your brother.</font>

887
00:47:04,928 --> 00:47:07,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You were probably resting. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.</font>

888
00:47:08,598 --> 00:47:09,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's okay.</font>

889
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:13,328
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is...</font>

890
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't mean to check up on you.</font>

891
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,428
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just what I do.</font>

892
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:21,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I happened to know things about FGC.</font>

893
00:47:22,768 --> 00:47:23,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I see.</font>

894
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you helping Chairwoman Park...</font>

895
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:29,898
<font color=#FFFF00>prepare for her return?</font>

896
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I am.</font>

897
00:47:37,528 --> 00:47:39,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Do you even know how dangerous it is?</font>

898
00:47:40,168 --> 00:47:41,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I do.</font>

899
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:44,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Why would you do this knowing all that?</font>

900
00:47:46,498 --> 00:47:48,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me, so I can help you.</font>

901
00:47:49,468 --> 00:47:50,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Chairwoman Park...</font>

902
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:52,768
<font color=#FFFF00>is alive.</font>

903
00:47:53,528 --> 00:47:55,298
<font color=#FFFF00>She's been in confinement for 20 years.</font>

904
00:47:56,398 --> 00:47:59,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm just trying to make things right.</font>

905
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:00,828
<font color=#FFFF00>So why do you have to do that?</font>

906
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:03,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Bang Gwang Jin isn't a person you can deal with.</font>

907
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:05,598
<font color=#FFFF00>It seems okay as he hasn't noticed it,</font>

908
00:48:09,468 --> 00:48:12,198
<font color=#FFFF00>but once he finds it out, you will be in danger.</font>

909
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:17,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you doing this...</font>

910
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:20,598
<font color=#FFFF00>knowing all that?</font>

911
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:23,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

912
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:26,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You'll be in danger. You can't do this.</font>

913
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:28,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Listen to me.</font>

914
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:30,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

915
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,698
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll wrap things up with UN Production...</font>

916
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:35,798
<font color=#FFFF00>when this is finished.</font>

917
00:48:36,598 --> 00:48:38,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I didn't really think that through.</font>

918
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:40,868
<font color=#FFFF00>It turns out you were right about that.</font>

919
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:42,898
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

920
00:48:43,698 --> 00:48:44,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You made the right decision.</font>

921
00:48:45,868 --> 00:48:48,328
<font color=#FFFF00>- So about FGC... - But I have to...</font>

922
00:48:49,828 --> 00:48:50,898
<font color=#FFFF00>do this no matter what.</font>

923
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:52,898
<font color=#FFFF00>- Sang Woo. - Hyun Woo.</font>

924
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:55,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it. It'll be all right.</font>

925
00:48:57,228 --> 00:48:58,528
<font color=#FFFF00>It has to be all right.</font>

926
00:48:58,928 --> 00:49:00,868
<font color=#FFFF00>No, you can't do that.</font>

927
00:49:01,298 --> 00:49:02,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Anyway,</font>

928
00:49:03,198 --> 00:49:04,698
<font color=#FFFF00>thank you for your concern.</font>

929
00:49:09,128 --> 00:49:10,128
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo.</font>

930
00:49:14,428 --> 00:49:15,898
<font color=#FFFF00>I just met Sang Woo.</font>

931
00:49:17,128 --> 00:49:19,398
<font color=#FFFF00>As I expected, he doesn't listen to me.</font>

932
00:49:21,198 --> 00:49:23,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Have the analysis team study every move FGC makes...</font>

933
00:49:23,998 --> 00:49:25,698
<font color=#FFFF00>and report it by tomorrow morning.</font>

934
00:49:26,198 --> 00:49:28,198
<font color=#FFFF00>And I need to see you now.</font>

935
00:49:28,928 --> 00:49:29,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

936
00:49:35,668 --> 00:49:36,968
<font color=#FFFF00>Hello.</font>

937
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Here.</font>

938
00:49:50,928 --> 00:49:52,268
<font color=#FFFF00>It's been a while, Dong Hui.</font>

939
00:49:52,828 --> 00:49:55,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. I'm sorry for coming here at this late hour.</font>

940
00:49:56,998 --> 00:50:00,068
<font color=#FFFF00>It's all right. I just met Sang Woo.</font>

941
00:50:01,028 --> 00:50:02,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Sang Woo?</font>

942
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:06,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Seong Joon's real name Sang Woo?</font>

943
00:50:06,898 --> 00:50:09,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Lee Sang Woo and Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

944
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:20,098
<font color=#FFFF00>In fact, I'm here to ask you a favor.</font>

945
00:50:23,698 --> 00:50:27,498
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't even know where to start.</font>

946
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:31,868
<font color=#FFFF00>The thing is, Seong Joon is in danger.</font>

947
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon is helping my grandmother,</font>

948
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,398
<font color=#FFFF00>I mean,</font>

949
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:42,868
<font color=#FFFF00>he's helping Chairwoman Park of FGC prepare for her return.</font>

950
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:46,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Is Chairwoman Park...</font>

951
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,868
<font color=#FFFF00>your grandmother?</font>

952
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:52,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes. She's my grandmother.</font>

953
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:57,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I understand.</font>

954
00:50:59,668 --> 00:51:02,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I understand why he's doing it taking all the risks.</font>

955
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:05,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you know about that?</font>

956
00:51:07,768 --> 00:51:08,768
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes.</font>

957
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,628
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I met Sang Woo earlier.</font>

958
00:51:13,898 --> 00:51:15,168
<font color=#FFFF00>I told him to stop,</font>

959
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:17,368
<font color=#FFFF00>but he wouldn't listen to me.</font>

960
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:20,668
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. It's too dangerous.</font>

961
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:24,198
<font color=#FFFF00>I don't want him to be put in danger because of me.</font>

962
00:51:24,568 --> 00:51:27,468
<font color=#FFFF00>All I want is to lead a quiet life...</font>

963
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:28,798
<font color=#FFFF00>with my two grandmothers.</font>

964
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,298
<font color=#FFFF00>But there's no other way to get my grandmother out of there.</font>

965
00:51:33,198 --> 00:51:36,768
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why Seong Joon is doing all that.</font>

966
00:51:39,368 --> 00:51:40,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I get it.</font>

967
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:42,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Now I understand...</font>

968
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,268
<font color=#FFFF00>what's happening.</font>

969
00:51:45,768 --> 00:51:47,628
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm very sorry.</font>

970
00:51:49,828 --> 00:51:51,098
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't have to be sorry.</font>

971
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:52,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm his brother.</font>

972
00:51:54,898 --> 00:51:56,428
<font color=#FFFF00>It's my duty as his brother.</font>

973
00:51:57,498 --> 00:51:59,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Instead, this is just between...</font>

974
00:52:00,028 --> 00:52:01,668
<font color=#FFFF00>the two of us.</font>

975
00:52:03,198 --> 00:52:04,398
<font color=#FFFF00>If Sang Woo finds everything out,</font>

976
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,068
<font color=#FFFF00>things will get more complicated.</font>

977
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:10,198
<font color=#FFFF00>It's late. I'll drive you home.</font>

978
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:13,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Where do you live now?</font>

979
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:17,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Well... It's...</font>

980
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:25,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

981
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:27,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard the house had been sold.</font>

982
00:52:27,998 --> 00:52:30,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you sure we can stay here?</font>

983
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry. I got permission.</font>

984
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:35,828
<font color=#FFFF00>How did you get permission?</font>

985
00:52:35,898 --> 00:52:38,828
<font color=#FFFF00>They've still got time until they tore down the house.</font>

986
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:41,128
<font color=#FFFF00>He said we can stay here until then.</font>

987
00:52:41,968 --> 00:52:44,928
<font color=#FFFF00>You saw that too. We still have doenjang, gochujang,</font>

988
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:46,868
<font color=#FFFF00>and even Moong Chi's still here.</font>

989
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:49,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother.</font>

990
00:52:50,528 --> 00:52:53,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Don't worry about it. Just have a seat.</font>

991
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:55,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

992
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:59,428
<font color=#FFFF00>I cleaned up the house yesterday.</font>

993
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Nothing has changed.</font>

994
00:53:06,068 --> 00:53:08,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Grandmother, do you want to lie down?</font>

995
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:10,128
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll make the bed.</font>

996
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:18,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Moong Chi, Grandma is here.</font>

997
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:30,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Why is the door left open?</font>

998
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:33,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

999
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:36,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Oh my gosh.</font>

1000
00:53:37,098 --> 00:53:39,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Elizabeth.</font>

1001
00:53:39,468 --> 00:53:42,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- Mi Ok. - My goodness.</font>

1002
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:46,568
<font color=#FFFF00>How long has it been?</font>

1003
00:53:46,898 --> 00:53:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>How have you been?</font>

1004
00:53:48,898 --> 00:53:51,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Where have you been the whole time?</font>

1005
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:53,568
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be so insensitive?</font>

1006
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:56,098
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you be so cold-hearted?</font>

1007
00:53:57,228 --> 00:53:58,598
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry.</font>

1008
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:01,028
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm really sorry.</font>

1009
00:54:01,098 --> 00:54:02,768
<font color=#FFFF00>My goodness.</font>

1010
00:54:05,798 --> 00:54:08,898
<font color=#FFFF00>How could you not call me even once...</font>

1011
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:12,298
<font color=#FFFF00>after leaving like that?</font>

1012
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm sorry about that.</font>

1013
00:54:15,698 --> 00:54:17,928
<font color=#FFFF00>I heard everything about you.</font>

1014
00:54:18,868 --> 00:54:20,398
<font color=#FFFF00>It's about my children,</font>

1015
00:54:20,828 --> 00:54:23,128
<font color=#FFFF00>so I don't know what to say.</font>

1016
00:54:23,568 --> 00:54:24,998
<font color=#FFFF00>They just...</font>

1017
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:28,328
<font color=#FFFF00>tried to do something for the best. What could I say?</font>

1018
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:30,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Now that things have happened,</font>

1019
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:33,328
<font color=#FFFF00>nothing can be retrieved.</font>

1020
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:36,668
<font color=#FFFF00>I just want us...</font>

1021
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:40,398
<font color=#FFFF00>to take good care of each other while we're alive.</font>

1022
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:42,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Then they will...</font>

1023
00:54:42,998 --> 00:54:44,898
<font color=#FFFF00>face the reality of life...</font>

1024
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:48,368
<font color=#FFFF00>with all the warm memories.</font>

1025
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right.</font>

1026
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:53,798
<font color=#FFFF00>I agree.</font>

1027
00:54:55,268 --> 00:54:58,998
<font color=#FFFF00>After you left, I've given it a lot of thought.</font>

1028
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:01,298
<font color=#FFFF00>It's just a young man...</font>

1029
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:04,768
<font color=#FFFF00>and a young woman liking each other.</font>

1030
00:55:05,668 --> 00:55:07,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What choice do I have?</font>

1031
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:12,598
<font color=#FFFF00>As the old folks tried to meddle in and stop them,</font>

1032
00:55:12,598 --> 00:55:13,928
<font color=#FFFF00>things have...</font>

1033
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:16,198
<font color=#FFFF00>ended up this way.</font>

1034
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:19,668
<font color=#FFFF00>So I was thinking...</font>

1035
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:21,698
<font color=#FFFF00>maybe we should...</font>

1036
00:55:22,098 --> 00:55:25,328
<font color=#FFFF00>let Seong Joon and Dong Hui marry...</font>

1037
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,868
<font color=#FFFF00>if they still love each other.</font>

1038
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:32,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1039
00:55:34,968 --> 00:55:36,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, what do you think?</font>

1040
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:38,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1041
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,468
<font color=#FFFF00>This is quite comfortable.</font>

1042
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I should sleep in this pyjama tonight.</font>

1043
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:02,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

1044
00:56:03,398 --> 00:56:06,528
<font color=#FFFF00>So newly wed couples wear same pyjamas like this?</font>

1045
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:08,898
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1046
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:11,628
<font color=#FFFF00>What else wouldn't I do for love?</font>

1047
00:56:14,128 --> 00:56:16,968
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way, is he out or what?</font>

1048
00:56:17,398 --> 00:56:18,868
<font color=#FFFF00>He said there'd be a recording.</font>

1049
00:56:19,868 --> 00:56:20,868
<font color=#FFFF00>Is he out?</font>

1050
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:23,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Gosh.</font>

1051
00:56:23,198 --> 00:56:26,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I said I'd let them get married, but why wouldn't they say anything?</font>

1052
00:56:26,668 --> 00:56:27,798
<font color=#FFFF00>That's ridiculous.</font>

1053
00:56:27,868 --> 00:56:30,468
<font color=#FFFF00>Are they rejecting my proposal?</font>

1054
00:56:30,668 --> 00:56:32,168
<font color=#FFFF00>Ae Ri, what are you doing?</font>

1055
00:56:33,698 --> 00:56:35,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Where are you? Are you in the kitchen?</font>

1056
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:40,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

1057
00:56:41,168 --> 00:56:42,428
<font color=#FFFF00>When did you come?</font>

1058
00:56:44,698 --> 00:56:46,468
<font color=#FFFF00>- Oh no. - Mother.</font>

1059
00:56:46,968 --> 00:56:48,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you think you are doing?</font>

1060
00:56:49,598 --> 00:56:50,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Mom.</font>

1061
00:56:51,098 --> 00:56:53,528
<font color=#FFFF00>Look at you. What are you doing?</font>

1062
00:56:53,528 --> 00:56:54,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you wearing same pyjamas?</font>

1063
00:56:54,868 --> 00:56:57,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you two get married without telling me?</font>

1064
00:56:58,398 --> 00:56:59,398
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk.</font>

1065
00:57:01,128 --> 00:57:03,128
<font color=#FFFF00>- Come here. - Mom, stop it.</font>

1066
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,598
<font color=#FFFF00>Stay out of my way.</font>

1067
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:06,728
<font color=#FFFF00>You jerk. I told you not to come ever again.</font>

1068
00:57:06,728 --> 00:57:10,398
<font color=#FFFF00>How dare you come here? I'll kill you.</font>

1069
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:11,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Mother.</font>

1070
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:13,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Stop it, Mom.</font>

1071
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:17,798
<font color=#FFFF00>He can only live...</font>

1072
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,768
<font color=#FFFF00>three more months.</font>

1073
00:57:22,468 --> 00:57:23,498
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1074
00:57:47,028 --> 00:57:49,228
<font color=#FFFF00>(Seong Joon)</font>

1075
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,768
<font color=#FFFF00>The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.</font>

1076
00:58:07,368 --> 00:58:08,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Are you surprised?</font>

1077
00:58:10,128 --> 00:58:11,168
<font color=#FFFF00>No.</font>

1078
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:13,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What brings you here?</font>

1079
00:58:15,198 --> 00:58:17,528
<font color=#FFFF00>The shareholders received the official document.</font>

1080
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,268
<font color=#FFFF00>The general meeting will be held soon.</font>

1081
00:58:19,468 --> 00:58:21,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, I know.</font>

1082
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:23,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Is everything ready?</font>

1083
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:27,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Yes, it's going accordingly.</font>

1084
00:58:28,228 --> 00:58:29,298
<font color=#FFFF00>By the way,</font>

1085
00:58:30,328 --> 00:58:31,928
<font color=#FFFF00>did you really prepare...</font>

1086
00:58:32,268 --> 00:58:34,598
<font color=#FFFF00>this big event by yourself?</font>

1087
00:58:35,698 --> 00:58:36,768
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1088
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,128
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1089
00:58:39,128 --> 00:58:40,468
<font color=#FFFF00>I am just proud of you. That's all.</font>

1090
00:58:40,628 --> 00:58:43,998
<font color=#FFFF00>I served Chairwoman Park for a long time,</font>

1091
00:58:44,498 --> 00:58:46,668
<font color=#FFFF00>but I never dared to do this.</font>

1092
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:50,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Of course, I didn't even know that she was alive.</font>

1093
00:58:51,198 --> 00:58:52,298
<font color=#FFFF00>There's nobody helping her.</font>

1094
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:54,598
<font color=#FFFF00>If there were people to help her,</font>

1095
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:57,468
<font color=#FFFF00>she wouldn't have been locked up for all those years.</font>

1096
00:58:57,698 --> 00:58:58,698
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1097
00:58:58,928 --> 00:58:59,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Right.</font>

1098
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:01,898
<font color=#FFFF00>You're right. Of course.</font>

1099
00:59:25,098 --> 00:59:26,828
<font color=#FFFF00>(Bang Hyun Jeong file)</font>

1100
00:59:26,898 --> 00:59:29,898
<font color=#FFFF00>(Copying 22 items)</font>

1101
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:47,598
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

1102
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:48,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon,</font>

1103
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:50,528
<font color=#FFFF00>I'm giving this to you just in case.</font>

1104
00:59:51,198 --> 00:59:54,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You will need this if something happens to me.</font>

1105
00:59:54,928 --> 00:59:57,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What do you mean? What would happen to you?</font>

1106
00:59:58,198 --> 00:59:59,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Is something wrong?</font>

1107
01:00:00,468 --> 01:00:01,468
<font color=#FFFF00>What's this?</font>

1108
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,628
<font color=#FFFF00>It's a news material.</font>

1109
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:05,628
<font color=#FFFF00>- News material? - Yes.</font>

1110
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,768
<font color=#FFFF00>You have many journalist friends.</font>

1111
01:00:09,198 --> 01:00:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>That's why I am giving it to you.</font>

1112
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:13,568
<font color=#FFFF00>What's the point of giving it to me?</font>

1113
01:00:14,098 --> 01:00:17,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You should give it to your brother. He's the head of Jinsung Daily News.</font>

1114
01:00:17,468 --> 01:00:18,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Still.</font>

1115
01:00:20,228 --> 01:00:21,398
<font color=#FFFF00>Why you...</font>

1116
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:23,528
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you up to these days?</font>

1117
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:26,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Tell me honestly.</font>

1118
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:27,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

1119
01:00:29,328 --> 01:00:31,068
<font color=#FFFF00>What are you two doing?</font>

1120
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:32,798
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

1121
01:00:32,968 --> 01:00:34,668
<font color=#FFFF00>The breakfast is ready.</font>

1122
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:37,768
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll go to work now.</font>

1123
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:40,268
<font color=#FFFF00>- Okay. - Seong Joon.</font>

1124
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:42,798
<font color=#FFFF00>Have a good day.</font>

1125
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:43,828
<font color=#FFFF00>Wait.</font>

1126
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:48,228
<font color=#FFFF00>What's that?</font>

1127
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:50,098
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

1128
01:00:50,598 --> 01:00:54,198
<font color=#FFFF00>Aren't you a little old to ask Seong Joon for this?</font>

1129
01:00:54,228 --> 01:00:56,028
<font color=#FFFF00>You are unbelievable.</font>

1130
01:00:56,328 --> 01:00:58,468
<font color=#FFFF00>You don't know anything.</font>

1131
01:00:58,698 --> 01:00:59,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Joon!</font>

1132
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:00,898
<font color=#FFFF00>Seong Hoon.</font>

1133
01:01:01,528 --> 01:01:03,668
<font color=#FFFF00>Why don't you...</font>

1134
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:06,768
<font color=#FFFF00>share it with me?</font>

1135
01:01:07,028 --> 01:01:09,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning. Good morning.</font>

1136
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:10,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning.</font>

1137
01:01:10,698 --> 01:01:11,998
<font color=#FFFF00>Good morning.</font>

1138
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:13,828
<font color=#FFFF00>You're early, Dong Hui.</font>

1139
01:01:13,828 --> 01:01:15,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. Seeing Dong Hui writing...</font>

1140
01:01:15,928 --> 01:01:18,898
<font color=#FFFF00>in this early morning...</font>

1141
01:01:18,998 --> 01:01:22,828
<font color=#FFFF00>makes me feel so relieved.</font>

1142
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:26,698
<font color=#FFFF00>- Right? - I know. Gosh.</font>

1143
01:01:27,128 --> 01:01:28,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Please write the episodes 9 and 10 well.</font>

1144
01:01:28,698 --> 01:01:30,128
<font color=#FFFF00>All right.</font>

1145
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,498
<font color=#FFFF00>Resign after writing episodes 9 and 10.</font>

1146
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:35,528
<font color=#FFFF00>- Stop it. - Stop it, sir.</font>

1147
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,298
<font color=#FFFF00>You're checking the stocks again.</font>

1148
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Will you turn off the computer?</font>

1149
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:45,428
<font color=#FFFF00>Who are you here for?</font>

1150
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:47,698
<font color=#FFFF00>Where is Mr. Han Seong Joon?</font>

1151
01:01:57,698 --> 01:01:59,328
<font color=#FFFF00>Okay.</font>

1152
01:01:59,868 --> 01:02:01,928
<font color=#FFFF00>Good job. Right.</font>

1153
01:02:04,698 --> 01:02:08,268
<font color=#FFFF00>Finally, Seong Joon is...</font>

1154
01:02:09,168 --> 01:02:10,468
<font color=#FFFF00>done for.</font>

1155
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:16,368
<font color=#FFFF00>Why are you looking for our director?</font>

1156
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:23,868
<font color=#FFFF00>What is it?</font>

1157
01:02:24,668 --> 01:02:26,528
<font color=#FFFF00>We are from the financial crime unit.</font>

1158
01:02:27,398 --> 01:02:28,428
<font color=#FFFF00>What?</font>

1159
01:02:31,368 --> 01:02:34,328
<font color=#FFFF00>We will search you for manipulating the stock price.</font>

1160
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:02,598
<font color=#FFFF00>(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

1161
01:03:02,998 --> 01:03:05,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I think I need to find what's mine.</font>

1162
01:03:05,368 --> 01:03:08,298
<font color=#FFFF00>A girl who has nothing like you can't do anything.</font>

1163
01:03:08,398 --> 01:03:09,828
<font color=#FFFF00>What did you say?</font>

1164
01:03:09,898 --> 01:03:11,368
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll put an end to this.</font>

1165
01:03:11,398 --> 01:03:14,068
<font color=#FFFF00>Goodness. What's going on?</font>

1166
01:03:14,428 --> 01:03:17,328
<font color=#FFFF00>I'll kill you all. How dare you scam me?</font>

1167
01:03:19,628 --> 01:03:22,298
<font color=#FFFF00>Dong Hui, come here.</font>

1168
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:25,098
<font color=#FFFF00>I am sorry. I'm really sorry.</font>

1169
01:03:25,368 --> 01:03:26,628
<font color=#FFFF00>Did you miss me a lot?</font>
