00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,941
<font color="yellow">What should we eat for dinner?</font>

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,515
<font color="yellow">The housekeeper is off today.</font>

4
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:22,515
<font color="yellow">We have some octopus stir-fry left. Let's make a fried rice with it.</font>

5
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:24,145
<font color="yellow">We have octopus stir-fry?</font>

6
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:27,345
<font color="yellow">Yes, Hee Sook made it yesterday for lunch.</font>

7
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:28,715
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

8
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:31,575
<font color="yellow">She's quite friendly, isn't she?</font>

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,475
<font color="yellow">- I don't know if she really is. - Please come inside.</font>

10
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:37,915
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

11
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:39,775
<font color="yellow">What an unexpected pleasure.</font>

12
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:41,345
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

13
00:00:42,745 --> 00:00:44,545
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,645
<font color="yellow">You don't have to take a bow to me.</font>

15
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,575
<font color="yellow">I should have visited you earlier, but I'm sorry I was too busy.</font>

16
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:01,615
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd be appropriate to visit you properly,</font>

17
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:04,245
<font color="yellow">and that's why I am here.</font>

18
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,175
<font color="yellow">Ma'am, I hope we can get along well.</font>

19
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,945
<font color="yellow">You're such a polite person.</font>

20
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,415
<font color="yellow">Dear me.</font>

21
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,485
<font color="yellow">You're not just handsome, but very special as well.</font>

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,375
<font color="yellow">Jeong Ae,</font>

23
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,745
<font color="yellow">there was no point in expecting Song Joong Ki to move to our town...</font>

24
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:22,715
<font color="yellow">as we have such a handsome, cool,</font>

25
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,545
<font color="yellow">and polite gentleman here right now.</font>

26
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,215
<font color="yellow">Mother.</font>

27
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:28,075
<font color="yellow">It's really nice to have you.</font>

28
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,015
<font color="yellow">We also planned...</font>

29
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:32,645
<font color="yellow">to properly introduce ourselves to you...</font>

30
00:01:32,645 --> 00:01:34,215
<font color="yellow">in the near future.</font>

31
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,715
<font color="yellow">Thank you for welcoming me.</font>

32
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:41,175
<font color="yellow">I must be really lucky to have such nice neighbors.</font>

33
00:01:41,815 --> 00:01:44,245
<font color="yellow">It's pretty hard to have good neighbors.</font>

34
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,675
<font color="yellow">Indeed, that's so true.</font>

35
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:52,845
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I think I've made a mistake to you.</font>

36
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:55,775
<font color="yellow">A mistake?</font>

37
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,515
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Jeong Eun did?</font>

38
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,415
<font color="yellow">Is that really true?</font>

39
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:04,545
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

40
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:07,445
<font color="yellow">I was very bewildered and startled,</font>

41
00:02:07,445 --> 00:02:09,745
<font color="yellow">so I just reported her to the police right away...</font>

42
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,675
<font color="yellow">without asking her what happened.</font>

43
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,575
<font color="yellow">I realized that she's your nephew...</font>

44
00:02:13,575 --> 00:02:15,445
<font color="yellow">after I called the police.</font>

45
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:19,245
<font color="yellow">Why on earth did she break in his house?</font>

46
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:23,615
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's why she hasn't been home that day.</font>

47
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,015
<font color="yellow">She ended up in the police station again.</font>

48
00:02:27,275 --> 00:02:30,045
<font color="yellow">Why did she enter the house where a man lives alone?</font>

49
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:31,915
<font color="yellow">She must have gone out of mind.</font>

50
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:34,475
<font color="yellow">It's so shameful.</font>

51
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:38,615
<font color="yellow">So is Jeong Eun still in the station now?</font>

52
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:42,145
<font color="yellow">I called the police right away to release her.</font>

53
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:46,045
<font color="yellow">They said her mother came and took her.</font>

54
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,045
<font color="yellow">Then, she'll be fine.</font>

55
00:02:48,445 --> 00:02:51,845
<font color="yellow">Ae Ri must feel really terrible because of Jeong Eun.</font>

56
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:54,215
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

57
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,275
<font color="yellow">I should have handled it myself.</font>

58
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,145
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry about it.</font>

59
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:01,975
<font color="yellow">She thinks of the police station as her another home.</font>

60
00:03:01,975 --> 00:03:03,115
<font color="yellow">So don't mind it.</font>

61
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,275
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you were startled a lot...</font>

62
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,445
<font color="yellow">because of Jeong Eun. Why don't you have dinner with us?</font>

63
00:03:08,845 --> 00:03:10,075
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Ma'am.</font>

64
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:12,545
<font color="yellow">Come on. Let's have dinner together.</font>

65
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:15,575
<font color="yellow">I can't let a guest leave without serving dinner.</font>

66
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:21,675
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Mother.</font>

67
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:25,075
<font color="yellow">Don't you remember we were going to eat the leftover octopus?</font>

68
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:27,845
<font color="yellow">We can't serve leftovers to him.</font>

69
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:30,475
<font color="yellow">Take out all the meat we have in the fridge.</font>

70
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:32,715
<font color="yellow">Goodness, why do you make things so complicated?</font>

71
00:03:33,115 --> 00:03:35,945
<font color="yellow">The interior is very simple but it's cozy.</font>

72
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,015
<font color="yellow">I'm sure you took a lot of care.</font>

73
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,475
<font color="yellow">Do you really think so?</font>

74
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:44,545
<font color="yellow">We have lived in this house for over 30 years...</font>

75
00:03:44,545 --> 00:03:47,545
<font color="yellow">since our kids were this small.</font>

76
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:51,245
<font color="yellow">So many things had been broken...</font>

77
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,275
<font color="yellow">and worn as well.</font>

78
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:57,215
<font color="yellow">So we had repaired the broken parts and remodeled the house.</font>

79
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:00,245
<font color="yellow">- Sir, - Yes?</font>

80
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:01,875
<font color="yellow">please speak to me casually.</font>

81
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:04,045
<font color="yellow">I find this way more comfortable.</font>

82
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,745
<font color="yellow">I'm not really used to talking without using the honorifics.</font>

83
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,445
<font color="yellow">I couldn't talk down to privates when I was on active service.</font>

84
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:14,875
<font color="yellow">Where are you parents?</font>

85
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,045
<font color="yellow">Both of my parents passed away.</font>

86
00:04:20,075 --> 00:04:22,215
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

87
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:23,375
<font color="yellow">Do you have any siblings?</font>

88
00:04:23,715 --> 00:04:25,275
<font color="yellow">I have a younger brother.</font>

89
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:26,775
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

90
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:31,815
<font color="yellow">You two must be really close to each other, then.</font>

91
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:35,145
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

92
00:04:35,145 --> 00:04:36,975
<font color="yellow">please come have dinner.</font>

93
00:04:37,715 --> 00:04:39,745
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Let's go.</font>

94
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:46,145
<font color="yellow">I guess I bothered you too much.</font>

95
00:04:46,315 --> 00:04:47,375
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

96
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:49,745
<font color="yellow">Please don't be. We just made...</font>

97
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,015
<font color="yellow">bulgogi and japchae.</font>

98
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,515
<font color="yellow">Of course, we must treat you to a nice meal.</font>

99
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,845
<font color="yellow">We might have to see each other for decades.</font>

100
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,075
<font color="yellow">Please have a seat.</font>

101
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:00,945
<font color="yellow">You're right, Mom.</font>

102
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,015
<font color="yellow">Please sit here.</font>

103
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,415
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much.</font>

104
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:07,075
<font color="yellow">- You're welcome. - Please enjoy.</font>

105
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:10,185
<font color="yellow">- Let's take seats. - Okay.</font>

106
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,715
<font color="yellow">You really eat well.</font>

107
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,245
<font color="yellow">What type of girl do you like?</font>

108
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:26,515
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Mother,</font>

109
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,075
<font color="yellow">he's in the middle of eating.</font>

110
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:30,915
<font color="yellow">May I tell you after I finish dinner?</font>

111
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,675
<font color="yellow">Okay. Just don't forget to answer it, okay?</font>

112
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:36,745
<font color="yellow">- I won't. - My goodness.</font>

113
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:39,815
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - Mom.</font>

114
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,245
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

115
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,575
<font color="yellow">Why... Why are you here?</font>

116
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,575
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you had a visitor.</font>

117
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,315
<font color="yellow">He lives in the house across the street. Say hello.</font>

118
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,545
<font color="yellow">You have met him before.</font>

119
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,745
<font color="yellow">I have. It's good to see you.</font>

120
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:57,675
<font color="yellow">It's nice to meet you.</font>

121
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,915
<font color="yellow">Please sit down.</font>

122
00:05:59,915 --> 00:06:00,975
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

123
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,015
<font color="yellow">Join us for dinner if you haven't had yet.</font>

124
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,515
<font color="yellow">It's okay, Dad. I'll eat with Ah In.</font>

125
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,975
<font color="yellow">Will Hye Joo come home late tonight?</font>

126
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,775
<font color="yellow">- I think so. - Why?</font>

127
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:16,775
<font color="yellow">- Why? - Speaking of dinner,</font>

128
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,175
<font color="yellow">please let me take two eggs.</font>

129
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:22,345
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

130
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:29,245
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

131
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,615
<font color="yellow">Please enjoy your dinner.</font>

132
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:31,645
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

133
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:45,345
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I never though they would be with a visitor.</font>

134
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:07,445
<font color="yellow">I need to talk to you.</font>

135
00:07:12,845 --> 00:07:14,045
<font color="yellow">What happened?</font>

136
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,475
<font color="yellow">- What do you mean? - Do you have to ask?</font>

137
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:22,775
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim told me to work for the company at least to pay the debt.</font>

138
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:26,645
<font color="yellow">But still, how can you make such decision without me?</font>

139
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:31,045
<font color="yellow">It doesn't matter. It's between me and the company, not you.</font>

140
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,075
<font color="yellow">I calculated and since my salary is 1,000 dollars,</font>

141
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:39,515
<font color="yellow">it will take me 16 years and 8 months.</font>

142
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:42,775
<font color="yellow">Of course, it can be quicker if I get a raise.</font>

143
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,075
<font color="yellow">You think you have that much time on your hand?</font>

144
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:47,915
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

145
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,845
<font color="yellow">Are you saying that what I'm doing is...</font>

146
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:54,475
<font color="yellow">- a waste of my time? - I...</font>

147
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,315
<font color="yellow">didn't say it that harshly.</font>

148
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:04,045
<font color="yellow">I mean you shouldn't have signed a contract like that.</font>

149
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,645
<font color="yellow">Don't you know consequences of such contracts?</font>

150
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:09,675
<font color="yellow">What choice did I have? He was about to visit my grandmother.</font>

151
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,815
<font color="yellow">Besides, it doesn't matter how long it takes. I have to pay it back.</font>

152
00:08:14,575 --> 00:08:18,515
<font color="yellow">Also, I have a job which is hard to find nowadays...</font>

153
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:22,045
<font color="yellow">although my salary will be distrained.</font>

154
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:25,415
<font color="yellow">It's good that I can pay my brother's debt back.</font>

155
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,615
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I have a plan.</font>

156
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:32,015
<font color="yellow">- What plan? - I have one.</font>

157
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:34,115
<font color="yellow">In fact, I can't tell you right now.</font>

158
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:37,285
<font color="yellow">And don't worry. I'm going to...</font>

159
00:08:37,415 --> 00:08:41,015
<font color="yellow">make sure they don't find out we are in-laws.</font>

160
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:44,045
<font color="yellow">If they find out,</font>

161
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,215
<font color="yellow">I think the company might...</font>

162
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:49,815
<font color="yellow">shift the blame on you. They might think...</font>

163
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,815
<font color="yellow">you protected and helped me on purpose.</font>

164
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:55,015
<font color="yellow">I didn't really want to work at the same company, though.</font>

165
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:59,345
<font color="yellow">But this was the only way. I'm sorry.</font>

166
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,375
<font color="yellow">So I'm going to do everything in my power...</font>

167
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:06,475
<font color="yellow">to keep our relationship a secret.</font>

168
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:13,215
<font color="yellow">You're unstoppable, Dong Hui.</font>

169
00:09:14,915 --> 00:09:17,845
<font color="yellow">To be honest, I'm happy to have a job.</font>

170
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,115
<font color="yellow">Why are you happy?</font>

171
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:24,145
<font color="yellow">How can you be happy when you have to pay the debt for 16 years?</font>

172
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:26,515
<font color="yellow">My part time jobs don't pay well, too.</font>

173
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,875
<font color="yellow">Besides, I'm glad I can earn my living...</font>

174
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:31,615
<font color="yellow">doing things I want to do.</font>

175
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,075
<font color="yellow">Things you want to do?</font>

176
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:37,075
<font color="yellow">By any chance,</font>

177
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:39,815
<font color="yellow">did you want to work at our company?</font>

178
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:44,715
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

179
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:46,445
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

180
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:50,785
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you now.</font>

181
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,245
<font color="yellow">- Come on, Ms. Oh. - Anyway, please do support me.</font>

182
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:58,845
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

183
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,375
<font color="yellow">I knew it since you got into a cab with me in Taiwan.</font>

184
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,475
<font color="yellow">How can a woman get into a taxi with a stranger?</font>

185
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:11,415
<font color="yellow">And you were chased by gangsters.</font>

186
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:14,715
<font color="yellow">- You even followed them. - Please stop talking.</font>

187
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,745
<font color="yellow">I give up now. Let's go home and eat.</font>

188
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,615
<font color="yellow">Are you hungry?</font>

189
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:25,115
<font color="yellow">Of course I am. It's dinner time. How can I not be?</font>

190
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:29,715
<font color="yellow">I didn't even have my lunch because I was so shocked.</font>

191
00:10:30,175 --> 00:10:31,945
<font color="yellow">Don't blame it on me.</font>

192
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,375
<font color="yellow">Look at you, talking back to your boss.</font>

193
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:38,045
<font color="yellow">I knew you were going to be bossy.</font>

194
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,415
<font color="yellow">- Excuse me. - What is it now?</font>

195
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:44,615
<font color="yellow">You can go first.</font>

196
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,745
<font color="yellow">Why? Are you not going home?</font>

197
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,845
<font color="yellow">I need to stop by somewhere.</font>

198
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:52,075
<font color="yellow">Where?</font>

199
00:10:52,775 --> 00:10:53,815
<font color="yellow">I can't tell you.</font>

200
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:57,375
<font color="yellow">Director Han, please get home safe.</font>

201
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,175
<font color="yellow">I'll see you tomorrow at work.</font>

202
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:00,845
<font color="yellow">Goodbye.</font>

203
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,275
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Ms. Oh.</font>

204
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,015
<font color="yellow">I think I need to change the pipe.</font>

205
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,815
<font color="yellow">Goodness, really?</font>

206
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:15,515
<font color="yellow">How can you let your guest work after dinner?</font>

207
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:18,215
<font color="yellow">Mother, he said we should change the pipe.</font>

208
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,645
<font color="yellow">I told him so many times to change it,</font>

209
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,375
<font color="yellow">but he never listened. Now look what happened.</font>

210
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:26,475
<font color="yellow">I know how to fit it. It was just not that bad to be changed.</font>

211
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:30,315
<font color="yellow">It wasn't a crucial problem back then.</font>

212
00:11:30,745 --> 00:11:34,945
<font color="yellow">How can you say it wasn't a crucial problem?</font>

213
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:38,415
<font color="yellow">Try to live in a house where there's a flood in it.</font>

214
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:42,545
<font color="yellow">Men in our family are useless.</font>

215
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:44,375
<font color="yellow">I agree with her.</font>

216
00:11:44,615 --> 00:11:47,875
<font color="yellow">- Mom, how can you be on her side? - Why can't I?</font>

217
00:11:50,145 --> 00:11:52,445
<font color="yellow">I taped it so that it wouldn't leak.</font>

218
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,515
<font color="yellow">I'll come back tomorrow and put in a new pipe.</font>

219
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:58,515
<font color="yellow">I told you. He's better than Song Joong Ki.</font>

220
00:11:58,515 --> 00:12:00,715
<font color="yellow">I really appreciate it.</font>

221
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:04,115
<font color="yellow">If I called a plumber, this would have cost a fortune.</font>

222
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,215
<font color="yellow">You served me a good dinner.</font>

223
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:14,745
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

224
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:17,945
<font color="yellow">Don't mention it. I had a great time.</font>

225
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,575
<font color="yellow">My wife made this kimchi. Try it at home.</font>

226
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,245
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - I'm not sure about other food,</font>

227
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,745
<font color="yellow">but she makes the best kimchi.</font>

228
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:30,945
<font color="yellow">It must go really well with ramyeon.</font>

229
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:34,975
<font color="yellow">Is that you, Seong Joon?</font>

230
00:12:36,915 --> 00:12:37,915
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

231
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,845
<font color="yellow">You haven't met him, right? He moved in across our house.</font>

232
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:49,015
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello. I'm Lee Hyun Woo.</font>

233
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:52,815
<font color="yellow">- I'm Han Seong Joon. - I see.</font>

234
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:58,175
<font color="yellow">Don't be strangers to each other.</font>

235
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,545
<font color="yellow">I'll get going then.</font>

236
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,115
<font color="yellow">- Okay. Goodbye and see you again. - Yes.</font>

237
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:08,815
<font color="yellow">- Did you have dinner? - No, not yet.</font>

238
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:10,515
<font color="yellow">Let's go in. I'll prepare your dinner.</font>

239
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:13,345
<font color="yellow">You don't have to. I'll prepare it myself.</font>

240
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,245
<font color="yellow">Your mom's angry.</font>

241
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,175
<font color="yellow">Because I didn't fix the leak.</font>

242
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,715
<font color="yellow">- Really? - She said we are useless.</font>

243
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:23,475
<font color="yellow">That was harsh. Let's go inside.</font>

244
00:13:23,575 --> 00:13:24,615
<font color="yellow">Let's get inside.</font>

245
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:27,245
<font color="yellow">Be careful.</font>

246
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,715
<font color="yellow">How are you, Moong Chi?</font>

247
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:43,475
<font color="yellow">You want your treats more than me, don't you?</font>

248
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:52,515
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui...</font>

249
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
<font color="yellow">isn't here.</font>

250
00:13:57,915 --> 00:13:59,445
<font color="yellow">I don't know where she went.</font>

251
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,775
<font color="yellow">(I made a promise and I intend to keep it.)</font>

252
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,715
<font color="yellow">Yes, president.</font>

253
00:14:54,815 --> 00:14:58,815
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, aren't you going to eat your dinner? We must go for a walk.</font>

254
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:02,475
<font color="yellow">Let's try to look for your eyes.</font>

255
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:07,575
<font color="yellow">There's something strange about their youngest son.</font>

256
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,975
<font color="yellow">I don't remember them having the youngest son. Look into it.</font>

257
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,545
<font color="yellow">Yes, Sir.</font>

258
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,775
<font color="yellow">It's a square of s.</font>

259
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:44,275
<font color="yellow">Let's see. It's ax plus two squares.</font>

260
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,845
<font color="yellow">And it's multiplied by two and take a half of it later. Then k equals...</font>

261
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:49,475
<font color="yellow">three.</font>

262
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:53,275
<font color="yellow">How can he not correct such an easy question?</font>

263
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:56,345
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this.</font>

264
00:15:56,675 --> 00:15:57,715
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

265
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:01,975
<font color="yellow">This is delicious.</font>

266
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:04,215
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - What do you want?</font>

267
00:16:05,545 --> 00:16:08,645
<font color="yellow">- Where are you? - I'm having dinner.</font>

268
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:11,775
<font color="yellow">Are you still eating dinner? It's 11pm.</font>

269
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:13,745
<font color="yellow">Why are you so grumpy?</font>

270
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:16,775
<font color="yellow">You should come home early.</font>

271
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:19,315
<font color="yellow">- How can I raise our son by myself? - What are you talking about?</font>

272
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:23,315
<font color="yellow">You raised him all on your own so far.</font>

273
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,375
<font color="yellow">Then, do you expect me to take care of your parents by myself?</font>

274
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:29,375
<font color="yellow">It's all on you. You were the one who said...</font>

275
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,845
<font color="yellow">you would take good care of my parents.</font>

276
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:34,015
<font color="yellow">- Are you kidding me? - Is it...</font>

277
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:37,745
<font color="yellow">Is it because Ji Hoon's grade went down?</font>

278
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:40,015
<font color="yellow">Forget it. When are you coming home?</font>

279
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:43,545
<font color="yellow">Okay, fine. I'll be home soon.</font>

280
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:45,215
<font color="yellow">When?</font>

281
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:47,845
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

282
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:50,945
<font color="yellow">Hello? Honey? Honey?</font>

283
00:16:58,575 --> 00:17:00,245
<font color="yellow">My husband is no better than my son.</font>

284
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,215
<font color="yellow">I get a lot of phone calls. I apologize.</font>

285
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:11,715
<font color="yellow">It's from your wife, isn't it?</font>

286
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,275
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

287
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:17,985
<font color="yellow">No way, it is not.</font>

288
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,815
<font color="yellow">That was a funny joke, Ms. Jang.</font>

289
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:27,675
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Didn't your wife nag at you to come home early?</font>

290
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:33,245
<font color="yellow">I said that's not true. She never nags me.</font>

291
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:36,245
<font color="yellow">Are you married?</font>

292
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:39,145
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I never knew you are.</font>

293
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:41,415
<font color="yellow">I thought you got divorced.</font>

294
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:42,815
<font color="yellow">Divorced?</font>

295
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:45,775
<font color="yellow">Did you think I was single?</font>

296
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,115
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

297
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,175
<font color="yellow">Then, let's make...</font>

298
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:51,745
<font color="yellow">a toast.</font>

299
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:54,485
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

300
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,015
<font color="yellow">Thank you. I enjoyed it a lot.</font>

301
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,015
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

302
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:05,745
<font color="yellow">It's my pleasure.</font>

303
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:15,915
<font color="yellow">I'd like to pay by three-month installment.</font>

304
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,415
<font color="yellow">- Sorry? - Three-month installment.</font>

305
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:22,415
<font color="yellow">I said three months.</font>

306
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:24,915
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

307
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,075
<font color="yellow">Yoo Ra, how will you go home?</font>

308
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:29,415
<font color="yellow">Someone will pick me up.</font>

309
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:31,145
<font color="yellow">- See you, then. - Take care.</font>

310
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,345
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Bye.</font>

311
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:57,345
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang. Ms. Jang! Wait a minute!</font>

312
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:00,245
<font color="yellow">Gosh, Yoo Ra!</font>

313
00:19:00,715 --> 00:19:04,215
<font color="yellow">Hey! Where are you going?</font>

314
00:19:10,145 --> 00:19:11,145
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

315
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:21,345
<font color="yellow">What is it this time?</font>

316
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,615
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

317
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:25,015
<font color="yellow">Do you really don't know?</font>

318
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,675
<font color="yellow">I can't believe you got the wrong answer to this question.</font>

319
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,275
<font color="yellow">You solved this so many times!</font>

320
00:19:31,445 --> 00:19:32,545
<font color="yellow">Look at this.</font>

321
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:35,245
<font color="yellow">In this A coordination, X2 is...</font>

322
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:37,275
<font color="yellow">2A, 4A square.</font>

323
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:39,615
<font color="yellow">If you draw a line from this point,</font>

324
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,215
<font color="yellow">you can get the height and the width.</font>

325
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,545
<font color="yellow">Then, what's X?</font>

326
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,485
<font color="yellow">It's the cube of 6A.</font>

327
00:19:44,515 --> 00:19:45,745
<font color="yellow">Then, what's K?</font>

328
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:48,345
<font color="yellow">It's three!</font>

329
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:51,115
<font color="yellow">Why did you miss this easy question?</font>

330
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,945
<font color="yellow">You missed this question and fell to the third rank!</font>

331
00:19:56,815 --> 00:19:58,915
<font color="yellow">Are you out of mind? Are you?</font>

332
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,315
<font color="yellow">Those who solve math questions like a calculator...</font>

333
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,445
<font color="yellow">hardly make it to the gifted high school.</font>

334
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:08,075
<font color="yellow">How could you get this wrong? You've solved it so many times.</font>

335
00:20:08,175 --> 00:20:12,075
<font color="yellow">They just changed few numbers. How on earth could you get it wrong?</font>

336
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:17,375
<font color="yellow">What's gotten in your head?</font>

337
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:20,915
<font color="yellow">I can't do this any more.</font>

338
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,115
<font color="yellow">Say that again.</font>

339
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:26,545
<font color="yellow">I said I can't do this any more.</font>

340
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:29,815
<font color="yellow">I ran into a wall I can't cross. I'm really at the end of my rope!</font>

341
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,145
<font color="yellow">I no longer want to study!</font>

342
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,145
<font color="yellow">I've done everything as you said.</font>

343
00:20:39,075 --> 00:20:42,145
<font color="yellow">But I cannot do this any more!</font>

344
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,275
<font color="yellow">What... What?</font>

345
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:48,775
<font color="yellow">Have you lost your mind?</font>

346
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,985
<font color="yellow">How dare you yell at me?</font>

347
00:20:51,745 --> 00:20:53,575
<font color="yellow">Did you just fly in the teeth of me?</font>

348
00:21:00,615 --> 00:21:02,615
<font color="yellow">We need to talk more at home. Get in the car.</font>

349
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,715
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, where are you going? Stop right there.</font>

350
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,875
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

351
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:28,845
<font color="yellow">The number you have dialed is not available at this moment.</font>

352
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,275
<font color="yellow">There will be charges after the beep.</font>

353
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,575
<font color="yellow">So you had me...</font>

354
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,845
<font color="yellow">treat you and your friends to dinner and now you ignore my calls.</font>

355
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:43,915
<font color="yellow">What a foxy wench.</font>

356
00:21:45,115 --> 00:21:46,985
<font color="yellow">- Uncle! - Gosh.</font>

357
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:53,375
<font color="yellow">Is Yoo Ra not answering your calls again?</font>

358
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,845
<font color="yellow">You scared me again.</font>

359
00:21:57,175 --> 00:21:58,245
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

360
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:02,415
<font color="yellow">Since when have you been here?</font>

361
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:04,115
<font color="yellow">Am I invisible to you?</font>

362
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,075
<font color="yellow">Yes, you're invisible.</font>

363
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:08,475
<font color="yellow">It's because you're too small, okay?</font>

364
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,215
<font color="yellow">- You little... - Are you going to knuckle me?</font>

365
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:13,145
<font color="yellow">No, I won't.</font>

366
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:14,975
<font color="yellow">Please flush the toilet.</font>

367
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:17,045
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

368
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:25,075
<font color="yellow">I'm asking what you will do.</font>

369
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,315
<font color="yellow">I said okay.</font>

370
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,215
<font color="yellow">Please don't say just okay.</font>

371
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:35,945
<font color="yellow">We must pay the rent to Mother. It's the 30th of this month already.</font>

372
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:36,975
<font color="yellow">How will you pay her?</font>

373
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,515
<font color="yellow">I said I'll take care of it.</font>

374
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:41,615
<font color="yellow">Now, it's not my business any more.</font>

375
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,215
<font color="yellow">Make sure to take care of it yourself, okay?</font>

376
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:47,415
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please leave now.</font>

377
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:48,815
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

378
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,315
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, what are you doing?</font>

379
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:59,015
<font color="yellow">Uncle, I'm making ramyeon.</font>

380
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:00,645
<font color="yellow">Where's Hee Sook?</font>

381
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,045
<font color="yellow">I think she's ill.</font>

382
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,245
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

383
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,375
<font color="yellow">This is unbelievable.</font>

384
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:09,215
<font color="yellow">Ah In, come take a seat. I'll make you breakfast.</font>

385
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:16,775
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, come out and have breakfast!</font>

386
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,345
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with you? You must make Ji Hoon breakfast.</font>

387
00:23:24,345 --> 00:23:25,945
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo is making ramyeon for him.</font>

388
00:23:28,275 --> 00:23:29,445
<font color="yellow">Honey!</font>

389
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,875
<font color="yellow">I don't care what he has for breakfast.</font>

390
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,115
<font color="yellow">You're such an unbelievable woman.</font>

391
00:23:37,545 --> 00:23:40,315
<font color="yellow">You were obsessed with organic and nutritious food before...</font>

392
00:23:40,345 --> 00:23:42,945
<font color="yellow">and made him a sumptuous feast every morning.</font>

393
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:46,675
<font color="yellow">How can you neglect him just because his grades went down?</font>

394
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:54,045
<font color="yellow">This is really horrible.</font>

395
00:23:55,315 --> 00:23:58,515
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, have breakfast before you leave. Hey.</font>

396
00:24:02,115 --> 00:24:03,275
<font color="yellow">Seriously.</font>

397
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,375
<font color="yellow">I'm sick of both of you.</font>

398
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:09,175
<font color="yellow">- Is Aunt okay? - I don't know.</font>

399
00:24:09,445 --> 00:24:11,945
<font color="yellow">- She went on a strike. - A strike?</font>

400
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:14,875
<font color="yellow">Then, come have some ramyeon.</font>

401
00:24:16,045 --> 00:24:17,415
<font color="yellow">This is awful.</font>

402
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:20,215
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, you must eat now.</font>

403
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:21,415
<font color="yellow">You have to go to school.</font>

404
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:23,175
<font color="yellow">Right. I will.</font>

405
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:27,545
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

406
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,015
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo, it's very tasty.</font>

407
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:40,745
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

408
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,475
<font color="yellow">What's going on here?</font>

409
00:24:45,115 --> 00:24:47,045
<font color="yellow">Did you have my son cook ramyeon for you?</font>

410
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:51,315
<font color="yellow">I didn't! He just made it for himself.</font>

411
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:52,845
<font color="yellow">You just made a wrong guess.</font>

412
00:24:52,845 --> 00:24:55,215
<font color="yellow">He's right. I made it because I wanted to eat this.</font>

413
00:24:55,545 --> 00:24:56,815
<font color="yellow">Where's Hee Sook?</font>

414
00:24:58,145 --> 00:25:00,145
<font color="yellow">She's on a strike today.</font>

415
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:01,345
<font color="yellow">A strike?</font>

416
00:25:08,015 --> 00:25:09,815
<font color="yellow">Hey, Hee Sook.</font>

417
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,545
<font color="yellow">I really don't understand you.</font>

418
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,975
<font color="yellow">How can you make your son leave with an empty stomach...</font>

419
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:17,115
<font color="yellow">just because his grades dropped a little?</font>

420
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:19,745
<font color="yellow">It's none of your business.</font>

421
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:22,815
<font color="yellow">He ranked the third in the entire Seoul,</font>

422
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:25,115
<font color="yellow">and that's really amazing.</font>

423
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,175
<font color="yellow">Maybe,</font>

424
00:25:26,575 --> 00:25:28,375
<font color="yellow">it's amazing only to you.</font>

425
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:29,915
<font color="yellow">Wouldn't you even find it amazing...</font>

426
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:32,845
<font color="yellow">if Chang Soo's grades rank higher than the 30th?</font>

427
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:34,615
<font color="yellow">- What? - And...</font>

428
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:38,845
<font color="yellow">why did you tell him that I graduated from a local college?</font>

429
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:44,245
<font color="yellow">He doesn't listen to me since that day.</font>

430
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:48,045
<font color="yellow">Hey, I'm sure that's not the reason.</font>

431
00:25:48,545 --> 00:25:51,675
<font color="yellow">And Chang Soo is responsible for all this.</font>

432
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,475
<font color="yellow">Why do you blame him out of the blue?</font>

433
00:25:55,615 --> 00:25:58,115
<font color="yellow">It's because Ji Hoon lives in the same house with Chang Soo.</font>

434
00:25:58,415 --> 00:26:00,975
<font color="yellow">All Chang Soo does is playing and eating all day long!</font>

435
00:26:01,145 --> 00:26:03,845
<font color="yellow">That made Ji Hoon become lazy,</font>

436
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,615
<font color="yellow">and look what happened now!</font>

437
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:07,315
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo,</font>

438
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:09,915
<font color="yellow">do you really have to live with us?</font>

439
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:12,775
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

440
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:21,745
<font color="yellow">Are you going out today?</font>

441
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:25,245
<font color="yellow">You had a haircut yesterday and you're dressed up nicely.</font>

442
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,875
<font color="yellow">Grandma, I got a job.</font>

443
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:29,475
<font color="yellow">You got a job?</font>

444
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,275
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

445
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:32,545
<font color="yellow">Where do you work, then?</font>

446
00:26:33,045 --> 00:26:35,345
<font color="yellow">I'll tell you later.</font>

447
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,775
<font color="yellow">I'll make a lot of money...</font>

448
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:41,315
<font color="yellow">and let you live in the lap of luxury.</font>

449
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,175
<font color="yellow">Please wait a little longer, okay?</font>

450
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:23,615
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

451
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:43,745
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

452
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:44,915
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

453
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:46,445
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

454
00:28:46,775 --> 00:28:48,415
<font color="yellow">- Hello, Director Han. - Hello.</font>

455
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,815
<font color="yellow">Hello, Director Han!</font>

456
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:54,845
<font color="yellow">The door's closing.</font>

457
00:28:56,345 --> 00:28:58,175
<font color="yellow">Yes, hello.</font>

458
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:09,675
<font color="yellow">- Hello. - Hello.</font>

459
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:11,945
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

460
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:14,475
<font color="yellow">Stop coming in. Take the next one.</font>

461
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:18,345
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

462
00:29:19,415 --> 00:29:20,575
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

463
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:58,875
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? We brought her here.</font>

464
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:02,745
<font color="yellow">That's not important. We requested for an intern.</font>

465
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:06,275
<font color="yellow">She's not an intern. We hired her as the assistant writer.</font>

466
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,775
<font color="yellow">Assistant writer? You always drain our funds.</font>

467
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:10,115
<font color="yellow">Are you going to increase payroll cost again?</font>

468
00:30:10,245 --> 00:30:12,675
<font color="yellow">We're the money-generating team. We should hire an assistant.</font>

469
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,915
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

470
00:30:16,175 --> 00:30:17,845
<font color="yellow">- It's nothing, sir. - It's nothing, sir.</font>

471
00:30:18,175 --> 00:30:20,675
<font color="yellow">We were having a debate.</font>

472
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,675
<font color="yellow">I will report it to you later.</font>

473
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:37,475
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim!</font>

474
00:30:37,475 --> 00:30:39,515
<font color="yellow">Don't you think...</font>

475
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,045
<font color="yellow">you're being unreasonable this time, Mr. Park?</font>

476
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,415
<font color="yellow">We're struggling here because we're short-staffed.</font>

477
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:47,345
<font color="yellow">And you're asking for a darn assistant. That's why we are upset!</font>

478
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,745
<font color="yellow">What? A darn assistant?</font>

479
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,645
<font color="yellow">- Hey, do you hear yourself? - Wait.</font>

480
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:58,615
<font color="yellow">I don't know exactly what is happening here,</font>

481
00:30:59,075 --> 00:31:02,375
<font color="yellow">but I will do everything. So please don't fight.</font>

482
00:31:04,115 --> 00:31:05,515
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Really?</font>

483
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:07,675
<font color="yellow">Everything?</font>

484
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:09,915
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

485
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:19,475
<font color="yellow">What's happened to my room?</font>

486
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:32,445
<font color="yellow">Mom!</font>

487
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:38,375
<font color="yellow">Mom, did you rent out my room?</font>

488
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:40,215
<font color="yellow">Yes, I did.</font>

489
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,975
<font color="yellow">A room was being wasted.</font>

490
00:31:42,675 --> 00:31:45,575
<font color="yellow">- Still, how can you do that? - How can you just...</font>

491
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:48,375
<font color="yellow">leave home without saying anything to your mom and...</font>

492
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:52,115
<font color="yellow">go out of reach for three years? Instead of waiting for...</font>

493
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,845
<font color="yellow">that ungrateful child, I chose to give the room to my student...</font>

494
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,475
<font color="yellow">who visits me all the time and takes care of me when I'm sick.</font>

495
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,415
<font color="yellow">So I decided to consider her as my daughter.</font>

496
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:02,545
<font color="yellow">Na Eun went to the U.S. for training. She'll be back soon.</font>

497
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,075
<font color="yellow">Then where will I stay?</font>

498
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,745
<font color="yellow">I hope you wouldn't stay at my place,</font>

499
00:32:08,945 --> 00:32:10,845
<font color="yellow">but we're still family.</font>

500
00:32:11,645 --> 00:32:13,745
<font color="yellow">So just stay wherever you want.</font>

501
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,475
<font color="yellow">- What? - Except for Na Eun's room.</font>

502
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:22,075
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui, these are supplex and polyester fabrics.</font>

503
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:24,375
<font color="yellow">Please match them with the fabric list and number them accordingly.</font>

504
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:26,745
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will.</font>

505
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:28,515
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

506
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,215
<font color="yellow">Please summarize these drama proposals as soon as possible.</font>

507
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,315
<font color="yellow">Write down each one's subject and concept clearly.</font>

508
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:35,545
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

509
00:32:35,545 --> 00:32:38,975
<font color="yellow">Also, please convert these scripts into pdf files, okay?</font>

510
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,775
<font color="yellow">Also, please classify these, too.</font>

511
00:32:41,775 --> 00:32:45,275
<font color="yellow">Divide them into mini-series, weekend drama and daily drama.</font>

512
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:46,875
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

513
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:51,245
<font color="yellow">Please take it to the Research and Development Team.</font>

514
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,475
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll be back.</font>

515
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:08,075
<font color="yellow">Where is the Research and Development Team's office?</font>

516
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:15,115
<font color="yellow">Please move the Research and Development Team's...</font>

517
00:33:15,175 --> 00:33:16,575
<font color="yellow">Friday presentation to Wednesday.</font>

518
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:19,115
<font color="yellow">Our competition might release their product at the same time.</font>

519
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:20,945
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'll move it.</font>

520
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:24,175
<font color="yellow">And please schedule a meeting with Chinese distributor.</font>

521
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:25,775
<font color="yellow">Okay, Director Bang.</font>

522
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:34,345
<font color="yellow">- Ms. Oh. - Yes?</font>

523
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:40,215
<font color="yellow">Can I talk to you?</font>

524
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:52,845
<font color="yellow">Producer Kim informed me yesterday.</font>

525
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:54,515
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

526
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,475
<font color="yellow">How's work so far?</font>

527
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:04,615
<font color="yellow">I still don't know a lot of things, but the work is fun.</font>

528
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,645
<font color="yellow">The work shouldn't be fun.</font>

529
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:11,745
<font color="yellow">The police is already searching for Seo Cheol Min.</font>

530
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:13,775
<font color="yellow">When he gets caught, he will receive a criminal punishment.</font>

531
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:16,575
<font color="yellow">He won't receive indulgence...</font>

532
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,115
<font color="yellow">just because you work here.</font>

533
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:23,145
<font color="yellow">I know that. He committed a crime, so he should get punished.</font>

534
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:25,885
<font color="yellow">I just know that...</font>

535
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:30,075
<font color="yellow">he can't pay the money back even if he gets caught.</font>

536
00:34:31,115 --> 00:34:34,745
<font color="yellow">I shouldn't be a nuisance to other people.</font>

537
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,545
<font color="yellow">You've already become a nuisance.</font>

538
00:34:36,945 --> 00:34:38,845
<font color="yellow">You incurred damage to our company...</font>

539
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:42,115
<font color="yellow">and you scarred our record.</font>

540
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,145
<font color="yellow">So you should stay low...</font>

541
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,885
<font color="yellow">as if you don't exist when you work here.</font>

542
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:52,845
<font color="yellow">Okay. I understand.</font>

543
00:34:54,015 --> 00:34:55,115
<font color="yellow">Director Bang.</font>

544
00:35:00,075 --> 00:35:01,745
<font color="yellow">Come in, Seong Joon.</font>

545
00:35:02,175 --> 00:35:04,645
<font color="yellow">- You can leave now. - Okay.</font>

546
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,245
<font color="yellow">I was going to go see you anyway.</font>

547
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,015
<font color="yellow">Let's eat lunch together.</font>

548
00:35:25,045 --> 00:35:26,175
<font color="yellow">I am sorry.</font>

549
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,115
<font color="yellow">Going up.</font>

550
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:41,275
<font color="yellow">What should we eat for lunch?</font>

551
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,885
<font color="yellow">Should we really go try that sundae soup?</font>

552
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:11,815
<font color="yellow">It's not as bad as I thought. It looks quite okay, too.</font>

553
00:36:15,275 --> 00:36:17,275
<font color="yellow">What are you thinking, Seong Joon?</font>

554
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,245
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

555
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:22,815
<font color="yellow">- Why? - I made an effort to come here.</font>

556
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,945
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you give me some credit for it?</font>

557
00:36:28,415 --> 00:36:30,215
<font color="yellow">Try it. It's quite tasty, too.</font>

558
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:35,385
<font color="yellow">- Is something bothering you? - No.</font>

559
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:37,475
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

560
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:51,385
<font color="yellow">You're not supposed to talk and think too much here.</font>

561
00:36:51,715 --> 00:36:53,175
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and eat your soup.</font>

562
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,845
<font color="yellow">I'll cut you slack since you're handsome.</font>

563
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,815
<font color="yellow">You better stay handsome.</font>

564
00:36:59,975 --> 00:37:01,575
<font color="yellow">Otherwise, I'll get upset.</font>

565
00:37:24,145 --> 00:37:27,475
<font color="yellow">Yes, this is Oh Dong Hui from Contents Marketing Team of FGC.</font>

566
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:32,615
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

567
00:37:33,175 --> 00:37:36,215
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park went out for lunch.</font>

568
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,715
<font color="yellow">So he's not available right now.</font>

569
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:53,345
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

570
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:17,885
<font color="yellow">- What? - How could you do that?</font>

571
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:20,275
<font color="yellow">How can you feed warm food to our family's enemy...</font>

572
00:38:20,275 --> 00:38:21,975
<font color="yellow">in a friendly vibe?</font>

573
00:38:21,975 --> 00:38:24,575
<font color="yellow">Family's enemy? That's nonsense.</font>

574
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:27,415
<font color="yellow">Our family's enemy is you. Do you know that?</font>

575
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:28,885
<font color="yellow">Why am I?</font>

576
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:32,315
<font color="yellow">Why would a grown-up woman break into a man's house?</font>

577
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:35,345
<font color="yellow">We are so embarrassed because of you.</font>

578
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,145
<font color="yellow">Did he even tell you that?</font>

579
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:38,815
<font color="yellow">Are you interested in him?</font>

580
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:41,045
<font color="yellow">Even if you were interested in him,</font>

581
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:43,045
<font color="yellow">you should just ask him to have a cup of tea.</font>

582
00:38:43,115 --> 00:38:46,475
<font color="yellow">How can you shamelessly barge into a man's house like that?</font>

583
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,515
<font color="yellow">You're dead, David!</font>

584
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:51,615
<font color="yellow">So,</font>

585
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:54,885
<font color="yellow">have you decided to live in your mother's house?</font>

586
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,045
<font color="yellow">Don't you see that I'm taking my stuff?</font>

587
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,415
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

588
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:05,945
<font color="yellow">We have to finish everything today. So get here by 3pm.</font>

589
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:07,745
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

590
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:14,475
<font color="yellow">How can you eat beef bulgogi...</font>

591
00:39:14,475 --> 00:39:16,415
<font color="yellow">after putting me in jail?</font>

592
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:17,885
<font color="yellow">That's not all you ate.</font>

593
00:39:17,885 --> 00:39:20,715
<font color="yellow">I heard you also ate marinated crab, kimchi, and...</font>

594
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,975
<font color="yellow">freshly cooked japchae. How could you enjoy them?</font>

595
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:28,385
<font color="yellow">Did you just laugh?</font>

596
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:30,275
<font color="yellow">Hey, David!</font>

597
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,275
<font color="yellow">Because of you, I had to...</font>

598
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:35,645
<font color="yellow">reunite with my mom in jail after not seeing her for three years.</font>

599
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:38,945
<font color="yellow">It's not like we don't know each other.</font>

600
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:41,475
<font color="yellow">We even met in New York.</font>

601
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:43,515
<font color="yellow">They say even brushing past a person is one's karma.</font>

602
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:46,415
<font color="yellow">How can you lock me up in jail just because I entered your house?</font>

603
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:49,145
<font color="yellow">Then you came to my house and had a nice meal.</font>

604
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:50,885
<font color="yellow">How can a person be like that?</font>

605
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:53,675
<font color="yellow">You weren't like this in New York.</font>

606
00:39:53,745 --> 00:39:55,215
<font color="yellow">What happened to you?</font>

607
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,575
<font color="yellow">Stop.</font>

608
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:58,275
<font color="yellow">Stop bringing that up.</font>

609
00:39:58,415 --> 00:39:59,575
<font color="yellow">What did I say?</font>

610
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:00,645
<font color="yellow">Stop talking about New York.</font>

611
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:03,675
<font color="yellow">I told you many times that I am not your acquaintance.</font>

612
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,815
<font color="yellow">That's why I put you in jail. Got it?</font>

613
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,915
<font color="yellow">If you got it, leave now. If you keep doing this,</font>

614
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12,015
<font color="yellow">I'm going to report you for interrupting my work.</font>

615
00:40:12,545 --> 00:40:13,945
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

616
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,775
<font color="yellow">- Is everything going well? - Yes, it is.</font>

617
00:40:15,775 --> 00:40:16,945
<font color="yellow">I'm not done yet.</font>

618
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:19,345
<font color="yellow">What now?</font>

619
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:25,075
<font color="yellow">Listen carefully.</font>

620
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,385
<font color="yellow">If I see you again,</font>

621
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,885
<font color="yellow">I am not a human.</font>

622
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:53,645
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

623
00:40:54,415 --> 00:40:55,645
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

624
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:57,845
<font color="yellow">I greeted you yesterday.</font>

625
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:00,545
<font color="yellow">Yes. Yes, you did.</font>

626
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,215
<font color="yellow">By the way, what brings you here?</font>

627
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:09,245
<font color="yellow">It's nothing. I was just passing by and I thought I'd take a look.</font>

628
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:11,075
<font color="yellow">I'll see you around, then.</font>

629
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:12,945
<font color="yellow">Bye.</font>

630
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:26,445
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

631
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:28,745
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

632
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:31,145
<font color="yellow">Did that helper quit?</font>

633
00:41:32,275 --> 00:41:33,845
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

634
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:35,515
<font color="yellow">It's two dollars.</font>

635
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:43,275
<font color="yellow">I don't know. it's hard to find a good person these days.</font>

636
00:41:44,515 --> 00:41:45,975
<font color="yellow">How much will you pay her in a month?</font>

637
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,775
<font color="yellow">I think you can find a good person with that money.</font>

638
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:53,415
<font color="yellow">Okay. I will ask my customers.</font>

639
00:41:55,075 --> 00:41:56,115
<font color="yellow">Excuse me.</font>

640
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:59,515
<font color="yellow">Is someone looking to hire helper?</font>

641
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:01,345
<font color="yellow">Why do you ask?</font>

642
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:05,275
<font color="yellow">If it's okay, I want to have an interview.</font>

643
00:42:05,885 --> 00:42:08,145
<font color="yellow">I live right across the street.</font>

644
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:10,015
<font color="yellow">I recently moved here.</font>

645
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:12,275
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

646
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:16,675
<font color="yellow">I think you can't do it at your age.</font>

647
00:42:17,545 --> 00:42:19,945
<font color="yellow">Women these days are very picky.</font>

648
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,915
<font color="yellow">Nobody would hire someone old.</font>

649
00:42:24,315 --> 00:42:26,945
<font color="yellow">Still, I beg you.</font>

650
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:30,845
<font color="yellow">I used to run a side dish store.</font>

651
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:32,915
<font color="yellow">I once ran a traditional wedding food store, too.</font>

652
00:42:33,515 --> 00:42:35,385
<font color="yellow">When I was younger,</font>

653
00:42:36,745 --> 00:42:38,315
<font color="yellow">I worked at a big mansion...</font>

654
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:40,815
<font color="yellow">as a resident helper.</font>

655
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:42,775
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

656
00:42:45,545 --> 00:42:48,075
<font color="yellow">Then please leave your number with me.</font>

657
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:49,885
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

658
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:53,975
<font color="yellow">Goodness. What brings you here?</font>

659
00:42:54,245 --> 00:42:56,215
<font color="yellow">I came to cook you lunch.</font>

660
00:42:56,345 --> 00:42:58,345
<font color="yellow">- What? - Lunch.</font>

661
00:42:58,545 --> 00:43:00,745
<font color="yellow">You said you were craving for sujebi the other day.</font>

662
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,845
<font color="yellow">Where is the kitchen?</font>

663
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:05,385
<font color="yellow">- It's... - Is it there?</font>

664
00:43:26,385 --> 00:43:28,215
<font color="yellow">Come and eat sujebi.</font>

665
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:33,715
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

666
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,415
<font color="yellow">I only used flour and zucchini.</font>

667
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:37,945
<font color="yellow">I hope you'll still enjoy it.</font>

668
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:40,545
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Take your seat.</font>

669
00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:41,815
<font color="yellow">Well...</font>

670
00:43:46,175 --> 00:43:48,115
<font color="yellow">I'll give it a try.</font>

671
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:55,275
<font color="yellow">Goodness! It's so good!</font>

672
00:43:56,115 --> 00:43:57,845
<font color="yellow">Is it? That's good.</font>

673
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,075
<font color="yellow">Did you do magic?</font>

674
00:44:00,075 --> 00:44:03,415
<font color="yellow">How can this lump of flour be so tasty?</font>

675
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:05,415
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Elizabeth,</font>

676
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:07,875
<font color="yellow">Grace Kelly's eating well.</font>

677
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:10,675
<font color="yellow">Stop calling me Elizabeth.</font>

678
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:11,945
<font color="yellow">Elizabeth,</font>

679
00:44:12,115 --> 00:44:14,275
<font color="yellow">please visit me more often.</font>

680
00:44:14,275 --> 00:44:17,515
<font color="yellow">We live in the same house anyway. Let's stay close. Okay?</font>

681
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:20,315
<font color="yellow">Go ahead and eat more.</font>

682
00:44:26,645 --> 00:44:28,045
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

683
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:31,575
<font color="yellow">You got too many shots that your veins hid.</font>

684
00:44:40,475 --> 00:44:43,075
<font color="yellow">There you go.</font>

685
00:44:52,415 --> 00:44:53,675
<font color="yellow">Are you exhausted?</font>

686
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:55,515
<font color="yellow">Always.</font>

687
00:44:55,975 --> 00:44:57,015
<font color="yellow">Don't you sleep?</font>

688
00:44:57,645 --> 00:44:59,345
<font color="yellow">I don't have much time to sleep.</font>

689
00:44:59,715 --> 00:45:00,745
<font color="yellow">Why not?</font>

690
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:05,675
<font color="yellow">You must know.</font>

691
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,515
<font color="yellow">Hello. How are you?</font>

692
00:45:31,115 --> 00:45:33,245
<font color="yellow">Include the new five-piece beauty set...</font>

693
00:45:33,245 --> 00:45:34,915
<font color="yellow">in the tax-free items.</font>

694
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,615
<font color="yellow">And tell them to come up with a marketing proposal.</font>

695
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:37,975
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

696
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:40,715
<font color="yellow">I am sorry. I'm working.</font>

697
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:43,415
<font color="yellow">I was actually going to call you.</font>

698
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:46,045
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

699
00:45:46,475 --> 00:45:48,615
<font color="yellow">Do you want me to come to the school now?</font>

700
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:52,215
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

701
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:55,145
<font color="yellow">Did you just say Ji Hoon's grades fell...</font>

702
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,245
<font color="yellow">because of Chang Soo?</font>

703
00:45:57,745 --> 00:46:00,215
<font color="yellow">Actually, Chang Soo...</font>

704
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,545
<font color="yellow">always stays by Ji Hoon even in school.</font>

705
00:46:03,015 --> 00:46:04,975
<font color="yellow">And I found out about this today.</font>

706
00:46:05,315 --> 00:46:07,745
<font color="yellow">I heard they live in the same house.</font>

707
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,515
<font color="yellow">According to Ji Hoon's mom,</font>

708
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:15,015
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo always plays games and listens to music at night,</font>

709
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:18,275
<font color="yellow">and visits Ji Hoon's room.</font>

710
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:22,845
<font color="yellow">So Ji Hoon couldn't concentrate in his studies.</font>

711
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:26,645
<font color="yellow">She wanted me to warn you.</font>

712
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:51,175
<font color="yellow">Hey, why are you crying, Hee Sook?</font>

713
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,015
<font color="yellow">It's nothing.</font>

714
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:56,145
<font color="yellow">Who made you cry, Hee Sook?</font>

715
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:04,415
<font color="yellow">I...</font>

716
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:08,115
<font color="yellow">I think I can't get promoted because I'm from a local college.</font>

717
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:10,515
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

718
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:13,875
<font color="yellow">It's not because you graduated from a local college.</font>

719
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:15,315
<font color="yellow">That's okay.</font>

720
00:47:16,215 --> 00:47:17,315
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

721
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:21,675
<font color="yellow">Other people graduated from a prestigious college.</font>

722
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:24,945
<font color="yellow">I'm the only one...</font>

723
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,275
<font color="yellow">from a local college.</font>

724
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,515
<font color="yellow">Don't cry. Next time,</font>

725
00:47:30,545 --> 00:47:34,375
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure you get promoted.</font>

726
00:47:37,845 --> 00:47:39,775
<font color="yellow">- Do you mean it? - Of course.</font>

727
00:47:40,015 --> 00:47:41,075
<font color="yellow">Trust me.</font>

728
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:49,575
<font color="yellow">Coffee wakes me up.</font>

729
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,775
<font color="yellow">I drank too much last night.</font>

730
00:47:54,315 --> 00:47:56,815
<font color="yellow">Ms. Kang,</font>

731
00:47:57,315 --> 00:48:00,415
<font color="yellow">you make the best coffee.</font>

732
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:02,075
<font color="yellow">Is that so, Manager?</font>

733
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:03,945
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

734
00:48:05,475 --> 00:48:08,145
<font color="yellow">By the way, how do I look today?</font>

735
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:11,215
<font color="yellow">Will my future mother-in-law like me?</font>

736
00:48:11,645 --> 00:48:13,445
<font color="yellow">Yes, she will.</font>

737
00:48:14,115 --> 00:48:15,115
<font color="yellow">You think so?</font>

738
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:18,345
<font color="yellow">But she knows about my past.</font>

739
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:22,815
<font color="yellow">Your teeth are clean. I checked.</font>

740
00:48:23,075 --> 00:48:24,075
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

741
00:48:26,815 --> 00:48:29,945
<font color="yellow">By the way, are you seeing anyone? Do you want me to set you up?</font>

742
00:48:31,045 --> 00:48:32,275
<font color="yellow">Set me up?</font>

743
00:48:40,845 --> 00:48:41,875
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo.</font>

744
00:48:42,445 --> 00:48:45,675
<font color="yellow">- How can you marry my brother? - We already decided.</font>

745
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,545
<font color="yellow">- Move aside. - Hold on.</font>

746
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:51,445
<font color="yellow">How can you hide it for five years?</font>

747
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:53,775
<font color="yellow">How can you do this to me, Hye Joo?</font>

748
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:55,575
<font color="yellow">Excuse me, Manager.</font>

749
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,145
<font color="yellow">- Here's your present. - Thank you, Ms. Kang.</font>

750
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,245
<font color="yellow">Say hello to each other.</font>

751
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:31,345
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

752
00:49:32,815 --> 00:49:33,815
<font color="yellow">Come out.</font>

753
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:36,075
<font color="yellow">Come out!</font>

754
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:38,975
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Let go of me.</font>

755
00:49:40,345 --> 00:49:41,345
<font color="yellow">It hurts.</font>

756
00:49:43,215 --> 00:49:44,215
<font color="yellow">You.</font>

757
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,475
<font color="yellow">How dare you slander my son?</font>

758
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,515
<font color="yellow">Did you disrespect my dear son?</font>

759
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:56,545
<font color="yellow">You should have raised your dear son better.</font>

760
00:49:56,815 --> 00:49:58,645
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Am I wrong?</font>

761
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:02,515
<font color="yellow">Even though we are living in the same building,</font>

762
00:50:02,615 --> 00:50:05,645
<font color="yellow">my son and your son won't be the same when they grow up.</font>

763
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:10,745
<font color="yellow">Chang Soo will never walk the same path as Ji Hoon.</font>

764
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:14,215
<font color="yellow">But look at him now. He's trying to be close friends with him.</font>

765
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:17,715
<font color="yellow">He comes to our house all the time without being invited.</font>

766
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:20,675
<font color="yellow">He's bothering my son, Ji Hoon.</font>

767
00:50:21,045 --> 00:50:23,015

<font color="yellow">You're the one to talk.</font>

773

<font color="yellow">Try to live without causing any harms in this country.</font>

774

<font color="yellow">Me? Causing harms?</font>

775
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:50,675
<font color="yellow">You are one of those selfish moms.</font>

776

<font color="yellow">What? What did you call me?</font>

778
00:50:57,315 --> 00:51:00,475

<font color="yellow">You're hurting your child.</font>

782
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:09,545

783
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:13,145

787
00:51:22,615 --> 00:51:25,915
<font color="yellow">Did you say all I do is eat and stay at home?</font>

788

<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

789
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:30,545
<font color="yellow">Yes, that's all. So what? What are you going to do?</font>

790

<font color="yellow">What?</font>

793
00:51:39,645 --> 00:51:41,815

<font color="yellow">You're a working mom.</font>

797
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:53,615
<font color="yellow">Isn't that true?</font>

798
00:51:56,275 --> 00:52:00,815
<font color="yellow">I'm going insane. Seriously, I'm going crazy.</font>

799

<font color="yellow">Hey, you...</font>

801
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:14,145
<font color="yellow">You ought to learn a lesson by...</font>

802
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:16,345
<font color="yellow">one of 100 thousand working moms.</font>

803
00:52:17,215 --> 00:52:20,445
<font color="yellow">What? I abandoned my children for money? A selfish mom?</font>

804
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:22,545
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

805
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:26,445
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - What is this? You're ignorant.</font>

806
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:30,045

812
00:52:42,115 --> 00:52:44,615
<font color="yellow">What? What did you just say?</font>

813
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,245
<font color="yellow">- Gosh. - You.</font>

814

<font color="yellow">I will sing</font>

827

01:01:08,315 --> 01:01:10,645
<font color="yellow">You took out a student loan from us for four years.</font>

922
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:13,445
<font color="yellow">You should be working and paying us back by now.</font>

923
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,875
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I haven't gotten a job yet.</font>

924
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,615
<font color="yellow">You're sorry?</font>

925
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,915
<font color="yellow">I can't believe this punk.</font>

926
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:32,175
<font color="yellow">Is it our fault that you haven't gotten a job?</font>

927
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:34,375
<font color="yellow">- Is it our fault? - Please don't hurt me.</font>

928
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,475
<font color="yellow">Wait. The girl just went inside.</font>

929
01:01:41,215 --> 01:01:42,375
<font color="yellow">Search that side.</font>

930
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:03,845
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing?</font>

931
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:02,715
<font color="yellow">- How did it go? - I don't think she's here.</font>

932
01:03:03,215 --> 01:03:04,215
<font color="yellow">Let's check that side.</font>

933
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,375
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

934
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:44,545
<font color="yellow">What's going on?</font>

935
01:03:53,715 --> 01:03:56,845
<font color="yellow">We caught them. I don't think we need to take them back to Korea.</font>

936
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:58,545
<font color="yellow">We'll take care of them here.</font>

937
01:03:59,745 --> 01:04:00,875
<font color="yellow">Stay still.</font>

938
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:15,975
<font color="yellow">Mister.</font>

939
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:18,045
<font color="yellow">Can you turn around?</font>

940
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:29,845
<font color="yellow">I said turn around.</font>

941
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:01,745
<font color="yellow">(Father, I'll Take Care of You)</font>

942
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:05,415
<font color="yellow">I heard he already got a job at another company.</font>

943
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:08,345
<font color="yellow">I'm thinking about entering the broadcasting industry.</font>

944
01:05:08,345 --> 01:05:10,715
<font color="yellow">He's sick because he mind is weak.</font>

945
01:05:10,715 --> 01:05:12,675
<font color="yellow">You don't even feed us well.</font>

946
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,845
<font color="yellow">I wish Aunt was my mom.</font>

947
01:05:14,845 --> 01:05:17,745
<font color="yellow">The guy always kisses the girl.</font>

948
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:20,175
<font color="yellow">No one can predict the relationship between a man and a woman.</font>

949
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:21,815
<font color="yellow">I spent most of my time alone.</font>

950
01:05:21,815 --> 01:05:24,645
<font color="yellow">That's why I used my imagination to make up the things I didn't have.</font>
