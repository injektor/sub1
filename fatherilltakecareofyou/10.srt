291

297
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,410
<font color="yellow">How can you sleep here? You just moved into your mother's house.</font>

298
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,310
<font color="yellow">Please go home.</font>

299
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,210
<font color="yellow">I think she's experiencing menopause. She looked depressed.</font>

300
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,770
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, she already experienced it.</font>

301
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,740
<font color="yellow">It's because she has a mean personality.</font>

302
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:36,070
<font color="yellow">Moreover, my mom and I don't get along at all.</font>

303
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,740
<font color="yellow">I'll just sleep here.</font>

304
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:40,340
<font color="yellow">I raised you for nothing.</font>

305
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,170

307
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,440
<font color="yellow">Did you just say "My gosh"?</font>

308
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,570
<font color="yellow">No, I didn't.</font>

309
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,540
<font color="yellow">You don't think I heard you?</font>

310
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,570
<font color="yellow">How dare you talk to me like this? To your own grandmother?</font>

311
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,610
<font color="yellow">You're hurting me.</font>

00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,710
<font color="yellow">That's why I'm hitting you. I'm not hitting you for your happiness.</font>

313
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,970
<font color="yellow">Hey, you.</font>

314
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,610
<font color="yellow">You'd better come here.</font>

315
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,010
<font color="yellow">Go to your mother's house.</font>

316
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,880
<font color="yellow">My mother doesn't like me.</font>

317
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,110
<font color="yellow">Just go to your mother's house.</font>

318
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,010
<font color="yellow">- Stop hitting me. - There's a saying.</font>

319
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,640
<font color="yellow">"If you can't defeat your enemy, be its friend."</font>

320
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,140
<font color="yellow">I think you should follow the saying.</font>

321
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,510
<font color="yellow">Everyone, please save me.</font>

322
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,810
<font color="yellow">Go to your mother's house.</font>

323
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,510
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi.</font>

324
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,810
<font color="yellow">Moong Chi, what's the matter? Are you scared?</font>

325
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,070
<font color="yellow">Are you cold? Should I give you a hug?</font>

326
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,640
<font color="yellow">I didn't get to wrap it nicely. I'm just lending it to you.</font>

327
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,670
<font color="yellow">Please use it well.</font>

328
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,910
<font color="yellow">- How much is it? - That will be 270 dollars.</font>

329
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,510
<font color="yellow">Here you go.</font>

330
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,640
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye. - Thank you.</font>

331
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,070
<font color="yellow">What is all this?</font>

332
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,840
<font color="yellow">Do you have to ask? They're napa cabbages.</font>

333
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,640
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make kimchi?</font>

334
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,640
<font color="yellow">It's so sudden.</font>

335
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
<font color="yellow">When will I do if not today? I should do when everyone's home.</font>

336
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,270
<font color="yellow">Don't just stand there and move them.</font>

337
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,670
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

338
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,270
<font color="yellow">- Did napa cabbages arrive? - Yes, they did.</font>

339
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,810
<font color="yellow">Today's going to be a long day.</font>

340
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,840
<font color="yellow">Why did you buy so many of them?</font>

341
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,270
<font color="yellow">Some of them will go to our children.</font>

342
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,310
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

343
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:57,440
<font color="yellow">Are you going to make kimchi for our children?</font>

344
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,140
<font color="yellow">Why are you surprised? Why?</font>

345
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,640
<font color="yellow">Are you happy that I'm making kimchi for them?</font>

346
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,970
<font color="yellow">Of course, I am.</font>

347
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,670
<font color="yellow">They're busy. They don't have time for this.</font>

348
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,270
<font color="yellow">Since we don't work,</font>

349
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,310
<font color="yellow">we should make for them. Then their lives will be easier.</font>

350
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,810
<font color="yellow">Goodness, this is the best idea you had.</font>

351
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,440
<font color="yellow">I told everyone to come up, today.</font>

352
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,910
<font color="yellow">But still, it would be great if you make kimchi for them...</font>

353
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,440
<font color="yellow">when you do yours.</font>

354
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,370
<font color="yellow">Stop talking and move them to the kitchen.</font>

355
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,870
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mom.</font>

356
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,240
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. Children get sick.</font>

357
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,410
<font color="yellow">I know that.</font>

358
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,310
<font color="yellow">It's an important time for him. I don't want him in the hospital.</font>

359
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,010
<font color="yellow">Then ask your brother to give him a good IV infusion.</font>

360
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,110
<font color="yellow">I don't know. He's been acting weird, too.</font>

361
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,440
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

362
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,310
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Get ready and go.</font>

363
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,610
<font color="yellow">How about you?</font>

364
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,170
<font color="yellow">I have to make kimchi today.</font>

365
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,440
<font color="yellow">I'm so distracted since Ji Hoon's sick.</font>

366
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,770
<font color="yellow">Why does she want to make kimchi? She should just buy it.</font>

367
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,710
<font color="yellow">Anyway, it's so hard to get along with your parents.</font>

368
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,640
<font color="yellow">But take a good care of them.</font>

369
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,740
<font color="yellow">What did you say? Are you mocking me?</font>

370
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,570
<font color="yellow">"Father, I'll take a good care of you."</font>

371
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,940
<font color="yellow">- What did you say? - Okay, I'm going.</font>

372
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,440
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

373
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,410
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, are you going somewhere?</font>

374
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,270
<font color="yellow">Did you get a job?</font>

375
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,770
<font color="yellow">Move.</font>

376
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,970
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

377
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,610
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

378
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,570
<font color="yellow">What happened? Seong Hoon.</font>

379
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,070
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon.</font>

380
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,610
<font color="yellow">Mom, you look scary.</font>

381
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,110
<font color="yellow">Scary? I don't look scary.</font>

382
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,310
<font color="yellow">I need to make kimchi today.</font>

383
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,710
<font color="yellow">Ah In, you're on your own today.</font>

384
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,370
<font color="yellow">- Did you get that? - Yes.</font>

385
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,170
<font color="yellow">Why aren't you coming up?</font>

386
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,340
<font color="yellow">Why did Hee Sook have to teach...</font>

387
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,270
<font color="yellow">Mother how to use the messenger?</font>

388
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, Mother. I'll be there now.</font>

389
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,710
<font color="yellow">We're making Kimchi today. What a happy day.</font>

390
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,340
<font color="yellow">I can't wait to make kimchi with you.</font>

391
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,010
<font color="yellow">I'll try my best to learn from you.</font>

392
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,870
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy.</font>

393
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,970
<font color="yellow">She was born to flatter her superior.</font>

394
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,070
<font color="yellow">My gosh.</font>

395
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

396
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,970
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

397
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

398
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,810
<font color="yellow">Hey Joo, what...</font>

399
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,710
<font color="yellow">are you wearing? Are you going to swim?</font>

400
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,440
<font color="yellow">Do you plan to dig up cockles?</font>

401
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:45,040
<font color="yellow">Or are you an Afghanistan soldier?</font>

402
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,510
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

403
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,540
<font color="yellow">If you put the rubber bucket away and have a gun, that'll be perfect.</font>

404
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,440
<font color="yellow">Should I put my hands in the air?</font>

405
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,210
<font color="yellow">You'd better stop talking.</font>

406
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,010
<font color="yellow">You're pretentious.</font>

407
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,740
<font color="yellow">Then what about you? Are you Heidi from the Alps?</font>

408
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,970
<font color="yellow">Chilli pepper powder will get all over you.</font>

409
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,840
<font color="yellow">How can you wear a white apron and a white hat?</font>

410
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,840
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you are never sincere.</font>

411
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,840
<font color="yellow">- My goodness. - Move.</font>

412
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,640
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, can you please get rid of the scarf on your head?</font>

413
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,740
<font color="yellow">It's scaring me.</font>

414
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,710
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo. Gosh, that's so frightening.</font>

415
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,010
<font color="yellow">Seong Hoon, get in. I'll give you a ride.</font>

416
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,510
<font color="yellow">Where did you get a job?</font>

417
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,910
<font color="yellow">Why do you have to work on Sundays?</font>

418
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,240
<font color="yellow">I'm filming a show, but why do you work on Sundays?</font>

419
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,610
<font color="yellow">- Hey. - You scared me.</font>

420
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,410
<font color="yellow">You'd better go when you have a chance.</font>

421
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,510
<font color="yellow">You, jerk.</font>

422
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,910
<font color="yellow">What was that for?</font>

423
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,310
<font color="yellow">How can you be angry when I was trying to help you?</font>

424
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,440
<font color="yellow">Forget it.</font>

425
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,410
<font color="yellow">- Really? - Seriously?</font>

426
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,270
<font color="yellow">- Yes. - How did that happened?</font>

427
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,810
<font color="yellow">I think he studied too hard.</font>

428
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,310
<font color="yellow">Gosh, is he okay?</font>

429
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,910
<font color="yellow">Yes, he's getting better.</font>

430
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,670
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't you be there for him? He's sick.</font>

431
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,510
<font color="yellow">I should,</font>

432
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,440
<font color="yellow">but I want to help out before I go.</font>

433
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,210
<font color="yellow">What should I do first, Mother?</font>

434
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,870
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

435
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,370
<font color="yellow">I'm so tired.</font>

436
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,440
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, Father, and Mother, please look at the camera.</font>

437
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,340
<font color="yellow">- What are you doing? - I want to post this photo online.</font>

438
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,870
<font color="yellow">Look at the camera. Her arm must be hurting.</font>

439
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,240
<font color="yellow">Here it goes. In 1, 2, and 3.</font>

440
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,140
<font color="yellow">- I took the photo. - How does it look?</font>

441
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,440
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Mother.</font>

442
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,570
<font color="yellow">This is a nice photo, Hee Sook.</font>

443
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,440
<font color="yellow">Mother, where should I put these?</font>

444
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,570
<font color="yellow">Bring them here.</font>

445
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,710
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

446
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,070
<font color="yellow">Put them gently. You're going to ruin them.</font>

447
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,640
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

448
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,740
<font color="yellow">I uploaded the picture online,</font>

449
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,270
<font color="yellow">and my friends said you look really young.</font>

450
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,940
<font color="yellow">- They asked if you're my sister. - Really?</font>

451
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,740
<font color="yellow">Do you seriously believe it?</font>

452
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,440
<font color="yellow">Please tell them to stop it.</font>

453
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,740
<font color="yellow">If she's your sister, is she your mother-in-law?</font>

454
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,570
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you're right.</font>

455
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,070
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed like that?</font>

456
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,340
<font color="yellow">Although we're working today, it's too untidy.</font>

457
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,040
<font color="yellow">I thought it'd be of better help in this.</font>

458
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,810
<font color="yellow">What are you doing now?</font>

459
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,670
<font color="yellow">Slice the radishes now.</font>

460
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,240
<font color="yellow">Hold on, Father.</font>

461
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,910
<font color="yellow">My friends left too many comments,</font>

462
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,670
<font color="yellow">so I'll just reply them quickly.</font>

463
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,440
<font color="yellow">I'm done.</font>

464
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,110
<font color="yellow">Mother, I sliced the carrots.</font>

465
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,840
<font color="yellow">- Put in to the bowl, then. - I will.</font>

466
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,440
<font color="yellow">I'm finished, Father.</font>

467
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,540
<font color="yellow">Actually,</font>

468
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,810
<font color="yellow">I'm so worried about Ji Hoon,</font>

469
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,210
<font color="yellow">so I think I should go see him.</font>

470
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,910
<font color="yellow">I see. Then, you'd better go.</font>

471
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,140
<font color="yellow">Right. You may leave. I'm sorry for that poor smart boy.</font>

472
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,270
<font color="yellow">You can leave.</font>

473
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,210
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about us and just leave.</font>

474
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,740
<font color="yellow">Then,</font>

475
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,070
<font color="yellow">Grandmother, Mother, and Father,</font>

476
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,610
<font color="yellow">I'll get going.</font>

477
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,770
<font color="yellow">- I'm really sorry. - Don't be. Hurry yourself.</font>

478
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,070
<font color="yellow">- I will, Grandmother. - See you.</font>

479
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,410
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, good luck.</font>

480
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:11,940
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

481
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing with napa cabbages?</font>

482
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,940
<font color="yellow">Focus.</font>

483
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,170
<font color="yellow">Okay. I'm sorry.</font>

484
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,940
<font color="yellow">I succeeded in escaping.</font>

485
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,410
<font color="yellow">Let me see. Let's call him.</font>

486
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,740
<font color="yellow">Hello, Sir.</font>

487
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,170
<font color="yellow">I'm Ji Hoon's mom who visited you the other day.</font>

488
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,810
<font color="yellow">Can I visit you to register for your class today?</font>

489
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,570
<font color="yellow">Sorry?</font>

490
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,610
<font color="yellow">He has to take an exam?</font>

491
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,570
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

492
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,110
<font color="yellow">Right. I forgot to invite Hye Joo's grandmother.</font>

493
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,140
<font color="yellow">Wait a minute.</font>

494
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,410
<font color="yellow">Thank you. Please hold on.</font>

500
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,270
<font color="yellow">We're making kimchi today.</font>

501
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,340
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

502
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:42,010
<font color="yellow">Wait for me. I'll be right there.</font>

503
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,410

505
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,110
<font color="yellow">Is she writing a script?</font>

506
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,410
<font color="yellow">- I need more salted seafood. - Okay. Here you go.</font>

514
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,240
<font color="yellow">I walked Moong Chi.</font>

515
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,670
<font color="yellow">I'll help you, too. What should I do?</font>

516
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,140
<font color="yellow">We don't need your help. Just stay in your room.</font>

517
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,940
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo went to take something. Go to the kitchen.</font>

518

<font color="yellow">It's okay.</font>

523
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,410
<font color="yellow">- Let me do it. - It's all right, Seong Joon.</font>

00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,410
<font color="yellow">Please give it to me.</font>

<font color="yellow">take good care of Dong Hui.</font>

535
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,440
<font color="yellow">She grew up without her parents,</font>

536
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,810
<font color="yellow">so she's gone through a lot.</font>

537
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,970
<font color="yellow">Please don't worry. I'll make sure to take care of her.</font>

538
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,210
<font color="yellow">What are you doing in there? I told you I need onion.</font>

539
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,210
<font color="yellow">Okay! I'm on my way.</font>

540
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,610
<font color="yellow">We'll be right there.</font>

541
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,110
<font color="yellow">- I can do it. - Okay.</font>

542
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,910
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

543
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,910
<font color="yellow">What were you doing? You took too long.</font>

544
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,310
<font color="yellow">It'll take all day long because of you.</font>

545
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,610
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

546
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,070
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Grandmother.</font>

547
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,540
<font color="yellow">You're so skillful.</font>

548
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,710
<font color="yellow">Hye Joo, go tell Dong Hui to bring some plum extract.</font>

549
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,870
<font color="yellow">- And tell her to come help us. - Okay.</font>

550
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,670
<font color="yellow">I'll do it for you.</font>

551
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,640
<font color="yellow">What are you doing inside all day long on Sunday?</font>

552
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,240
<font color="yellow">Well, I was working.</font>

553
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,440
<font color="yellow">What work were you doing?</font>

554
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,440
<font color="yellow">I was writing.</font>

555
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,570
<font color="yellow">Do you like your lab top?</font>

556
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,640
<font color="yellow">I do!</font>

557
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,070
<font color="yellow">I was just going to call you to say thank you.</font>

558
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,610
<font color="yellow">We're living in the same house.</font>

559
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,310
<font color="yellow">Anyway, let's go downstairs.</font>

560
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,110
<font color="yellow">They're making kimchi today.</font>

561
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,570
<font color="yellow">Your grandmother wants you to bring plum extract now.</font>

562
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,310
<font color="yellow">Okay. Please wait a minute.</font>

563
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,870
<font color="yellow">Everyone is working. You'd better go help them now.</font>

564
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,070
<font color="yellow">Hurry.</font>

565
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,440
<font color="yellow">Wait.</font>

566
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,170
<font color="yellow">Keep it up.</font>

567
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,870
<font color="yellow">- Okay. - Okay.</font>

568
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,640
<font color="yellow">Wait,</font>

569
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,440
<font color="yellow">do I look especially great today?</font>

570
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,340
<font color="yellow">Why is everyone staring at me?</font>

571
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,110
<font color="yellow">Well,</font>

572
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,910
<font color="yellow">it kind of feels good, though.</font>

573
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,710
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

574
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,710
<font color="yellow">He must have gone out of mind.</font>

575
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,710
<font color="yellow">- He spilled coffee, didn't he? - Wait.</font>

576
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,710
<font color="yellow">What's the matter with you all?</font>

577
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,670
<font color="yellow">Did something happen today?</font>

578
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,070
<font color="yellow">- Here's the online star. - Sorry?</font>

579
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,610
<font color="yellow">What do you mean I'm an online star?</font>

580
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:08,340
<font color="yellow">I told you to be careful.</font>

581
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,370
<font color="yellow">Be careful of what?</font>

582
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,040
<font color="yellow">I guess you haven't seen it yet.</font>

583
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

584
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,780
<font color="yellow">Someone filmed this scene.</font>

585
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,110
<font color="yellow">- It's really hot. - Gosh, look what happened.</font>

586
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

587
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,210
<font color="yellow">Wait... This... This isn't what you think.</font>

588
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,110
<font color="yellow">This is not it.</font>

589
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,410
<font color="yellow">All of you were right here when this happened!</font>

590
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,780
<font color="yellow">Who edited this out of context? It's so evil.</font>

591
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,310
<font color="yellow">Come forward right now.</font>

592
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,510
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang.</font>

593
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,970
<font color="yellow">Ms. Jang, did you see this?</font>

594
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,410
<font color="yellow">Move. Don't come near me.</font>

595
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,670
<font color="yellow">What? My gosh.</font>

596
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
<font color="yellow">What shall we do?</font>

597
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,740
<font color="yellow">How could she live like this?</font>

598
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,710
<font color="yellow">Why doesn't she just go ahead and camp out in the living room?</font>

599
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,070
<font color="yellow">It's better if she was wandering in the mountain and the sea.</font>

600
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,340
<font color="yellow">Why did she have to move back and upset me?</font>

601
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,280
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to do with her.</font>

602
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,570
<font color="yellow">Mom, what are you doing?</font>

603
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,570
<font color="yellow">Where have you been?</font>

604
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,040
<font color="yellow">Where did you sleep last night?</font>

605
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,010
<font color="yellow">I slept at grandmother's house.</font>

606
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,210
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

607
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,910
<font color="yellow">How could you stay out overnight when you just got back?</font>

608
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,140
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? I slept at grandmother's house.</font>

609
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,540
<font color="yellow">That's still staying out overnight.</font>

610
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,240
<font color="yellow">Why would you sleep at grandmother's house when you have a home?</font>

611
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,410
<font color="yellow">It's not my first time sleeping at grandmother's house.</font>

612
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,540
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

613
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,780
<font color="yellow">Forget it. Let's stop here.</font>

614
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,440
<font color="yellow">And leave it. I'll clean it up.</font>

615
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,810
<font color="yellow">What a rude wench.</font>

616
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,510
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting me?</font>

617
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:00,170
<font color="yellow">How dare you raise your voice to your mother?</font>

618
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,310
<font color="yellow">Are you sure you're my daughter?</font>

619
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,140
<font color="yellow">Then are you sure you're my mother?</font>

620
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,170
<font color="yellow">What? Say that again!</font>

621
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,540
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with sleeping at grandmother's house?</font>

622
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,140
<font color="yellow">I've been living at grandmother's house my entire life.</font>

623
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,170
<font color="yellow">I attended school from her house from elementary school to college.</font>

624
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,340
<font color="yellow">This isn't new. What's wrong with you?</font>

625
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,570
<font color="yellow">How many nights did I spend here?</font>

626
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:23,370
<font color="yellow">Even when I spent nights here, all you did was playing that piano.</font>

627
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,210
<font color="yellow">Have you ever spent a night with me?</font>

628
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,170
<font color="yellow">How could you say such things?</font>

629
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,210
<font color="yellow">Have you ever read me a book?</font>

630
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,710
<font color="yellow">Have you ever woken me up for school?</font>

631
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:34,740
<font color="yellow">What about a field trip? Have you ever packed me lunch?</font>

632
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,140
<font color="yellow">Grandmother or Aunt did all these for me.</font>

633
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,040
<font color="yellow">Hey. It was hard for me to give birth to you.</font>

634
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,840
<font color="yellow">Do you think you're the only one who had a hard time?</font>

635
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

636
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,970
<font color="yellow">Because you weren't married when you had me?</font>

637
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,140
<font color="yellow">Han Jeong Eun.</font>

638
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,370
<font color="yellow">Yes. My name is Han Jeong Eun.</font>

639
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,970
<font color="yellow">I'm listed on Aunt and Uncle's family registry.</font>

640
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,610
<font color="yellow">So why is it so bad about sleeping at Grandma's place?</font>

641
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,910
<font color="yellow">How dare you speak to me like this?</font>

642
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,070
<font color="yellow">Don't worry.</font>

643
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,370
<font color="yellow">I'll make money.</font>

644
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,110
<font color="yellow">And I'll leave Korea again.</font>

645
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,040
<font color="yellow">How could she...</font>

646
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,440
<font color="yellow">It's over there.</font>

647
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,070
<font color="yellow">How can it be?</font>

648
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,610
<font color="yellow">This is a mere misunderstanding.</font>

649
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,940
<font color="yellow">It's a conspiracy and defamation. Someone's plotting against me.</font>

650
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,640
<font color="yellow">This is all Ms. Jang's fault.</font>

651
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,510
<font color="yellow">My goodness.</font>

652
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:07,540
<font color="yellow">What happened? What is this?</font>

653
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,780
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

654
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,440
<font color="yellow">What are you going to do?</font>

655
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,810
<font color="yellow">Do you know how much this car is?</font>

656
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,910
<font color="yellow">I bought it with 36-month installment plan.</font>

657
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,710
<font color="yellow">I still have 28 months to go. It's a new car.</font>

658
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,340
<font color="yellow">He's making a fuss.</font>

659
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,240
<font color="yellow">Wait, I thought I was supposed to pile up the bricks there.</font>

660
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,670
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't pile up the bricks here.</font>

661
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,640
<font color="yellow">Why would you pile up the bricks here?</font>

662
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,170
<font color="yellow">What am I going to do?</font>

663
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,310
<font color="yellow">I apologize.</font>

664
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,910
<font color="yellow">Is that all?</font>

665
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,210
<font color="yellow">How are you going to fix this?</font>

666
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,440
<font color="yellow">We'll compensate for the damage.</font>

667
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,710
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the compensation.</font>

668
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:56,010
<font color="yellow">How are you going to fix my car?</font>

669
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,310
<font color="yellow">Goodness.</font>

670
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,710
<font color="yellow">Are you feeling better?</font>

671
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,310
<font color="yellow">A little.</font>

672
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,710
<font color="yellow">That's why you shouldn't study too hard.</font>

673
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,310
<font color="yellow">You know I can't.</font>

674
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,440
<font color="yellow">Right.</font>

675
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,940
<font color="yellow">But,</font>

676
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,670
<font color="yellow">let's try our best, okay?</font>

677
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,070
<font color="yellow">Have your meal.</font>

678
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,340
<font color="yellow">Look at you.</font>

679
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,440
<font color="yellow">I didn't know you were eating.</font>

680
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,370
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

681
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,870
<font color="yellow">Did you sleep well?</font>

682
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,870
<font color="yellow">Yes?</font>

683
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,740
<font color="yellow">Maybe it's the sleep. You look much better.</font>

684
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,910
<font color="yellow">Right, Min Seok?</font>

685
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:05,040
<font color="yellow">I'm glad it's nothing serious.</font>

686
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,440
<font color="yellow">Thanks to Min Seok,</font>

687
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,910
<font color="yellow">you'll get better.</font>

688
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,940
<font color="yellow">I brought you a gift.</font>

689
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,170
<font color="yellow">I understand it must have been hard for you to study.</font>

690
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,840
<font color="yellow">I bought you something you like.</font>

691
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,310
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

692
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,210
<font color="yellow">It's the headphone...</font>

693
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,070
<font color="yellow">you wanted to have.</font>

694
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,970
<font color="yellow">You don't like when I listen to music.</font>

695
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,610
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't listen to music for long.</font>

696
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:38,140
<font color="yellow">You can listen to it once in a while,</font>

697
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,340
<font color="yellow">but not too long. You know what I mean, right?</font>

698
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:47,840
<font color="yellow">But Ji Hoon, do you need to stay in the hospital?</font>

699
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,340
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

700
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,110
<font color="yellow">What do you mean? Where will he be if not here?</font>

701
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,040
<font color="yellow">Min Seok, I want to him discharged today.</font>

702
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,940
<font color="yellow">No way. He can't be discharged.</font>

703
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,240
<font color="yellow">If he can sit up and eat,</font>

704
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,310
<font color="yellow">- he is recovered. - Hee Sook.</font>

705
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,740
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon, there's an important exam, tomorrow.</font>

706
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,210
<font color="yellow">Remember the boarding academy that I talked out before?</font>

707
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,440
<font color="yellow">The one you were supposed to go during the winter break.</font>

708
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,640
<font color="yellow">It became a competitive academy to get in. You have to take a test.</font>

709
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,570
<font color="yellow">But do you know why it became competitive?</font>

710
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,340
<font color="yellow">The students who studied there...</font>

711
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,710
<font color="yellow">all went to either Seoul National University or KAIST.</font>

712
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,010
<font color="yellow">- That's why you should... - Come outside.</font>

713
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,670
<font color="yellow">- Come outside. - What are you doing?</font>

714
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,210
<font color="yellow">Min Seok.</font>

715
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,540
<font color="yellow">Come here.</font>

716
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,770
<font color="yellow">Min Seok.</font>

717
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,870
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

718
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,840
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your mind?</font>

719
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,410
<font color="yellow">How can you think of taking him home when he hasn't fully recovered?</font>

720
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,610
<font color="yellow">He has recovered.</font>

721
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,670
<font color="yellow">Do you think he's recovered?</font>

722
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,440
<font color="yellow">He hasn't? Look at him. He's sitting up and eating.</font>

723
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,670
<font color="yellow">Min Seok.</font>

724
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,410
<font color="yellow">It's an important time for Ji Hoon.</font>

725
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,570
<font color="yellow">He doesn't have time to be in the hospital.</font>

726
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:05,170
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't get into that academy, he won't get into the gifted school.</font>

727
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,710
<font color="yellow">What's the point when your son isn't well?</font>

728
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,440
<font color="yellow">You can still raise him well without sending him to that school.</font>

729
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,170
<font color="yellow">Min Seok.</font>

730
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:26,510
<font color="yellow">You're talking like this because he isn't your son.</font>

731
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,170
<font color="yellow">How about you, Min Seok?</font>

732
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,610
<font color="yellow">You sent your three daughters to a boarding school in the States.</font>

733
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,870
<font color="yellow">You send them millions of dollars for their education.</font>

734
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,970
<font color="yellow">How could you talk to me like this?</font>

735
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:40,610
<font color="yellow">You don't even live with your wife for your children's education.</font>

736
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:42,310
<font color="yellow">There's a reason to it.</font>

737
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,510
<font color="yellow">I have my reasons, too.</font>

738
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,240
<font color="yellow">Did you forget?</font>

739
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,770
<font color="yellow">How our father treated us differently?</font>

740
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,010
<font color="yellow">I'm not going to raise my son like he raised me.</font>

741
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,110
<font color="yellow">It's a very important exam.</font>

742
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:05,010
<font color="yellow">He can just go for a day tomorrow.</font>

743
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,370
<font color="yellow">No, he can't. You can't take him there.</font>

744
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,940
<font color="yellow">No, I will. He's my son.</font>

745
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,040
<font color="yellow">Don't get involved.</font>

746
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,370
<font color="yellow">Hee Sook.</font>

747
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,270
<font color="yellow">Fine.</font>

748
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,710
<font color="yellow">If this is what you want, you can stay here tonight.</font>

749
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,540
<font color="yellow">But I'll bring you textbooks and study materials.</font>

750
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,810
<font color="yellow">You'll prepare for the exam here,</font>

751
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,210
<font color="yellow">and I'll drive you to the academy for the exam tomorrow.</font>

752
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,510
<font color="yellow">Rest. I'll be back soon.</font>

753
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,910
<font color="yellow">Hooray!</font>

754
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,370
<font color="yellow">Hello.</font>

755
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,140
<font color="yellow">Hi, Chang Soo.</font>

756
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,340
<font color="yellow">Are you here to see Ji Hoon?</font>

757
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,710
<font color="yellow">Yes. I won these two dolls.</font>

758
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,340
<font color="yellow">I want to give them to Ji Hoon.</font>

759
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,770
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

760
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,170
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it looks just like you.</font>

761
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,370
<font color="yellow">I think so, too.</font>

762
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,610
<font color="yellow">Why is it so hard?</font>

763
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,570
<font color="yellow">His parents give him food, shelter, and they pay for his school.</font>

764
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,510
<font color="yellow">The least he can do is listen to his parents.</font>

765
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,910
<font color="yellow">The nurses here listen to what you say, right?</font>

766
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:04,370
<font color="yellow">Why would they do that?</font>

767
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,110
<font color="yellow">It's because you pay their salaries.</font>

768
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,570
<font color="yellow">His parents do all that stuff for him.</font>

769
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,540
<font color="yellow">Then he should listen to them.</font>

770
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,770
<font color="yellow">If he doesn't want to, he should go out and live by himself.</font>

771
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:20,010
<font color="yellow">- You rascal. - He receives his Mom's help.</font>

772
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,710
<font color="yellow">It's ridiculous that...</font>

773
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,110
<font color="yellow">he doesn't listen to such a good mom.</font>

774
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,440
<font color="yellow">You do well at school, don't you?</font>

775
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,410
<font color="yellow">Please don't ask me that.</font>

776
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:39,440
<font color="yellow">Anyway, I hope...</font>

777
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,810
<font color="yellow">you'd help Ji Hoon.</font>

778
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,640
<font color="yellow">I won't be a good help to him.</font>

779
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,370
<font color="yellow">It's not like I can switch our moms.</font>

780
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,740
<font color="yellow">Poor Ji Hoon.</font>

781
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,070
<font color="yellow">If it was as simple as class duty, I'd switch them for him.</font>

782
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,940
<font color="yellow">Dr. Kang.</font>

783
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,440
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon disappeared.</font>

784
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,610
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

785
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

786
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,240
<font color="yellow">What should we do, Dr. Kang?</font>

787
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,340
<font color="yellow">Let's check that side.</font>

788
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,140
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon. - Ji Hoon.</font>

789
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,610
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. What should I do?</font>

790
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,070
<font color="yellow">- He's not there? - He's not.</font>

791
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,210
<font color="yellow">- What should we do? - Please come down.</font>

792
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,010
<font color="yellow">Please don't do that.</font>

793
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,070
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

794
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,440
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. Why are you doing this?</font>

795
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,210
<font color="yellow">What do you think you're doing? Come down at once.</font>

796
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,310
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon!</font>

797
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,110
<font color="yellow">Uncle.</font>

798
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,540
<font color="yellow">I don't want to live any more.</font>

799
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:55,670
<font color="yellow">Come down first. We'll talk after you come down.</font>

800
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,740
<font color="yellow">You shouldn't do this.</font>

801
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,510
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon. Please calm down, and get down here. Ji Hoon.</font>

802
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:03,810
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.</font>

803
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,410
<font color="yellow">You understood me,</font>

804
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,810
<font color="yellow">but I don't think I can hold out any longer.</font>

805
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:10,870
<font color="yellow">Ji Hoon.</font>

806
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,410
<font color="yellow">Mom wants me to go to a boarding school.</font>

807
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,410
<font color="yellow">Do you know what people do there?</font>

808
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,410
<font color="yellow">They study all day every day.</font>

809
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,110
<font color="yellow">I will...</font>

810
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,010
<font color="yellow">convince your mom, okay?</font>

811
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,840
<font color="yellow">- So please come down here. - That's not going to work.</font>

812
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,870
<font color="yellow">She will kill me.</font>

813
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,270
<font color="yellow">She will send me to a boarding school and kill me eventually.</font>

814
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:37,010
<font color="yellow">Rather than dying while being forced to study,</font>

815
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,410
<font color="yellow">I'll just kill myself instead.</font>

816
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,910
<font color="yellow">- Watch out! - Don't come near me.</font>

817
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,710
<font color="yellow">I will kill myself! I'll do it!</font>

818
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,640
<font color="yellow">Let go of me! I will kill myself.</font>

819
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,970
<font color="yellow">- Ji Hoon. It's okay. - I want to die! I'm going to die!</font>

820

<font color="yellow">- Calm down. - Let me go.</font>

821

00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,440
<font color="yellow">- No. - Get off of me!</font>

823
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,940

826
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,210
<font color="yellow">How could you forget to buy the pork?</font>

827
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,840
<font color="yellow">You should buy the pork first before you buy napa cabbage.</font>

828
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,770
<font color="yellow">Why bother make kimchi for winter? We don't even have pork.</font>

829
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,740
<font color="yellow">Why would I make kimchi without pork?</font>

830
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,270
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother. I forgot to buy it. I'm so sorry.</font>

831
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,970
<font color="yellow">There're things you must not forget.</font>

832
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:36,440
<font color="yellow">You know the things I like.</font>

833
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,710
<font color="yellow">How could you forget to buy it?</font>

834
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:40,740
<font color="yellow">I guess I've been too lenient.</font>

835
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,210
<font color="yellow">Not at all, Mother. That's not true.</font>

836
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,370
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, Mother. Please forgive me.</font>

837
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,410
<font color="yellow">Freshly made kimchi with...</font>

838
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:51,610
<font color="yellow">softly boiled pork,</font>

839
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,970
<font color="yellow">a little oyster,</font>

840
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,210
<font color="yellow">and a bit of pickled shrimp wrapped together.</font>

841
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,040
<font color="yellow">You know how much I love to eat it.</font>

842
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,770
<font color="yellow">Imagining it makes me want to eat it even more.</font>

843
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,640
<font color="yellow">I'm so sorry.</font>

844
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:08,710
<font color="yellow">I guess I did get old. Please forgive me.</font>

845
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,040
<font color="yellow">I can never let this slide, Jeong Ae!</font>

846

<font color="yellow">- Starting from today... - Mother, please.</font>

847

848
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,410
<font color="yellow">You can just have pork tomorrow.</font>

849
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:23,510
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

850
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:26,540
<font color="yellow">She worked hard all day to make kimchi.</font>

851
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,670
<font color="yellow">Why are you tormenting her?</font>

852
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,110
<font color="yellow">Grandma.</font>

853
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,570
<font color="yellow">I can't take this.</font>

854
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,310
<font color="yellow">Are you lecturing me right now?</font>

855
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,040
<font color="yellow">Yes. I am lecturing you.</font>

856
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:41,370
<font color="yellow">You're an elder. Why are you being...</font>

857
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:43,010
<font color="yellow">so petty over food?</font>

858
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,510
<font color="yellow">What did you just say?</font>

859
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,040
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? I said come in.</font>

860
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,740
<font color="yellow">I am coming in.</font>

861
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,540
<font color="yellow">Ms. Oh.</font>

862
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:01,710
<font color="yellow">How could you do that to me in front of the kids?</font>

863
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,540
<font color="yellow">Your daughter-in-law was on her knees in front of me.</font>

864
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,240
<font color="yellow">You should consider her, too.</font>

865
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,210
<font color="yellow">She's in her 60s, and she got scolded in front of me.</font>

866
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,240
<font color="yellow">That's not right.</font>

867
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,670
<font color="yellow">That's for me to decide. I decide that!</font>

868
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,070
<font color="yellow">I can scold my daughter-in-law in my own house.</font>

869
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,870
<font color="yellow">No matter how upset you are,</font>

870
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,440
<font color="yellow">please consider the circumstances and behave appropriately.</font>

871
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:28,940
<font color="yellow">When have I ever behaved inappropriately?</font>

872
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,210
<font color="yellow">Gosh.</font>

873
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,940
<font color="yellow">You're so childish.</font>

874
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,070
<font color="yellow">What did you say?</font>

875
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,810
<font color="yellow">- Thank you. - Goodbye.</font>

876
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,810
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

<font color="yellow">(Butcher's shop)</font>

878
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,440
<font color="yellow">Aren't you tired?</font>

879
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,970
<font color="yellow">I've made kimchi before. My grandma used to run a grocery store.</font>

880
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,410
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

881
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,040
<font color="yellow">Have you written the script?</font>

882
00:54:56,870 --> 00:55:00,340
<font color="yellow">Just a little. I thought I should write as much as I can on weekends.</font>

883
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,440
<font color="yellow">Thank you so much for the laptop.</font>

884
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,240
<font color="yellow">It's no problem.</font>

885
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:06,840
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyway.</font>

886
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,070
<font color="yellow">Don't go to the library any more.</font>

887
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,710
<font color="yellow">Don't stay late in the office, either.</font>

888
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,840
<font color="yellow">Did you know?</font>

889
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:17,140
<font color="yellow">Of course. Now I know everything you do.</font>

890
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:24,110
<font color="yellow">That's right. I didn't tell you about the rental fee.</font>

891
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,270
<font color="yellow">- Are you going to make me pay? - Of course.</font>

892
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:29,210
<font color="yellow">Nothing is free in this world.</font>

893
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,210
<font color="yellow">Show me.</font>

894
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,440
<font color="yellow">- Show you what? - Your script.</font>

895
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,810
<font color="yellow">- What? - That laptop is very expensive.</font>

896
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,270
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

897
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:44,770
<font color="yellow">please let me be the first one to read your script.</font>

898
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,640
<font color="yellow">Okay?</font>

899
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,610
<font color="yellow">I'll think about it.</font>

900
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,040
<font color="yellow">Hi, Mi Joo.</font>

901
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,810
<font color="yellow">What's up?</font>

902
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,440
<font color="yellow">What are you doing, Seong Joon?</font>

903
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,910
<font color="yellow">Well, I came outside.</font>

904
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,610
<font color="yellow">It's weekend. Why didn't you call me?</font>

905
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,440
<font color="yellow">You said you'd be playing golf with the directors.</font>

906
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,010
<font color="yellow">I just came home.</font>

907
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:27,570
<font color="yellow">Mr. Park is a golf maniac. I'm so tired.</font>

908
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,070
<font color="yellow">You must be. Did your golf skills get any better?</font>

909
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:32,710
<font color="yellow">I can play singles now.</font>

910
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:35,610
<font color="yellow">Gosh. That's amazing.</font>

911
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,440
<font color="yellow">What did you do today?</font>

912
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,070
<font color="yellow">- We made kimchi today. - You made it?</font>

913
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,670
<font color="yellow">My mom did. I just helped her.</font>

914
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,510
<font color="yellow">Mi Joo. I'll call you back.</font>

915
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:54,440
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui! Wait for me.</font>

916
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,810
<font color="yellow">Seong Joon.</font>

917
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,170
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

918
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,110
<font color="yellow">Dong Hui.</font>

919
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,270
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at?</font>

920
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,040
<font color="yellow">Dear Lord, our family made kimchi for winter today.</font>

921
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,440
<font color="yellow">We do it around this time every year.</font>

922
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,740
