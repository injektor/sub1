1
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,131
I like drinking solo.

2
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,861
I talk all day long for my job.

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:17,231
Hence, I thoroughly enjoy not having to talk like this...

4
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,661
and wholeheartedly appreciate this moment of solitude.

5
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,691
This academy is huge.

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,161
Yes. I work in Noryangjin starting today.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,091
He's our hope. Meet Professor Jin Jung Suk.

8
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,431
Are you Mr Jin Jung Suk?

9
00:00:27,431 --> 00:00:30,791
90 percent of the exam-takers take his classes.

10
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,491
He's the top instructor when it comes to the civil service exam.

11
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,391
Hi, Mum. I'm in Noryangjin.

12
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:36,431
Why? You told me to take the civil service exam.

13
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,661
I thought Noryangjin would be super depressing, but it's not the case.

14
00:00:38,661 --> 00:00:40,561
You get to live on allowance from your mum,

15
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,931
but you don't have to deal with her nagging. Living here is amazing!

16
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,031
I'll be in charge of your Korean. I'm Park Ha Na.

17
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,191
What do you think of Professor Park's lecture?

18
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,691
She worked in an academy in the outskirts, right?

19
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,191
You can tell her background.

20
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,731
Did you read the post on Professor Jin's page...

21
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,791
that claims Professor Jin forged his academic credentials?

22
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:54,291
The person who wrote even said to have evidence.

23
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:55,931
Dong Young, come on.

24
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:57,591
Come on, can't you be considerate?

25
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,591
You know my family is saving up to help me study.

26
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,191
I feel so bad. I need to pass the test as soon as possible.

27
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,731
Let's break up.

28
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,731
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

29
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,591
This should've happened a long time ago.

30
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:08,761
I'm sorry that I couldn't let you go sooner.

31
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:11,031
I'm not interested in doing a joint class with these instructors.

32
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,931
He's really High-quality Trash.

33
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,931
Does he think he's entitled to be condescending to us?

34
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,061
She is inexperienced and has a mediocre academic background.

35
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:18,431
I absolutely cannot work with that No Geu Rae.

36
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,691
Is it that important to you?

37
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:20,931
Is that why you forged yours?

38
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,131
How are you going to explain this?

39
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:24,231
No one with your name graduated from Seoul National University.

40
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,661
Professor Jin, could you please explain this?

41
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,261
Jin Sang is my birth name.

42
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,961
I started using, Jin Jung Suk, when I first came to Noryangjin.

43
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:31,991
What's she doing? It's dangerous to fall asleep there.

44
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,761
Excuse me. Wake up. You should go home.

45
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,191
Gosh, that's the last bus! Sir, please wait!

46
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,261
Don't leave yet, Sir!

47
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,061
Excuse me! Please throw my shoes over here.

48
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:40,391
- Oh, okay. - Hurry up!

49
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:43,161
- Isn't she the Korean instructor? - Hurry!

50
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:45,631
What are they doing right now?

51
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:47,191
Gosh, my shoe!

52
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,761
I need my shoe!

53
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:55,531
(Episode 3)

54
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,431
I like drinking solo.

55
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,731
I talk all day long for my job.

56
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,591
Hence, I thoroughly enjoy not having to talk like this...

57
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,561
and wholeheartedly appreciate this moment of solitude.

58
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,031
I have my own rules for enjoying drinking solo.

59
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:32,491
First. I must have a quality time in a classy ambiance.

60
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,461
Second.

61
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:36,861
There must be high-quality drink accompaniments.

62
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:39,631
Third.

63
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:42,861
I seek to promote a mindful and high-quality drinking culture.

64
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:47,561
I never drink...

65
00:03:47,691 --> 00:03:49,861
until my blood alcohol content goes over 0.080 percent.

66
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,531
It's because that number represents...

67
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,961
when I feel happily tipsy.

68
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:04,931
Come on. Drink up.

69
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,161
Look at them. I hate drinking with a bunch of loud people like them.

70
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,491
Drinking solo allows me time to solely focus on myself.

71
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,091
It's such a healing experience.

72
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,031
That's why...

73
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,231
I love drinking by myself.

74
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,661
I lost my shoe...

75
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:40,731
and looked stupid all day.

76
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:45,631
What a crazy day.

77
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,261
What's this fool doing?

78
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:51,591
Come in!

79
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:55,061
- Come in. - Mum, please.

80
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,791
I want you to take care of this fool.

81
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,931
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

82
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,591
Do you think anybody can take and pass the civil service exam?

83
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,291
What? Anybody?

84
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,561
Mum.

85
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:15,761
Do you know how difficult that exam is?

86
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:17,231
He won't be able to pass it.

87
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,931
You know that studying isn't his strong suit.

88
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,591
That's right. He sounds super annoying,

89
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,931
but he's not wrong.

90
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,731
It's true that I'm not cut out for studying...

91
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,091
Be quiet.

92
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:29,191
I'm not cut out for looking after you.

93
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:35,631
I mean, we can't let him stay unemployed forever.

94
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:38,361
You're the most famous instructor in Noryangjin.

95
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:41,161
Let him live with you and help him get a job in the government, okay?

96
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:42,491
I can't.

97
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,861
I cannot force someone with no will power to study.

98
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,431
Plus, I do not want to live with him.

99
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,561
That pathetic loser can't even figure his own life out.

100
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:50,161
Why do I have to live with him?

101
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:54,961
Look who's talking! I don't want to live with you, either!

102
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,931
Shut it, you fool.

103
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,791
I told you to obey your brother. Did you not hear me?

104
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:02,591
I will.

105
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:11,831
Stop saying no.

106
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:16,191
Can you please...

107
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,291
think about it again? Please?

108
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:19,961
You know me, Mum.

109
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:22,161
I cannot live with anyone.

110
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,491
Living alone is so comfortable.

111
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,561
If you want him to study for the exam, get a small flat for him.

112
00:06:26,731 --> 00:06:28,861
If you don't want to pay for it, I can take care of the rent...

113
00:06:28,961 --> 00:06:30,561
Money isn't the issue here!

114
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:33,731
I live with him now, yet he's still wasting his life away.

115
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,391
What would he do if we let him live alone?

116
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:37,231
Who knows what that fool is capable of doing?

117
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,191
You have to live with him,

118
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:41,331
so that he at least watches his behaviour.

119
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:43,791
Gong Myung and I really don't get along, Mum.

120
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,061
I know that the two of you are like polar opposites.

121
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,831
I wish Gong Myung was as smart...

122
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,761
and competent as you.

123
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:58,731
You two are so different even though you're siblings.

124
00:07:01,891 --> 00:07:03,131
That's exactly why I don't want to live with him.

125
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:07,031
Have I ever forced you into doing anything you don't want to do?

126
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,761
Even when you quit preparing to become a professor...

127
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,161
to teach at academies,

128
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,991
I trusted that you'd make the right decision...

129
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,531
even though I was extremely upset and worried about it.

130
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:16,191
That's why I didn't say anything to you.

131
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,131
This is the very first time I'm asking you for a favour like this.

132
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,061
You really can't do it for me?

133
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:23,831
Son, please?

134
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,561
Grant me my wish!

135
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:40,891
You should eat, too.

136
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,791
I made this cheonggukjang from scratch for you.

137
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:45,131
It's very delicious.

138
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:47,731
It's okay. I'll just have a glass of juice.

139
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,561
Why did you make such a smelly dish for breakfast?

140
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,931
Gosh, you're so picky.

141
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,791
I think it smells amazing.

142
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,331
Mum, I'm disappointed in you.

143
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,861
You've never prepared so much food for me.

144
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:04,061
How many dishes are there?

145
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:05,531
Be quiet.

146
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:08,761
If you're unhappy with it, pass the exam and start earning money.

147
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:14,061
Right. Gong Myung will sign up for your academy today.

148
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,031
I thought it'd be a good idea for him to study where you teach.

149
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,131
What?

150
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,061
Hey.

151
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,431
Don't tell anyone you're my brother.

152
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,061
When they find out I have a brother with no future like you,

153
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,061
no one will want to take my classes.

154
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:30,291
That makes sense.

155
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:34,591
They'll wonder why you can't even teach your own brother well.

156
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:36,591
I hope it won't happen.

157
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,461
Gong Myung, don't let others know he's your brother.

158
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:43,891
Fine. That's what I want, too.

159
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,131
I don't want others to know that...

160
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,031
a jerk like him is my brother.

161
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,691
- What? - Do you have a problem?

162
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:53,831
Will you be quiet?

163
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:56,961
I told you to obey your brother.

164
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:58,301
It hurts.

165
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:04,461
Anyway, please take good care of this brat.

166
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,301
I'll visit often.

167
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,891
You don't have to.

168
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,491
Just send us enough money.

169
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:10,991
Look at you.

170
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,261
I just don't want to bother you.

171
00:09:13,361 --> 00:09:14,591
Of course.

172
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:24,461
Do I have to even care about how I look now?

173
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,231
Gosh.

174
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:31,761
I promised I'd become prettier.

175
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,431
Is this enough?

176
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,431
Hello.

177
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,831
Did you read my text?

178
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:08,991
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:14,191
I'm sorry for revealing that...

180
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,991
your real name is Jin Sang.

181
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:19,631
So what?

182
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,661
"Now that I've apologised, let me teach the joint class."

183
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,161
Is that what you mean?

184
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,331
That's not it.

185
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:28,831
I'm okay with not teaching the joint class.

186
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,661
I just wanted to apologise.

187
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,961
All you want is to apologise?

188
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,931
Yes. I have no other purpose.

189
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,331
If that's your only purpose,

190
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:44,461
I'll accept your apology.

191
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:50,261
In return, never mention the joint class in front me again.

192
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,691
Do you understand, No Geu Rae?

193
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,731
Yes.

194
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:07,361
On your message board,

195
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,661
all they talk about is how you look.

196
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,331
That's not true.

197
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,791
- They're so cheeky. - Right?

198
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,191
Hi, Professor Jin.

199
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,761
- Hello. - You came in together.

200
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:22,631
Have you apologised to him?

201
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,491
Yes.

202
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:26,661
Really? Is he going to let you teach the joint class?

203
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:30,661
No. He told me never to mention the joint class again...

204
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:33,031
in return for him accepting my apology.

205
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:34,431
What are you talking about?

206
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,961
What are you going to do now?

207
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:39,691
You should have begged him.

208
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:43,561
Mr Kim, I'll attract more students to my existing class.

209
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,531
- Please trust me. - How would I trust you?

210
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,431
Why are you so confident?

211
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:51,231
Did you check the reviews on your class?

212
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,991
It was unbelievable.

213
00:11:52,991 --> 00:11:55,361
Why? Did I get a lot of bad reviews?

214
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,931
Dream on.

215
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:01,761
See it for yourself.

216
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,661
You have no reviews, which is worse than bad reviews.

217
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,161
This is your reality.

218
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,931
People who leave bad comments are at least interested in you.

219
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,161
If you don't want to go back to an unknown academy,

220
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:14,731
join the joint class, okay?

221
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:18,391
You're making me upset so early in the morning.

222
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,191
She's hopeless.

223
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:33,761
Is this Detective Lee Jae Han? This is Lieutenant Park Hae Young.

224
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,031
Is it Lee Je Hoon in "Signal" today?

225
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,731
You got me.

226
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:41,091
Detective Lee Jae Han.

227
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:44,691
At 9am, September 12, 2016.

228
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:46,991
I arrived at the office on time.

229
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,091
Are you on time, too?

230
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:51,931
Detective Lee.

231
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,291
You're unbelievable.

232
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:58,761
Prepare for your class if you have time to practise that.

233
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,691
From this early morning,

234
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,291
you guys are getting on my nerves.

235
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,591
Why is he so on edge today?

236
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:11,891
I'm just trying. What's wrong with him?

237
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:15,431
Was my class that bad?

238
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,891
I did my best.

239
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,031
Noryangjin...

240
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,691
I knew it'd be hard,

241
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,431
but this is...

242
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,061
too big of a burden for me.

243
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:35,131
Do you want burgers?

244
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,261
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:39,331
I said, it's a burden.

246
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,891
I'm worried.

247
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,591
Do you want water?

248
00:13:43,591 --> 00:13:44,791
Forget it.

249
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:53,591
- Are you going to take the exam? - Yes, I am.

250
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,031
What can I do?

251
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,731
Mum will make me work on the orchard otherwise.

252
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,961
Your orchard is quite big.

253
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,631
You could inherit it.

254
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:03,791
They'll pay me 100 dollars a month.

255
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,591
Do you think I'll inherit it?

256
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,161
I'll just be their slave.

257
00:14:08,731 --> 00:14:10,261
It's a better idea to prepare for the exam.

258
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,291
Are you going to live in the residence?

259
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,961
No, I moved into my brother's house.

260
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,391
Do you mean the one that's very smart unlike you?

261
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:20,261
- Is he working? - Yes,

262
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:23,691
- he's doing very well. - Then again,

263
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,291
if he was such a good student, it's only natural.

264
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,161
This is why you should study hard.

265
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,561
You figured that out very fast, didn't you?

266
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:33,791
Where's Dong Young? Has he already started working?

267
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,731
No, he texted me this morning.

268
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:38,331
He's sick, so he wants me to fill in for him.

269
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:41,131
He skipped meals so often to study. It's no wonder.

270
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,761
Are you sure you can do it?

271
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:45,861
- I've done it a few times. - Jung Chae Yeon.

272
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,931
You look tired these days. Drink this and cheer up.

273
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,931
Forget it. Put it away.

274
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,461
There's another blind guy.

275
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,131
She's famous for being pretty in Noryangjin.

276
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,891
Can you believe that? Doesn't she look plain?

277
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:00,631
I'd never go out with her...

278
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,661
- even if I could. - Why? She's quite pretty.

279
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,131
What are you talking about?

280
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,461
- Just take it. - I said, no.

281
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:10,061
If you're here to study, focus on your studies.

282
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,461
What?

283
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:16,561
- Good morning. - Good morning.

284
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,991
What are you doing there? Will you sit down?

285
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:21,461
Okay.

286
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:27,791
- Why... - Cheer up.

287
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,191
Okay?

288
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,831
Thank you. I appreciate it.

289
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:41,761
All right. Today, we'll learn about "Ode to the Deceased Sister".

290
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,861
(Ode to)

291
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:54,391
What's wrong with me?

292
00:15:55,561 --> 00:15:56,661
I shouldn't do this.

293
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:08,731
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,631
Because I don't have a lot of students...

295
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:17,661
and there were no reviews about my class,

296
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:19,631
I was very sad.

297
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:21,491
But...

298
00:16:23,161 --> 00:16:25,391
to realise there's someone who roots for me,

299
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:29,331
I feel so sorry and ashamed.

300
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:30,991
So many emotions go through me.

301
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,561
What is it?

302
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:38,091
Why do I feel so embarrassed?

303
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:41,231
If she finds out it was originally for Chae Yeon,

304
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,891
she'll be so embarrassed.

305
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,661
Be quiet.

306
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:49,561
Until every one of you passes the exam,

307
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:53,491
I'll give the best lectures I can.

308
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,161
Cheer up, Ms Park!

309
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:58,491
Cheer up!

310
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:01,361
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

311
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,161
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

312
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,931
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

313
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,561
- Thank you. - Cheer up!

314
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,461
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

315
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,131
- Cheer up! - Cheer up!

316
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:13,931
What's going on here?

317
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:18,631
After promising she'd become prettier, why does she cry?

318
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:19,831
It makes her look uglier.

319
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,161
My goodness.

320
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,031
Professor Park.

321
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,091
Do you have any questions?

322
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:38,691
No, I don't.

323
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,591
I have something to give you.

324
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,961
It's my shoe.

325
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:47,361
Excuse me! Please throw my shoes over here.

326
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:48,591
Hurry up!

327
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,031
Hurry!

328
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:58,231
Was it you that threw me my heels?

329
00:17:58,361 --> 00:17:59,361
Yes.

330
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:00,931
I'm so glad.

331
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,961
These are pretty new, so I was upset to lose it.

332
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,061
Thank you so much.

333
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:07,561
You should eat lunch.

334
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,561
I'd love to treat you.

335
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,661
Pardon?

336
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,501
Okay, I won't decline.

337
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:15,591
I forgot my wallet.

338
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:17,391
Can you wait for me downstairs?

339
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:18,731
Sure.

340
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:23,131
Ha Na.

341
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:25,931
Ta-da.

342
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,231
Look at this.

343
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,461
What are these?

344
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:33,691
I ordered promotional tissue for you.

345
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:35,161
Isn't it nice?

346
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,061
Since you're not in High-quality Trash's joint class,

347
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:39,231
you should do your best to get more students.

348
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,691
She made it just for you.

349
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,061
Thank you so much, Jin Yi.

350
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,261
It's nothing. I told you,

351
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:47,231
I'll help you in every way I can.

352
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,931
This is great. I'm going out for lunch,

353
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,831
so I should hand these out on my way back.

354
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:56,231
Just hire some kids to hand them out.

355
00:18:56,331 --> 00:18:58,461
No, I'll just see my prospective students in person.

356
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,791
- I'll be back. - Have a good one.

357
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:02,061
Bye.

358
00:19:02,061 --> 00:19:05,461
Gosh. She's so excited.

359
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,891
You should have asked me to chip in.

360
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,191
I've been feeling bad about the joint class.

361
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:12,691
It doesn't cost much.

362
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:17,531
Anyway, I want Ha Na to get a lot of students.

363
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,691
Detective Lee Jae Han.

364
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:26,791
Professor Hwang just performed a good deed.

365
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,061
If this keeps up,

366
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,691
Professor Park's future can be changed.

367
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,461
I want Professor Park to be happy.

368
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:35,501
What are you doing?

369
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,891
"What are you doing?"

370
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,001
I'm on the walkie-talkie.

371
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,591
You helped me get my shoes back.

372
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:46,661
I could have taken you to somewhere nicer.

373
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:48,361
It's okay. I like kalguksu.

374
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:55,861
- Excuse me. - Use this.

375
00:19:57,501 --> 00:19:58,501
Thank you.

376
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,131
(Park Ha Na's Korean Class)

377
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,261
What is this?

378
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,061
It's tissue for promotional purposes.

379
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,161
- I plan on handing it out after. - I see.

380
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:11,561
You should talk more comfortably with me.

381
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,731
It's weird to have an instructor talk so formally.

382
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:17,031
Okay. I will, then.

383
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:21,261
Like you said, I'm your instructor.

384
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:23,131
I can't believe the first time we met...

385
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,131
I ended up showing my clumsy self.

386
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,691
I'm so embarrassed.

387
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:29,891
I wasn't that professional in the classroom, either.

388
00:20:30,431 --> 00:20:31,761
Are you having a hard time?

389
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:34,731
Not at all.

390
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:38,591
Even if it's tough, I'm sure it's not as bad compared to you.

391
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:41,761
My students' lives depend on this exam.

392
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,061
I hope I can be helpful to those people.

393
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,161
All I did was cry.

394
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:50,861
- I'm ashamed. - Don't be.

395
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:54,691
You don't have to be in front of me.

396
00:20:54,831 --> 00:20:56,831
I'm not here because I want to become a government employee.

397
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:58,791
I was forced here by my mum.

398
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,431
Studying is not my thing.

399
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:03,791
I have a weak will.

400
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,231
Why is that?

401
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:09,231
I think you'll do great.

402
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,531
- Pardon? - First,

403
00:21:11,691 --> 00:21:13,561
it means you already acknowledge your problem.

404
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:16,761
If you know your problem, that means it can be fixed.

405
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,591
I think...

406
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,501
you'll do well.

407
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:23,631
Really?

408
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:27,231
I'll try not to be so foolish around you guys any more.

409
00:21:27,691 --> 00:21:30,231
I'll do my best, so you should, too.

410
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,331
Okay?

411
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,501
One second.

412
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:37,261
Yes.

413
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:39,061
Pardon?

414
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:43,061
Sure, I'll be right there. Okay.

415
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,361
I'm sorry, something came up. I have to go,

416
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:47,731
- but finish your food. - I'm sorry?

417
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,861
I'm done, too. Wait for me.

418
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:55,031
What was that?

419
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,931
Didn't she just say she won't be foolish?

420
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,531
Gosh.

421
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,831
(Residence)

422
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:09,991
Are you feeling sick?

423
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:11,931
I got you some porridge.

424
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,991
What's with all the tissue?

425
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:21,131
I thought you skipped work because you're sick.

426
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,591
Is this what you were up to?

427
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:26,391
How disgusting.

428
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:28,591
You did it so many times.

429
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:30,761
You're so cheap when it comes to everything else.

430
00:22:30,831 --> 00:22:32,531
Why did you waste so much tissue on this?

431
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,031
You have a girlfriend, too. Save it for later.

432
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:36,661
You'll really get sick from that, you know.

433
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:39,931
Why aren't you saying anything?

434
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,131
Are you embarrassed?

435
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:46,931
What is this? Are you crying?

436
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:49,061
Why are you crying?

437
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,031
We broke up.

438
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:53,961
Ju Yeon and I.

439
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:55,491
What?

440
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,561
Are these tissues...

441
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,161
from crying, then?

442
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,161
You didn't get my syllabus?

443
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:11,561
I swear I sent it.

444
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:12,791
Well,

445
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:14,561
I saw it in my inbox.

446
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,631
I think I missed it by accident.

447
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:20,031
- I'm sorry. - It's okay as long as you have it.

448
00:23:20,391 --> 00:23:22,131
I better go now.

449
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,331
Hi, Mum. What is it?

450
00:23:28,461 --> 00:23:30,131
What is it?

451
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:35,491
The lease is over already?

452
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,231
How much are you short?

453
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:39,961
What?

454
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,391
10,000 dollars?

455
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,031
Yes.

456
00:23:43,461 --> 00:23:45,331
I have to pay for the lease.

457
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:49,261
As you know, I don't have that much money.

458
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:52,931
I left my previous job without getting three months of pay.

459
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,031
I know.

460
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:57,831
What should we do?

461
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:01,561
I lent all of my money to my boyfriend.

462
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:04,891
His business isn't doing well.

463
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:06,291
I see.

464
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,661
I'll ask around for you.

465
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:09,931
Thank you.

466
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,031
What is this?

467
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:13,061
Professor Park, are you in need of money?

468
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:16,791
I thought you were from a rich family...

469
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:18,531
since you didn't bother...

470
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:21,161
begging Professor Jin.

471
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:22,561
Was I wrong?

472
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:24,691
What do you mean?

473
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:25,731
Then...

474
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:28,391
get into Professor Jin's joint class somehow.

475
00:24:28,531 --> 00:24:30,861
If you do, I'll get you an advance. Not a problem.

476
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,561
- Pardon? - Right.

477
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:36,231
You'd get that much money as an incentive in no time.

478
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:38,061
There's no problem with giving you an advance.

479
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:39,491
Are you serious?

480
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:41,831
Yes. Just persuade Professor Jin.

481
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,361
You know,

482
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:46,531
Korean instructor on the eighth floor is eyeing that spot.

483
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:47,991
You might lose it if you wait.

484
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:51,061
Isn't that professor really famous?

485
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:52,791
I feel like it'd be better for you...

486
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,431
to have that professor in the joint class...

487
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,991
Of course it's better. A whole lot better.

488
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:00,431
Except for this.

489
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,061
That professor is too expensive.

490
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:07,731
If I gave everyone the same incentive, I'll go broke.

491
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,861
How can you drink coffee?

492
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,491
Go and talk to High-quality Trash right now.

493
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,731
Cry if you have to. Just get him to let you join.

494
00:25:21,131 --> 00:25:22,131
It's okay.

495
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,261
I promised not to bring up the joint class again.

496
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,461
His real name would have never been revealed...

497
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,391
if it wasn't for me.

498
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:31,561
I shouldn't be so shameless.

499
00:25:31,591 --> 00:25:32,891
Who cares?

500
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:35,391
You should flatter him and give him gifts.

501
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:37,761
You must try everything you can.

502
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,991
She's right. You need money.

503
00:25:41,461 --> 00:25:43,031
I better go.

504
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,931
Gosh.

505
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:48,031
What are we going to do with her?

506
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,661
Detective Lee Jae Han.

507
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:53,531
What on earth happened in 1989...

508
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,061
to make Professor Park be born so clueless?

509
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:59,261
Since we can't change the past, the future...

510
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,491
Enough is enough, Professor Min.

511
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:04,061
This is no time for that!

512
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,261
What should I do?

513
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:12,361
If I get into the joint class,

514
00:26:12,631 --> 00:26:14,431
everything will be resolved.

515
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:18,431
Should I really try to go and persuade him?

516
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,291
I really don't want to do this.

517
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:25,761
Sometimes there are things you have to do even if you don't want to.

518
00:26:27,891 --> 00:26:28,891
Is that so?

519
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:33,331
Then do you think I should try everything I can...

520
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:35,761
like what Jin Yi and Professor Min said?

521
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,061
Professor Jin.

522
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,561
Are you going somewhere?

523
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:46,831
To the office. I'm meeting my assistants.

524
00:26:46,931 --> 00:26:49,331
I see. Go ahead.

525
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:54,831
I have to...

526
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,861
bring up the joint class soon.

527
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:02,291
(Jin Jung Suk Office)

528
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:05,291
I want you to pay more attention to the comments on my page.

529
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:08,061
Make sure you answer based on my materials.

530
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,861
Don't make any arbitrary decisions.

531
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,691
- Do you understand? - Yes.

532
00:27:13,731 --> 00:27:15,561
Is the new textbook out for the joint class?

533
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,761
Yes, we're in the final stages of editing.

534
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:19,061
If you're busy, I can do it.

535
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,031
No, I'll do it myself.

536
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,531
You have a delivery.

537
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:28,691
Is Professor Jin Jung Suk here?

538
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:29,691
That's me.

539
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,691
What is this?

540
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:37,431
Dear respectable Professor Jin.

541
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,961
Please forget about what happened last time...

542
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,961
and allow me to join your joint class.

543
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,491
With most sincere regards, Park Ha Na.

544
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,061
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class!

545
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,461
She'll tell you exactly what's going to be on the exam.

546
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,731
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class.

547
00:28:12,061 --> 00:28:13,561
Gosh, people are so cold.

548
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,391
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class.

549
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,961
What are you doing right now?

550
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,631
Why do you even care?

551
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:27,761
What? Are you out of your mind?

552
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,661
Why are you distributing these?

553
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:30,991
You said we should pretend to be strangers.

554
00:28:31,061 --> 00:28:32,331
Just continue along.

555
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:35,731
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class.

556
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,791
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class.

557
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:40,161
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class.

558
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:42,931
Take Park Ha Na's...

559
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,061
Goodness, what is his problem?

560
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:47,991
He's such a jerk!

561
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,561
Hey, Ki Bum.

562
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:56,591
What?

563
00:28:57,631 --> 00:28:58,831
Gosh, this fool.

564
00:28:59,331 --> 00:29:01,261
Ease up! Drink slowly.

565
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:04,861
Hey, I haven't seen that shirt before by the way.

566
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,861
This? Ju Yeon got me this as a breakup gift.

567
00:29:08,061 --> 00:29:09,591
It makes me think about how heartbroken...

568
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,861
she must've been while picking this out for me.

569
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:14,231
Ju Yeon.

570
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:16,931
Ju Yeon.

571
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:18,461
Don't let her go if you're still so hung up on her.

572
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,931
- It's not too late yet. - No, I don't deserve her.

573
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,261
I can't let her go through a rough patch because of me.

574
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:25,491
Letting her go is the right thing to do.

575
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:27,661
- Then don't whimper about it. - You have no idea...

576
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,291
how amazing she is.

577
00:29:31,161 --> 00:29:34,331
She's prettier than any of the girls...

578
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:37,661
- that are here right now. - Then don't let her go.

579
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:38,831
I told you.

580
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:41,731
- I must let her go. - Then stop going on about it.

581
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:44,991
Look around. Ju Yeon is also...

582
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:47,391
more voluptuous than the girls that are here.

583
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:49,561
I won't be able to meet a girl like her ever again.

584
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:52,961
- Ju Yeon... - Then beg her to come back.

585
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:55,161
- I told you that I must let her go! - Gosh, then just shut your mouth...

586
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,531
and cry your eyes out!

587
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,631
Why are you so chatty? You're so annoying.

588
00:30:03,131 --> 00:30:04,861
Is it true?

589
00:30:05,491 --> 00:30:06,961
- Did Ju Yeon really break it off? - They're done.

590
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,031
Gosh, my Ju Yeon...

591
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:12,991
Ju Yeon!

592
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,991
If I take everything into consideration, the commission...

593
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,561
Professor Jin.

594
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:21,331
You're just getting in now?

595
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:25,431
I've been waiting for you because I want to talk to you about something.

596
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,461
- What is it about? - Well, it's...

597
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:30,561
It's about the joint class.

598
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:33,531
Can you please consider letting Professor Park in?

599
00:30:34,161 --> 00:30:36,731
I've been thinking hard about it,

600
00:30:37,231 --> 00:30:39,031
and it looks like joining the joint class you're in...

601
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:42,631
is the only way we can help her become more known among students.

602
00:30:44,191 --> 00:30:45,791
Where is she right now?

603
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,861
Now? She's probably at the staff room. Why do you ask?

604
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,031
I'm sorry to make you do this,

605
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:54,661
but please tell her to meet me at the terrace.

606
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,731
Oh, that's no problem. Okay, consider it done.

607
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,631
Where is Professor Park right now?

608
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:03,991
Professor Park?

609
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:05,531
Oh, there she is! Professor Park.

610
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:12,061
Professor Jin wants to talk to you at the terrace now.

611
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:14,291
- Pardon? He wants to talk to me? - Yes.

612
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:19,331
I practically begged him to let you join his joint class.

613
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,731
It looks like I finally managed to persuade him.

614
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,831
Why are you just standing there? Hurry up and go talk to him.

615
00:31:27,031 --> 00:31:28,431
Yes, thank you so much.

616
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:42,831
Hello. I heard you want to speak to me about something.

617
00:31:44,131 --> 00:31:45,491
What is your problem?

618
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,161
I beg your pardon?

619
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,931
- Why do you have these... - How can you make our students...

620
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:57,191
distribute these, knowing that every second matters to them?

621
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:58,461
How can you call yourself an instructor?

622
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,561
You don't deserve this job.

623
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,461
That's not what happened. I left these at a restaurant and...

624
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:04,161
What was this about?

625
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,061
- Pardon me? - You said you wanted to...

626
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:07,591
let me know how sorry you really are.

627
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:09,731
This must be what you actually wanted.

628
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:12,591
You were doing whatever it takes to win me over to join the class.

629
00:32:12,591 --> 00:32:15,061
- What do you mean? I don't know... - That's enough.

630
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:18,391
I hate people like you who do whatever it takes for their goals.

631
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:22,731
I must say that you're a lot worse than I expected.

632
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,391
Gosh, what was that about?

633
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:30,931
These tissues are one thing, but...

634
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,061
what is this?

635
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,491
Who did this?

636
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:44,761
You sent him a gift certificate and made it look like Ha Na did it?

637
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,861
Yes, I did.

638
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:50,991
You ordered those tissues to help her promote her classes,

639
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,561
so I was wondering if there's anything I can do for her.

640
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:58,761
This means that you aren't the one who changed his mind, Mr Kim.

641
00:32:58,991 --> 00:33:00,561
It must've been my gift.

642
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:02,661
I'm sure Professor Jin...

643
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,891
changed his mind after receiving my gift.

644
00:33:05,891 --> 00:33:09,291
Really? This is the first time you did something to be praised on.

645
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,891
- Good job. - Good work.

646
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:17,691
Detective Lee.

647
00:33:18,191 --> 00:33:21,031
Mr Kim complimented me for the very first time today.

648
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,831
This world has finally become a pretty good place to live.

649
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,691
Are you in a good place, too?

650
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,061
- Gosh, that was so funny! - Who was that?

651
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:30,661
Is it because I'm in a good mood right now?

652
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:32,731
That impersonation was so hilarious.

653
00:33:32,731 --> 00:33:34,331
Stop it. I'm feeling too happy because of you two.

654
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:35,531
Okay, I'm sorry.

655
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:38,591
- Oh, there she is. - Hey, Ha Na!

656
00:33:39,161 --> 00:33:42,291
Congratulations, congratulations

657
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:44,991
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations

658
00:33:47,491 --> 00:33:48,731
Congratulations, Professor Park!

659
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,261
So you'll be teaching the joint class with us, right?

660
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:53,931
Take us out for a meal! I'm not sure if you've heard,

661
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:57,461
but I sent him a gift and made it look like it was from you.

662
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:59,291
He changed his mind because he was moved by it.

663
00:34:00,761 --> 00:34:01,791
Sorry?

664
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:05,791
So you're the one who sent this to him?

665
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,731
What happened? Why did he give this to you?

666
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:11,191
- Did he reject it? - Is that why he wanted to see you?

667
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,131
So he still doesn't want you to be in the joint class?

668
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,461
- That's right. - What?

669
00:34:15,461 --> 00:34:16,901
I practically begged him.

670
00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:19,931
Goodness, Professor Jin is being way too mean about this.

671
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:22,461
I know that all of you tried your best to help me.

672
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,161
It doesn't look like you need to do anything about it any more.

673
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,461
- Wait, Professor Park. - Ha Na.

674
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:37,291
Hey, stop drinking.

675
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:38,991
- Just let me be. - Why are you being so...

676
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,531
Hey, try to get in touch with her.

677
00:34:42,931 --> 00:34:44,461
- It's not too late yet. - Forget it.

678
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,731
I'm sure Ju Yeon thought hard about it before making the decision.

679
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,261
- Being clingy won't solve anything. - Yes, that's right.

680
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:53,631
I want you guys to hold onto my phone.

681
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:55,191
- Why? - I'm worried...

682
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,761
that I might end up calling or messaging her.

683
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,561
- That will break her heart. - Hey.

684
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,531
- Just don't do it. - Who knows what I'll do...

685
00:35:04,031 --> 00:35:06,731
when I black out?

686
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:09,191
Okay. But what is this?

687
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,261
Is this a prop from the TV series, "Reply 1997"?

688
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:13,361
How old is this phone?

689
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,931
It looks ancient like the one in the TV series.

690
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:19,131
- You should also hold onto this. - Your wallet? Why?

691
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,431
I'm worried that I might end up grabbing a taxi to go see her...

692
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:23,791
- if I have cash on me. - Hey, just don't do that.

693
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,361
I told you. Who knows what I'll do...

694
00:35:25,361 --> 00:35:28,931
- after drinking until I drop? - All right. Okay.

695
00:35:29,991 --> 00:35:32,631
Goodness. Is this a wallet or a rag?

696
00:35:37,061 --> 00:35:39,361
You don't even have enough to pay the minimum fare for a taxi.

697
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:41,901
You're seriously so ridiculous.

698
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,861
- Jin Yi. - Yes?

699
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:50,161
You said you'd ask around about the money.

700
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:51,591
Thanks in advance for your help.

701
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:53,361
Don't worry about it.

702
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:56,961
I'll get going, then.

703
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,861
Professor Park, are you heading home?

704
00:35:59,361 --> 00:36:01,461
Let's have dinner together. It's on me.

705
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,461
I'll pass. I don't really have any appetite right now.

706
00:36:08,691 --> 00:36:09,931
Get home safely, Ha Na.

707
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,831
Have a good evening, Mr Kim.

708
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:19,291
All right. You, too.

709
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:25,061
She seems so down.

710
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,031
How can she not be?

711
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,191
I mean, she can't join the joint class after all.

712
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,061
We should do something.

713
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:34,261
Shall we go out for drinks with Professor Jin...

714
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:36,491
to try to persuade him again to let Ha Na in?

715
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:39,991
Yes! That's such a great idea.

716
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,031
Are you leaving now?

717
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:47,831
Professor Jin, let's go grab a drink.

718
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,531
I made it clear that I do not drink with co-workers.

719
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:52,361
Please don't say that. Let's just have one drink together.

720
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:54,331
I have something important to talk to you about as well.

721
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:55,931
Professor Jin, please!

722
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,831
Come with us.

723
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,031
You don't want to?

724
00:37:03,231 --> 00:37:05,131
- I apologise. - Have a good evening, everyone.

725
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,691
- Okay. You, too. - But...

726
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,761
See you tomorrow, Professor Jin.

727
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:12,231
Even my beauty isn't enough to persuade him.

728
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,231
How can he be that cold?

729
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:16,931
He crushed my pride.

730
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,991
I'm leaving, too.

731
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:22,591
Where do you think you're going? You made me feel like drinking.

732
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,591
Come on. The three of us should still go out for drinks.

733
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:26,131
Professor Hwang, what do you feel like?

734
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:29,691
Hey, are you okay?

735
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:31,691
I'm not okay.

736
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:35,631
Everywhere I go, I think about the moments I shared with Ju Yeon.

737
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:37,561
How can I be okay?

738
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:43,591
Ju Yeon and I used to come to this café often.

739
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:45,831
Ju Yeon always...

740
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:49,591
ordered a caffe mocha with loads of whipped cream on it.

741
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,061
Also,

742
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:55,461
Ju Yeon liked that Chinese restaurant, too.

743
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,291
She'd always...

744
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,861
pour vinegar over the pickled radish.

745
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,991
We've been to that motel, too.

746
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:13,731
There, Ju Yeon would...

747
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,691
What did she do there?

748
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,831
Why do you want to know that?

749
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:20,561
You talked in detail about what happened in other places.

750
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:23,191
Why can't you tell us what happened in the motel? Shame on you.

751
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,361
- What? - Guys.

752
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:27,131
Please stop it, you idiots.

753
00:38:28,591 --> 00:38:29,861
Ki Bum.

754
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:31,691
Check my phone.

755
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,861
Has Ju Yeon sent me anything?

756
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,991
Why would she? That's not going to happen.

757
00:38:35,991 --> 00:38:38,291
- Just check it. - Fine.

758
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,461
This is my phone.

759
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:46,161
This is my wallet.

760
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:54,491
I think I left it at the bar.

761
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,731
What? You idiot!

762
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:04,031
Have you seen any phone or wallet?

763
00:39:04,131 --> 00:39:05,931
It's a very old phone...

764
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,261
and a worn-out wallet...

765
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,631
that no one would want to steal.

766
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:11,461
- I haven't seen anything. - She hasn't seen anything.

767
00:39:11,631 --> 00:39:12,631
Hey.

768
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,831
Could you have left it in the bathroom?

769
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:17,261
I'm sure it's in there. I'll go and look.

770
00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:18,261
Go ahead.

771
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:21,861
My goodness.

772
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:25,731
Who would steal such a piece of junk?

773
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:26,831
Right?

774
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:31,161
Let go of me! Are you crazy?

775
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:32,761
I'll buy you a new one.

776
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,031
That's not the point.

777
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:35,961
What if Ju Yeon has called me?

778
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,431
What if she finally took up her courage...

779
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:41,131
- and thought I ignored her call? - That's just false hope.

780
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,531
Ju Yeon will never call you.

781
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,031
How do you know that?

782
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:46,531
How? It's obvious.

783
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:49,231
She must be sick of waiting for you to pass the exam.

784
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:51,061
- What? - She got a job.

785
00:39:51,261 --> 00:39:52,901
I'm sure she already found another guy.

786
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,901
Her face and body that you liked so much...

787
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:56,861
are already someone else's.

788
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,061
What?

789
00:39:58,191 --> 00:39:59,831
What's wrong with you?

790
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,901
People are staring at us. Let go of me.

791
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,931
- Let go of me. - It hurts.

792
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,661
- Let go of me. - You let go of me.

793
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:06,791
- Let go of me. - Let go of me.

794
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,631
- Let go of me. - Let go of me.

795
00:40:08,731 --> 00:40:10,231
- Let go of me. - Are you crazy?

796
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:12,031
- What did you say? - What's up with you?

797
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:13,691
Are you out of your mind?

798
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,661
What are you doing? Stop it.

799
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:17,731
- Get off of me. - Let go of me.

800
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,061
Let go of me, will you?

801
00:40:19,191 --> 00:40:20,761
Let go of me right now.

802
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,791
What's the problem with you?

803
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:24,791
- Let go of me! - Let go of me!

804
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:26,331
- Let go of me! - Let go of me!

805
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:27,761
- Let go! - Let go of me!

806
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:28,991
Let go!

807
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:30,231
Let go on three.

808
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,591
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

809
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:33,861
- Let go! - Let go!

810
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:35,961
- Hey! - Let go!

811
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,231
People are watching us.

812
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:39,931
Let go of me!

813
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:42,761
- Mr Kim, thank you for the dinner. - Thank you.

814
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:44,861
Where should we go now?

815
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,831
Just pick any place.

816
00:40:46,931 --> 00:40:49,131
We're not in the position to be picky.

817
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:51,431
I'm so upset about Professor Jin.

818
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:52,631
So am I.

819
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:55,401
Why can't he talk it out with us over drinks?

820
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:58,161
Why does he never drink with us?

821
00:40:58,261 --> 00:40:59,461
Does he not like drinking?

822
00:40:59,931 --> 00:41:01,761
What do you mean I don't like drinking?

823
00:41:01,861 --> 00:41:03,331
I love it.

824
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,561
Only...

825
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,591
when I drink solo.

826
00:41:35,881 --> 00:41:38,621
Oh my. What a coincidence!

827
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:41,581
I'm so happy to see you!

828
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:44,181
You said you didn't want to drink with us.

829
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:45,481
I know.

830
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:48,251
If you were going to drink alone, why didn't you join us?

831
00:41:48,551 --> 00:41:50,481
You look so lonely.

832
00:41:50,621 --> 00:41:51,921
Drink with us.

833
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:53,321
What are you doing?

834
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:54,821
I prefer drinking alone.

835
00:41:54,921 --> 00:41:57,881
It's always better to drink with other people.

836
00:41:58,681 --> 00:41:59,751
Right.

837
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,951
It can be both a welcome party for Professor Jin...

838
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:03,481
and the joint class team dinner.

839
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:04,881
Let's drink together.

840
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,251
I'm okay. I'll get going.

841
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:07,921
Oh my.

842
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:10,021
Why are you so hasty?

843
00:42:10,121 --> 00:42:11,851
Drink just one glass with us.

844
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:13,451
Sit down first.

845
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:15,621
- Sit down. - Sit down.

846
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:17,181
Just sit down.

847
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:27,791
Here. Call her.

848
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:30,951
Find out if she has called you.

849
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,651
If she hasn't, you're dead meat.

850
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:39,751
Hi, Ju Yeon. It's me.

851
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:42,621
Have you called me?

852
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:45,521
What?

853
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:47,881
You haven't?

854
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:52,221
I just wanted to check.

855
00:42:53,081 --> 00:42:54,081
You haven't.

856
00:42:54,481 --> 00:42:56,021
I see.

857
00:42:56,521 --> 00:42:57,951
I'm sorry. Bye.

858
00:42:59,351 --> 00:43:00,351
I won't...

859
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:02,121
call you again.

860
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:07,221
See? I told you she couldn't have.

861
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,681
You're dead meat.

862
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:17,451
What?

863
00:43:20,951 --> 00:43:21,951
Hey.

864
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,751
Hey, stop it.

865
00:43:26,381 --> 00:43:28,151
Look on the bright side.

866
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:30,381
You said you wanted to pass the exam this year.

867
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:34,081
Now that you don't have a girlfriend, focus on your studies.

868
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:38,051
What would I pass the exam for?

869
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:39,921
I wanted to...

870
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,921
marry Ju Yeon and live happily after passing the exam.

871
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:44,951
There's no Ju Yeon now.

872
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:47,221
Dong Young, there are other girls.

873
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:49,221
What's the big deal?

874
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:51,381
Just get over it.

875
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:52,521
Right.

876
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:54,851
I'll buy you a new phone and a new wallet.

877
00:43:54,951 --> 00:43:56,421
Can't you buy me Ju Yeon, too?

878
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:00,521
I don't think I'll be able to forget her.

879
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,221
You're pathetic.

880
00:44:08,221 --> 00:44:09,451
Stop it.

881
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:13,551
Stop it now.

882
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:17,151
Stop it.

883
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:20,781
I think I'm going to cry.

884
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:22,951
Gosh.

885
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:29,481
Ju Yeon.

886
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:34,021
Stop it.

887
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:37,381
Professor Jin.

888
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:39,881
Can't you let Professor Park...

889
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:41,181
join the joint class?

890
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,951
You should have pity on her.

891
00:44:44,121 --> 00:44:46,121
She's the breadwinner of her family.

892
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:49,321
Her family went bankrupt when she was in college.

893
00:44:49,451 --> 00:44:53,351
She had to pay for her tuitions and her family's living expenses.

894
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:55,321
That's right. She said...

895
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:58,251
she needed 10,000 dollars to pay for her mother's lease.

896
00:44:58,951 --> 00:45:00,081
Oh my.

897
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:03,851
She must so desperately need to join the joint class.

898
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,481
- She must be so desperate. - So desperate.

899
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:08,021
Professor Jin, is it really impossible?

900
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:12,481
Do I work for a charity?

901
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:14,681
Does my joint class exist to help those unfortunate?

902
00:45:20,321 --> 00:45:21,821
Why not?

903
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:24,181
Take this and let her join.

904
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:27,221
I even went to the department store despite my busy schedule.

905
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:29,881
- Why would you? - Me?

906
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:31,951
Well...

907
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,481
Professor Park seemed to not have any social skills.

908
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:39,221
I thought I should help her.

909
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:43,021
I'm such a nice person, right?

910
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:47,181
I pretended that it was Professor Park's idea.

911
00:45:47,281 --> 00:45:48,421
Isn't that amazing?

912
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:52,621
Everyone's asking you. Can't you take her in?

913
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:55,821
It's already over.

914
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:57,381
- Where are you going? - Don't leave.

915
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,251
There's so much food left.

916
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:00,951
I'm going to the bathroom.

917
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,651
I see.

918
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:04,021
Don't run away.

919
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:06,821
We have your bag and jacket.

920
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:13,851
He's unbelievably stubborn.

921
00:46:13,851 --> 00:46:16,021
He seemed angry.

922
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:17,881
Should we stop?

923
00:46:17,951 --> 00:46:18,951
I'm...

924
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:20,221
scared of him.

925
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,081
I'm more scared of my in-laws.

926
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:25,451
After investing some money, they've been nagging me so much.

927
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:29,951
To make up for the money I had to pay Professor Jin,

928
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:31,921
we should make the most use of...

929
00:46:32,021 --> 00:46:34,351
cheap instructors like Professor Park.

930
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:36,121
When Professor Jin comes back,

931
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:38,751
we'll have to persuade him no matter what.

932
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:39,851
We have to.

933
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:41,481
- Here, let's drink. - Cheers.

934
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:42,481
Cheers.

935
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:49,581
What's with No Geu Rae?

936
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:52,181
Why didn't she tell me it wasn't her?

937
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:54,181
She made me look bad.

938
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:02,951
Also, what did she do to those people?

939
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:04,951
Why are they all trying to help her?

940
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:07,551
She's so annoying.

941
00:47:14,021 --> 00:47:15,151
What is this anyway?

942
00:47:15,151 --> 00:47:16,881
What? Hold on.

943
00:47:17,081 --> 00:47:19,521
Let me see. Isn't this a portable breathalyser?

944
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:21,551
He's so strange.

945
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:23,021
Who would he carry this around?

946
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:26,581
It's working, it's working.

947
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:28,281
0.150 percent.

948
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,551
Is this enough to get caught?

949
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:34,551
Detective Lee, I just arrested a drunk driver.

950
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,281
Arrested me? How dare you?

951
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:37,381
Give that to me.

952
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:38,781
Let go.

953
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:43,781
Detective Lee Jae Han. Do they have openings at academies there?

954
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:45,651
If they do, please take Professor Min over.

955
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:47,851
We don't need him in 2016!

956
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:51,051
Don't you dare do it again.

957
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,681
Detective Lee, I think this will be my last message to you.

958
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:56,681
- However, this message... - Give it back.

959
00:47:56,821 --> 00:47:58,821
- Give it to me. I'll break it. - Sir.

960
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:00,221
- This is really expensive. - Let go.

961
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:02,551
- It's expensive. I swear. - Just let go.

962
00:48:02,551 --> 00:48:04,121
- Let go. I'll break it. - Enough with that, just drink.

963
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:05,121
Stop it.

964
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:06,381
Hey, you...

965
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,381
What are you doing?

966
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:21,451
What are you looking at?

967
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:23,921
I wasn't looking. I wasn't.

968
00:48:23,921 --> 00:48:25,351
What are you looking at?

969
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:30,051
- Mr Kim, this is sexual harassment. - Sexual harassment?

970
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:31,851
Sexual harassment.

971
00:48:31,851 --> 00:48:33,051
What are they doing?

972
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:35,151
It's definitely not sexual harassment.

973
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:37,021
They're so low.

974
00:48:37,021 --> 00:48:38,681
It's not sexual harassment.

975
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,051
Gosh.

976
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:41,451
I'm Professor Park Ha Na from CS Pass Academy.

977
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,581
Come and take my Korean class.

978
00:48:43,581 --> 00:48:45,451
I'm Professor Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Thank you.

979
00:48:45,451 --> 00:48:48,381
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Thank you.

980
00:48:48,381 --> 00:48:50,951
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Please come take my class.

981
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:53,081
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. It's nice to meet you.

982
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:13,681
(Park Ha Na's Korean Class)

983
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:47,021
I drink solo...

984
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,081
so that I could overcome the harsh daily life.

985
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,221
It's 10pm already.

986
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:04,481
I better go.

987
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:05,951
- What? - What? Again?

988
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,021
- No way. You can't go. - I have to go.

989
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:09,021
- You can't go. - I have to.

990
00:50:09,021 --> 00:50:10,181
- Really. - No, you can't leave.

991
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:13,881
On days that are so tough, it's hard to drink with others.

992
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:15,551
Come on.

993
00:50:39,551 --> 00:50:41,451
It's like a spell that helps you console yourself...

994
00:50:41,451 --> 00:50:44,681
and admit to the reality of life.

995
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:54,051
That's why I'm drinking solo again today.

996
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:00,951
All right. Let's cheer up.

997
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:05,153
I'm the rising star in Korean. It's Park Ha Na's Korean Class.

998
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:06,684
Come and take my class. Here.

999
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:09,384
Come and take classes for your civil service exam.

1000
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:10,954
It's Park Ha Na's Korean Class.

1001
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:12,924
- Gong Myung. - Professor Park.

1002
00:51:14,484 --> 00:51:16,224
- Do you want some help? - No.

1003
00:51:16,424 --> 00:51:18,524
You handed them out earlier today for me, didn't you?

1004
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:21,154
I was going to ask you tomorrow in class.

1005
00:51:21,154 --> 00:51:22,254
Don't do that again.

1006
00:51:22,254 --> 00:51:23,254
Why not?

1007
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:26,254
Did Professor Jin say something?

1008
00:51:26,924 --> 00:51:29,684
No. I just feel bad.

1009
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:32,424
You should be studying. Don't waste your time on this.

1010
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:35,284
It's okay. It's not like I study that much.

1011
00:51:36,224 --> 00:51:38,884
Don't be like that. You should give your all while you're at it.

1012
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:41,784
I hope you do well and become a government employee.

1013
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:43,324
Go home and study.

1014
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:46,554
Hello, I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy.

1015
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:48,754
It's nice to meet you. Thank you.

1016
00:51:49,384 --> 00:51:51,084
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy.

1017
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:53,224
Hello, I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy.

1018
00:51:53,224 --> 00:51:55,184
Please come and take my Korean class.

1019
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:56,224
Thank you.

1020
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:01,154
(Mr Kim)

1021
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:08,784
- Yes. - Where are you, Professor Jin?

1022
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:10,754
I'm on my way home.

1023
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,384
What? You're going to leave your jacket and your bag?

1024
00:52:14,084 --> 00:52:15,854
- Come and take it. - See you tomorrow.

1025
00:52:16,124 --> 00:52:17,384
Then I'll take these with me...

1026
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:34,324
What is she doing?

1027
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:37,784
Everyone, what do you think syllable means?

1028
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:40,824
It's the smallest unit of speech sounds.

1029
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,824
You're pretty good.

1030
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:47,284
Look. "Sea".

1031
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:48,784
"Sea".

1032
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,024
How many syllables is that?

1033
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:51,824
What are you doing?

1034
00:52:52,184 --> 00:52:53,224
Can't you tell?

1035
00:52:53,554 --> 00:52:55,154
I'm listening to an online lecture.

1036
00:52:55,354 --> 00:52:57,724
The consonants can never...

1037
00:52:57,724 --> 00:53:00,684
What a great teacher you found.

1038
00:53:01,254 --> 00:53:04,154
I'll find you someone better, so take that class instead.

1039
00:53:04,854 --> 00:53:07,324
- Don't listen to someone like her. - What?

1040
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,924
What do you mean?

1041
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:11,724
What's wrong with her?

1042
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:15,154
She taught at a nameless academy in the outskirts of Seoul.

1043
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:16,624
She has a mediocre academic background, too.

1044
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:18,324
What is there to learn from her?

1045
00:53:18,324 --> 00:53:21,124
- Is there a lot to learn from you? - What?

1046
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:23,754
You should speak for yourself. Should you be allowed to lecture?

1047
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,124
You look at the world with so much prejudice.

1048
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:28,884
For example, look at how you're treating me.

1049
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:32,084
The jobless students studying for the civil service exam...

1050
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,724
must look so pathetic to you.

1051
00:53:33,884 --> 00:53:35,854
Before you teach them,

1052
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:38,584
have you ever consoled or sincerely felt sorry for them?

1053
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:39,684
What?

1054
00:53:40,184 --> 00:53:43,784
At least she's sincere.

1055
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:45,184
There are only seven kinds.

1056
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:47,024
You have to memorise these ones.

1057
00:53:47,584 --> 00:53:50,654
To me, she looks like a hundred times better than you.

1058
00:53:50,654 --> 00:53:53,454
Didn't you take her class for the first time today?

1059
00:53:53,454 --> 00:53:56,024
How can you tell if she's sincere or not?

1060
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:58,024
Is that why...

1061
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:00,924
you decided to hand out her promotional tissue...

1062
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:03,784
- when she asked you to help? - She didn't ask me for help.

1063
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:05,884
I did it voluntarily.

1064
00:54:06,524 --> 00:54:08,584
You didn't say anything to her, did you?

1065
00:54:09,024 --> 00:54:10,254
Don't do that.

1066
00:54:10,354 --> 00:54:12,784
She already scolded me for it.

1067
00:54:13,354 --> 00:54:14,424
What?

1068
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:22,954
What is going on? Same goes with the gift certificate.

1069
00:54:23,954 --> 00:54:25,784
Why doesn't she ever speak up for herself?

1070
00:54:30,024 --> 00:54:32,254
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Please come take my class.

1071
00:54:32,254 --> 00:54:34,684
Here, you should take one, too. Thank you.

1072
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,884
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Nice to meet you.

1073
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,254
Try taking a class.

1074
00:54:38,254 --> 00:54:39,754
Hello, it's Park Ha Na's Korean Class.

1075
00:54:39,884 --> 00:54:41,024
Nice to meet you.

1076
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:43,384
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy. Nice to meet you.

1077
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,024
I'm Park Ha Na of CS Pass Academy.

1078
00:54:45,024 --> 00:54:46,384
What is she doing?

1079
00:54:52,884 --> 00:54:55,024
Everyone, what do you think syllable means?

1080
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:58,054
It's the smallest unit of speech sounds.

1081
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:01,684
Gosh. You hardly studied.

1082
00:55:01,854 --> 00:55:03,124
How can you pass out already?

1083
00:55:03,954 --> 00:55:06,424
Hey, are you really asleep?

1084
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,054
It's none other than consonants.

1085
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:12,784
Consonants cannot make syllables on their own.

1086
00:55:12,954 --> 00:55:14,954
You need vowels.

1087
00:55:15,054 --> 00:55:17,084
If you only look at the consonants,

1088
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:18,954
it doesn't work. That's why we need vowels.

1089
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:21,254
Here are the most frequently used ones. Vowels are...

1090
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,584
what allows us to be able to pronounce this word as "sea".

1091
00:55:23,684 --> 00:55:24,684
You understand it now, right?

1092
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,624
Goodness.

1093
00:55:40,284 --> 00:55:41,484
Why did these...

1094
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:45,624
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1095
00:55:48,754 --> 00:55:50,624
I should keep them on. I don't want to lose another shoe.

1096
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:58,054
(Professor Jin Jung Suk)

1097
00:55:58,624 --> 00:55:59,624
What does he want?

1098
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:00,854
Why is he calling me?

1099
00:56:04,024 --> 00:56:05,024
Hello?

1100
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:07,484
Are you confident that you can do a good job in the joint class?

1101
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:09,154
Pardon me?

1102
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:12,484
I'm asking if you're confident that you won't ruin my reputation.

1103
00:56:13,824 --> 00:56:15,954
Sorry? Yes, of course!

1104
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:17,424
I'll do my very best!

1105
00:56:17,684 --> 00:56:19,254
Doing your best is a given.

1106
00:56:20,124 --> 00:56:21,154
You must do a good job.

1107
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:24,284
I'll let you join the class for two months on a trial basis.

1108
00:56:24,454 --> 00:56:26,154
Don't forget that this doesn't mean you can relax.

1109
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:29,484
You'll be kicked out if your classes aren't up to my standards.

1110
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:31,024
Thank you so much!

1111
00:56:31,184 --> 00:56:33,024
I'll be sure not to disappoint you.

1112
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:35,224
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

1113
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:37,484
Thank you very much. I'm so grateful.

1114
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:38,754
Thank you!

1115
00:56:39,184 --> 00:56:40,384
Whatever.

1116
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:44,654
That's such great news!

1117
00:56:45,354 --> 00:56:46,424
I can't believe it!

1118
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:48,524
(The Shortcut to Success)

1119
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:51,884
This made my day.

1120
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:15,924
(Drinking Solo)

1121
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:18,254
Professor Jin puts up a cold front,

1122
00:57:18,354 --> 00:57:20,884
but he's actually so kind.

1123
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:22,854
Mr Oh had Jang Geu Rae's back in the drama, "Misaeng".

1124
00:57:22,854 --> 00:57:24,954
You're like Mr Oh to this No Geu Rae here.

1125
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:27,554
What kind of coffee do you want? Something stylish like you?

1126
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:29,724
Or would you like something as sweet as you, like caffe latte?

1127
00:57:29,724 --> 00:57:30,824
Anything would be fine.

1128
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:32,954
Okay! I have a lot of potentials, so I'll be right back with a good one.

1129
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:35,524
Hearing that she has potentials got her all excited.

1130
00:57:35,754 --> 00:57:36,924
I think I'm pregnant.

1131
00:57:36,924 --> 00:57:38,354
What? Oh, no!

1132
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,554
What are you talking about? I'm so happy about it.

1133
00:57:40,684 --> 00:57:41,684
What are you doing?

1134
00:57:41,954 --> 00:57:43,654
Mr Kim, you must be tired.

1135
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:45,024
You. You over there.

1136
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:46,624
"Go to Mojito and drink a glass of the Maldives."

1137
00:57:47,584 --> 00:57:48,724
Have some manners.

1138
00:57:48,824 --> 00:57:50,084
I set my eyes on it first.

1139
00:57:50,084 --> 00:57:51,654
I grabbed it first.

1140
00:57:51,754 --> 00:57:52,754
You little...

1141
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:54,854
You can have this. You know that it's my favourite shirt, right?

1142
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:57,184
- Ki Bum, let me give you a hug. - What is wrong with you, seriously?

1143
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,484
Dong Young, don't die.

1144
00:57:58,484 --> 00:58:00,154
Please be alive.

1145
00:58:00,154 --> 00:58:01,424
Dong Young...

1146
00:58:01,954 --> 00:58:02,954
Is that Professor Park?

1147
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:04,784
Professor Park, are you okay?

1148
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:06,824
I saw you bumping into the box earlier and got worried.

1149
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,284
I shall introduce a nice guy to you.

1150
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:09,524
What? You're not here alone?

1151
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:10,784
Hello, I'm Jin Gong Myung.

1152
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:12,484
Let's start dating.

1153
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,924
- Drink with me. - No, thank you. Ms No Geu Rae.

1154
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,024
I heard everything.

1155
00:58:16,024 --> 00:58:17,724
So I got in the joint class as a substitute.

1156
00:58:17,824 --> 00:58:18,924
What are you doing now?

1157
00:58:18,924 --> 00:58:20,654
What? You let me get in because of my potentials?

1158
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:21,924
Why did you lie to my face? Why?

1159
00:58:22,024 --> 00:58:23,784
You're seriously so obnoxious.

1160
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:25,054
What did you just say?
