00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,351
<i>[Episode 14]</i>

3
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,099
Geez, you surprised me!

4
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,900
What are you doing here?
You scared me!

5
00:02:12,694 --> 00:02:14,700
Why are you drinking?
You should study instead!

6
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,499
If you're not going to study,
wash up and go to bed!

7
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,700
Man, what a shock.

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,499
<i>Did you get home okay?</i>

9
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,099
Did you get a girlfriend, Big Bro?

10
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
What?

11
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:35,999
You just look like
you're in a good mood.

12
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,599
So I was wondering if you
got a girlfriend or something.

13
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,499
Yeah. I did get a girlfriend.

14
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,999
Who is it?

15
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,200
What?

16
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,499
Who's your girlfriend?

17
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,400
You don't need to know.

18
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,700
Stop thinking about nonsense
and focus on studying.

19
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,999
He's stupid when it comes to
studying, but he sure is perceptive.

20
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,999
<i>Should I just tell him the truth?</i>

21
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:22,200
<i>No, they're just fleeting
unrequited feelings anyway</i>

22
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
<i>and he'll probably get over her
on his own soon enough.</i>

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,700
<i>There's no need for
me to get involved.</i>

24
00:03:27,193 --> 00:03:29,400
<i>I don't want all of this
to become a huge headache.</i>

25
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,999
The person who'll become my
girlfriend is Professor Park Ha Na.

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,000
Well, it's only unrequited
love for now, though.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm going to start dating her
after I pass the exam for sure.

28
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,799
Uurequited love?

29
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,900
If you have time to be thinking about
nonsense like that, study more.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
He knew exactly how
I felt about her...

31
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
and yet he was doing that
behind my back?

32
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, Gong Myung?

33
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,700
<i>What are you doing?
Let's have a drink together.</i>

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,400
<i>Oh, we can just
drink that together.</i>

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
What?

36
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,599
What's with you?
Why are you drinking alone?

37
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why else? It's because he's miserable
over Jung Chae Yeon, of course.

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
Because of Master?

39
00:04:58,808 --> 00:04:59,808
Why?

40
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,200
Answer me!
Do you like Jin Gong Myung?

41
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,099
Yeah, I do.
Why do you care?

42
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,400
What is it?
Why do you feel miserable?

43
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,799
You don't need to know.

44
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,700
There's just something, all right?

45
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, don't pry any further than that.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,700
There's just something with him.

47
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,299
Hey, what's with you?

48
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,299
Things between Joo Yeon
and me are totally over.

49
00:05:36,299 --> 00:05:37,299
What?

50
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:41,400
Why? I thought you two would get
back together after you passed.

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
What do you mean,
what am I talking about?

52
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,700
I'm saying that Joo Yeon
got herself a boyfriend!

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,299
Hey, it's only been two months
since we broke up, okay?

54
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,400
And yet you're already
seeing another guy?

55
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,000
<i>I don't have a boyfriend, all right?</i>

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,799
<i>I thought you'd be studying
hard after we broke up</i>.

57
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,299
<i>You've been snooping around
on my social media site?</i>

58
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:58,900
<i>Don't call me again.</i>

59
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,400
<i>We're over.</i>

60
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,400
Hey! I asked you why
you two are really over now!

61
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,200
Yeah, um, don't pry.

62
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,799
He has his own circumstances too.

63
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,400
What's with all three of us today?

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,799
What do you mean
all three of us?

65
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't think that
I have a shot with Professor Park.

66
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,099
She got herself a boyfriend.

67
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
Geez.

68
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,000
What's with all of us today?

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,500
But... why'd you leave your house?

70
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,000
What? You left your house, man?

71
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
Why?

72
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,400
Don't pry.

73
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Something just happened.

74
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,700
So let me sleep over at your place.

75
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,099
You room is bigger than
this guy's, after all.

76
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,200
No.

77
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,299
How could you even ask...

78
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,099
You can't sleep in my room tonight!

79
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
What's with him?

80
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Hey, what did he mean by that?

81
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
He has his own circumstances.

82
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go to my room.

83
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,500
Where'd you put the TV remote--

84
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,299
Huh? Where did he go off to?

85
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,500
Looks like he ran out since
it's the weekend tomorrow.

86
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,699
I ought to rip him a new one.

87
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:59,058
<i>[No Geu Rae]</i>

88
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:01,699
Yes, Ms. No Geu Rae?

89
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,500
Yes. The weather
nowadays is so nice.

90
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,199
How about we walk
near the Han River tomorrow?

91
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,199
Yes, let's do that.

92
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,900
And how about we get lunch
at Kyungridan-gil?

93
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
Yes! What should we eat?

94
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Anything is fine with me
as long as I'm eating with you!

95
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,699
Then what should
we do after lunch?

96
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:30,100
I'm fine with anything
as long as it's with you!

97
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Me too. I'm fine with anything!

98
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes, see you tomorrow, then. Yes.

99
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Oh wow, did you have a party, Miss?

100
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,600
Looks like you had
tons of people over!

101
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,900
Huh? Oh... yes.

102
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Man, I need to cut
back on my drinking.

103
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,799
Oh, is that Professor Jin?

104
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,699
No way. We talked on
the phone for so long too!

105
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,699
<i>Let's all go hiking as a team-building
activity since it's been a while.</i>

106
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,699
<i>Okay, buddies?</i>

107
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,299
What? Why hiking?

108
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,100
I want to rest tomorrow!

109
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:40,900
Why hiking?
Damn it!

110
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,199
But he'll be really peeved
if I don't show up.

111
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,000
<i>Wow! I'd love to go hiking! Whoo!</i>

112
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,000
<i>I'm fine with hiking.</i>

113
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,199
<i>I was feeling depressed,
so I should get some air anyway.</i>

114
00:09:56,699 --> 00:09:59,900
What? It looks like
everyone is going!

115
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,895
Oh well, it can't be helped.

116
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,500
This is my first weekend date
with Professor Jin after all.

117
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,199
<i>I have important plans
tomorrow, so--</i>

118
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,799
<i>Why aren't you responding,
Professor Park?</i>

119
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,500
<i>You're not going to say that you have
important plans and not come, are you?</i>

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,400
<i>I really hate it when people try to
wiggle their way out of group stuff.</i>

121
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,299
<i>Let's go together, Ha Na.
I'm so depressed.</i>

122
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,600
<i>Of course she'll come
since all her seniors are coming.</i>

123
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Are you serious?

124
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,699
Damn it!

125
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,600
<i>Yes, of course I'll come...</i>

126
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,215
Damn it!

127
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,602
Wait. How come Professor
Jin isn't in this group chat?

128
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,000
Maybe he forgot to include him?

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,100
Then I could call Professor Jin over
and have ourselves a secret date!

130
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:00,900
<i>Um, Director. I think that you left
Professor Jin out of the group chat.</i>

131
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,400
<i>Should I invite him in?</i>

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,600
<i>Let him be!</i>

133
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,699
<i>I didn't include that asshole in the
chat since he hates group activities!</i>

134
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,100
Damn it!

135
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,299
<i>Oh, I see. You're doing him a favor
because you think he'd hate to come.</i>

136
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:21,400
<i>No, it's not because I thought he'd
hate to come. It's because I hate him.</i>

137
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,000
<i>After eating with him that one time,
it's clear that he's super picky</i>

138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,699
<i>and just does whatever
the hell he wants.</i>

139
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,600
<i>It pisses me off so, so much
to be anywhere near him.</i>

140
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,400
<i>Yeah, there's no need to tell Premium
Trash! It'll just inconvenience everyone!</i>

141
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,699
<i>Looks like we'll do lots of team-building
by bonding over our hate for him.</i>

142
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,000
<i>Mwahahahaha!</i>

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,199
What's with everyone?

144
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,900
Geez! Ugh!

145
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,699
<i>Professor Park, pack
some snacks for us.</i>

146
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,400
<i>Have a light heart
and a heavy pack! Got that?</i>

147
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,911
Ugh, seriously?

148
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,000
Hiking?

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes. The director wants us all
to go as a team-building activity.

150
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,699
Just refuse and say you
had prior engagements.

151
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:01,500
And tell them that
it's really important.

152
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,400
I want to do that too, but I'm
not a top lecturer like you are.

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,000
And I'm not in a position where
I could just straight-up refuse them.

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,600
I can't believe he's taking
your weekend now too.

155
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,068
What a ridiculous director!

156
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,299
He should go hiking by himself if
he wants to go! Team-building, my foot.

157
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:22,699
Wait. You said that this
was for team-building, right?

158
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:24,900
But he didn't tell me
anything about it.

159
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,699
Um, well, that is...

160
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:31,900
He probably didn't
contact you out of respect

161
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,400
since he knows how much
you hate group activities.

162
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,600
No. It's obvious that
he's just leaving me out.

163
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
Well, at any rate, I'm really sorry.

164
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
All right. Have fun then,
Ms. No Geu Rae.

165
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,500
What the hell!

166
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,299
Man, I even planned my outfit
for tomorrow's date too!

167
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,100
I hate being forced into
lackluster situations such as these!

168
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,900
Joo... Yeon.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,100
It's just a misunderstanding,
Joo Yeon.

170
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:08,699
Joo Yeon.

171
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,699
<i>If Jin Gong Myung passes
the civil servant exam</i>

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:22,500
<i>I, Park Ha Na, will seriously
consider dating him.</i>

173
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,699
<i>[Delete]</i>

174
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,285
<i>[Delete one audio recording file?]</i>

175
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,299
Um, I thought you wanted to hike.
Why are you dressed like that?

176
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,999
Oh, I lied to my family and said there
was an important meeting I had to go to.

177
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,999
- What?
- What?

178
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:31,199
I mean, it's kimchi-making
day at my house today!

179
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,499
You know how I almost broke my back
making 200 cabbages' worth of kimchi

180
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,699
while listening to my mother-in-law's
never-ending nagging last year, right?

181
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:39,800
I don't even eat that kimchi anyway
because it's too damn salty.

182
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,300
I really don't want to do it.

183
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,400
So I told a little white lie this time.

184
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:48,100
But will you be okay hiking
in those clothes, Director?

185
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,999
Director! How about we scrap this idea
and just lie around all day?

186
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,499
That's not a bad idea.

187
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:59,100
Oh my gosh.

188
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,699
I cannot allow this.

189
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,900
This person... is mine.

190
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
- What are you doing now?
- What are you saying?

191
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,699
And why are you wearing
your hat like that?

192
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,199
You're impersonating Park Bo Gum from
"Moonlight Drawn By Clouds," right?

193
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,499
Yep!

194
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:12,900
Here, look.

195
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,800
<i>I cannot allow this.</i>

196
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,699
<i>Your Highness.</i>

197
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,400
<i>This person is mine.</i>

198
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,699
Well? How was it?
It was the same, right?

199
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:34,999
Oh, whatever!

200
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:37,999
Why are you impersonating Park Bo Gum,
of all people, with a face like that?

201
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:39,699
Ha Na.
That annoyed you too, right?

202
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:40,900
Say something.

203
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
- What?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,100
I cannot allow it.

205
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,199
Professor Min.

206
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,699
This person is mine.

207
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,400
What are you doing?

208
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,699
I thought you said you didn't do
impersonations on your days off.

209
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm going to do this at my lecture
tomorrow, so I thought I'd practice

210
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
and see how people react to it.

211
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,900
Whatever. Anyway, you brought
me spare clothes, right?

212
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,100
Hand them over.

213
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,900
I'll go get changed.

214
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,699
- Yes, see you soon.
- Yeah.

215
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:54,400
Why are you all taking a break already?
We haven't even gone that far yet!

216
00:18:55,298 --> 00:18:58,100
Oh, hello!

217
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,998
Um, what... what brings you here?

218
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:06,998
What do you mean?
I'm here to hike, of course.

219
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:09,900
I often hike around here
on weekends.

220
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,199
O-oh! I see, I see!

221
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,199
Yeah, this is a nice trail. Yes.

222
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,298
Yeah, um, we just, um, all happened
to run into each other here.

223
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:20,998
Yeah, right up there!

224
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,699
What an amazing coincidence, right?

225
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:24,699
Yes!

226
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:28,600
Yes. One would even think that you left
just me out and planned all this.

227
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, of course we wouldn't!

228
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,600
How could we come hiking and leave
you, the star of our academy, out?

229
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,298
All right.
Be on your way, then.

230
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:43,199
I'm sure you don't want
to hike with us anyway.

231
00:19:43,199 --> 00:19:46,400
No, no. Let's hike up together,
since we met up here.

232
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,699
- Huh?
- What? Why?

233
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:48,699
Why?

234
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:51,100
What, I can't hike with you all?

235
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Of course you can't...
not come with us.

236
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,298
Of course you can come.
Um, yeah.

237
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:59,699
Um, okay, then.
Let's go together.

238
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:00,998
Sure.

239
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:08,400
Damn that asshole.
Why is he here?

240
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:11,998
Let's go, sir!

241
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,298
What's going on?

242
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,900
What do you mean?
I came to see my girlfriend.

243
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,100
What?

244
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,600
Ha Na! Hurry!

245
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,998
Oh, okay!

246
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,199
Ugh, damn it!
These pants are too long!

247
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,998
I just want to cut
this part right off!

248
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:05,199
I will not allow that.

249
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,400
Those are my pants.

250
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,400
What are you doing? Stop it with
that gaze that you can't even pull off!

251
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,998
I cannot allow that.

252
00:21:14,699 --> 00:21:16,400
It's my gaze.

253
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:20,699
Geez. Ugh!

254
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,998
Why did Premium Trash
insist on coming with us?

255
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:37,998
Damn it!

256
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:40,600
I feel so uncomfortable around him
because he rejected me at the club.

257
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,400
No, I shouldn't complain.

258
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,498
You got left behind on a bridge
over the Han River after all.

259
00:21:48,498 --> 00:21:49,798
Um, yes.

260
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:51,199
Don't worry about me, Ha Na.

261
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:54,798
Let's forget about Asshole Min Ho
and Jin Jung Seok

262
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:57,100
and have fun lives
as single women.

263
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Okay?

264
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:03,400
Wow, look at the fall foliage!
It's so pretty!

265
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:05,699
Oh wow!

266
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:08,298
<i>Should I just tell her the truth?</i>

267
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:11,998
<i>No, she came here to make
herself feel better.</i>

268
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,298
<i>And this will just make
her more depressed.</i>

269
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,498
<i>I'll tell her about me and
Professor Jin when she feels better.</i>

270
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,900
It looks like you're hungry.
Go and eat with Ki Bum.

271
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,699
I have no appetite.

272
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:38,400
No. There's no use of
eating in this state.

273
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,699
I'm sure that Ki Bum has no appetite
either since he's miserable too.

274
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,100
- Ugh!
- Come on!

275
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,498
What are you doing?

276
00:22:50,498 --> 00:22:52,400
What else, you bastards?

277
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,298
Why are you still lounging around?
Do you know what time it is?

278
00:22:54,298 --> 00:22:56,498
Let's go out.
I'll buy you guys hangover soup.

279
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:00,298
You looked just like the male protagonist
of a melodrama yesterday

280
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:03,699
but you totally did a 180 overnight.

281
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:06,998
Yeah.
Are you crazy?

282
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:09,100
I heard that your hopes for being
with Master are all gone now!

283
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
So what?

284
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,100
I can just find a girl who's much
prettier and much nicer than she is.

285
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,699
So forget about Professor Park, okay?

286
00:23:15,699 --> 00:23:17,298
Let's be real.
She's way too old anyway.

287
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,498
And you forget about
Hwang Joo Yeon too.

288
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,199
You really still want to be with her
when she dumped you?

289
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,400
- What?
- What?

290
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,699
What I'm saying is there's
plenty of fish in the sea!

291
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,998
So don't be all depressed
and let's hurry and go out.

292
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,699
Did you even really love
Jung Chae Yeon?

293
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah. To think that I was so worried
about your stupid lighthearted love.

294
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,998
Whatever, man!
Let's go out already!

295
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:37,100
- No thanks.
- No thanks.

296
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,699
This won't do.

297
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:43,998
If you don't leave this room
by the time I count to 10

298
00:23:43,998 --> 00:23:45,998
I'll call the manager.

299
00:23:45,998 --> 00:23:48,400
You know that there's
a no-guest policy here, right?

300
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
10.

301
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Nine.

302
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,900
- Eight.
- Let's hurry and go.

303
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
- Seven. Six.
- Come on.

304
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,498
- Five. Four.
- All right, man! Give me a minute!

305
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:58,400
- Three.
- Okay, already!

306
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
We're going!
We're going!

307
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,900
- All right!
- Two! One! To the manager!

308
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,699
- Get out, please! Get out!
- All right, already!

309
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Oh my gosh!

310
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,998
Why is your bag so heavy?

311
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,400
The director told me
to bring the snacks.

312
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,699
Geez. Does he not have hands?

313
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:27,100
And I see him using his hands
so, so well, all the time, like this!

314
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,699
Give me your bag.

315
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:31,298
Oh, it's okay.
What if someone sees?

316
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:34,298
Everyone else went ahead already.
Nobody will see.

317
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,699
Here, give that to me.

318
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
Why aren't you coming, Ha Na?

319
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:45,298
What are you doing with
Ha Na's bag, Professor Jin?

320
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:47,699
Oh, um, Jin Yi.
The thing is...

321
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,298
I wanted to see what
brand the bag was from.

322
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:50,498
The brand?

323
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:53,199
It looked familiar,
so I just had to look.

324
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:56,498
But it's just a cheap knockoff,
just as I expected.

325
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,498
Wow, that Premium Trash!

326
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:08,400
Now he's even looking down
on my bag of all things?

327
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,699
Unbelievable.
Ugh! That trash.

328
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:15,600
What was that?

329
00:25:22,699 --> 00:25:23,900
Hey.

330
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:26,100
Here, have this.

331
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,600
Eat with some gusto,
you bastards!

332
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,900
Here.

333
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,600
No, you eat.

334
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,400
Just eat when I'm actually
offering you food, man!

335
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:38,900
Geez.

336
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,699
- Hey, want to go see a baseball game?
- Why?

337
00:25:45,699 --> 00:25:47,998
It's the bestfor making
you feel be ter!

338
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:51,900
Man, it's been three years since I've
been to a game because I was stuck here!

339
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,998
And yet you do everything
else that you want to do.

340
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:54,298
You didn't go to any baseball games?

341
00:25:54,298 --> 00:25:55,798
Hey.

342
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:57,699
People may call me
a lounging good-for-nothing

343
00:25:57,699 --> 00:26:00,298
but there is one rule that
I always follow.

344
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:04,699
I can never leave Noryangjin to play.

345
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:08,998
And I can never go on blind dates
even if I'm interested in the girl.

346
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,298
I do have some morals too, you know.

347
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,498
- Whatever.
- Anyway!

348
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:14,199
Let's go and cheer up!

349
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:15,400
Shut it. We don't even have
the money for that.

350
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,699
We may not have money,
but I have my mom's credit card.

351
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:23,900
Here. Ta-da!

352
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Let's go.
Let's go.

353
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Wow.

354
00:26:32,498 --> 00:26:34,100
Take my hand.

355
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,498
Oh, it's okay.
What if someone sees us again?

356
00:26:37,498 --> 00:26:41,900
Who cares? Didn't you see
my top-quality acting before?

357
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,699
I can explain my way out of any
situation, so hurry and take my hand.

358
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,798
Ha Na!
Let's go together!

359
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:51,798
Wait up!

360
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:02,900
Oh, Ms. No Geu Rae!

361
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,699
- What was that?
- Are you all right?

362
00:27:07,498 --> 00:27:09,199
Help me up too, Professor Jin!

363
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,798
- Are you all right?
- Ow!

364
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,199
- I think so.
- Try moving your leg.

365
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,699
- Ow!
- I'm okay.

366
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:18,498
Oh yeah. Jin Yi!

367
00:27:18,498 --> 00:27:19,798
Are you okay?
I'm sorry!

368
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,699
What was that, Professor Jin?

369
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:28,998
How come you helped her up,
but you didn't help me?

370
00:27:28,998 --> 00:27:31,498
Am I not human?
Am I just an animal?

371
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:36,100
Well, you were definitely acting
the part at the club yesterday.

372
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
What did you just say?

373
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,798
I told you yesterday.

374
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,199
Don't act like you know
me outside of work.

375
00:27:41,199 --> 00:27:45,400
I don't want to exchange words with
a low-quality individual like yourself.

376
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,699
Man, this got everywhere!
I'm going to the bathroom for a bit.

377
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:53,900
Oh, okay.

378
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,498
What's with him?

379
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,900
Geez, Park Ha Na.
You left something behind again!

380
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,600
Ha Na!

381
00:28:15,298 --> 00:28:18,998
<i>Ditch that stupid Professor Hwang
and meet me at the rest stop.</i>

382
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:22,498
<i>Don't get too close with her.
She's such a low-quality woman.</i>

383
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:23,699
What is this?

384
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:31,699
<i>I'm going on the hike now.
I'm sad that I can't see you.</i>

385
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:36,199
<i>I'm more upset than you are.
Well, anyway, have fun.</i>

386
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:37,699
<i>Okay!</i>

387
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:45,498
Wait a second...
are these two dating?

388
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:55,600
<i>I love you.</i>

389
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:02,400
<i>I love you more.</i>

390
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,400
Why, these little... ugh!

391
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:15,100
Oh, Jin Yi!

392
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,199
Oh.

393
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,298
Hey, Park Ha Na.

394
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:22,100
Are you dating Premium Trash?

395
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:36,699
Jin Yi.

396
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:43,900
So he didn't come here by chance.
He came here to see you! Right?

397
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,900
Wow, this is hilarious.
This is so funny!

398
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Then, yesterday, at the club

399
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,699
he came to see you then, too?

400
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:56,498
And yet I was going on about
how I was going to seduce him!

401
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:59,699
You two were making
a laughingstock of me, weren't you?

402
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:05,699
It must have been so funny
for you to watch me, wasn't it?

403
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,998
No, that's not it. I...

404
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:10,498
No, this is so, so funny.

405
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:13,199
I thought it'd really be
a while until I smiled again

406
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,100
after breaking up with
that asshole Min Ho.

407
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,400
But thanks to you, I had a real laugh!

408
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,298
Thanks. Really.

409
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:22,699
Please don't be mad, Jin Yi.

410
00:30:22,699 --> 00:30:26,998
I just couldn't tell you because I didn't
want to make you more depressed.

411
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:29,400
Yeah, I totally understand
how you must have felt.

412
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,699
Of course.

413
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,699
See how I'm laughing? See?

414
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,400
Thank you for understanding.

415
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,699
Also, I know that this is shameless of me
to ask, but can you keep this a secret?

416
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,900
Of course. It's not like anyone
would believe me anyway!

417
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,798
Premium Trash, who said
he'd only date someone

418
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:50,298
with supermodel looks and
who graduated from Seoul University

419
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,298
likes someone like you,
of all people!

420
00:30:52,298 --> 00:30:53,900
Who'd believe that? Right?

421
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,298
Oh my! What a riot!

422
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,498
Hey, hurry over to the rest stop
and spend some nice-ass time with him.

423
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,798
I, a low-quality woman

424
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,477
I, who's like an animal

425
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:18,498
will hold back my tears
and climb the crap out of this hill!

426
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:23,400
Wow, this is so, so funny.
Unbelievable. Crazy.

427
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,699
- Wow!
- Jin Yi!

428
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,100
Damn it!

429
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:35,400
You bastards. The game is going
badly because of you downers!

430
00:32:36,498 --> 00:32:37,699
Here.

431
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:43,699
You have to put these on
your heads so that they'll win!

432
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:55,900
- Go team!
- Go team!

433
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,600
- Go team!
- Go team!

434
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,298
Whoa!

435
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,600
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

436
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

437
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,499
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

438
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:51,700
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

439
00:33:58,099 --> 00:34:00,400
<i>[Calling Jin Gong Myung]</i>

440
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,298
What the hell,
Jin Gong Myung?

441
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,206
<i>Let's study together on the computer.
Log in now.</i>

442
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:14,394
<i>Jin Gong Myung, are you still asleep?</i>

443
00:34:14,394 --> 00:34:17,037
<i>Jin Gong Myung, how come
you're not responding?</i>

444
00:34:17,037 --> 00:34:19,724
<i>If you do this, I won't study
with you on the computer.</i>

445
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,896
He hasn't even read it yet.

446
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,952
<i>Your call is being redirected...</i>

447
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:30,789
What is really going on?

448
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:33,619
He was so determined until yesterday.

449
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:36,800
Did something happen?

450
00:34:43,095 --> 00:34:45,166
What's up with the triangle kimbap?

451
00:34:45,523 --> 00:34:47,818
I didn't have breakfast
this morning, so I got hungry.

452
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,231
- Do you want to have some?
- No thanks.

453
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:53,153
My feet are sweating so much.

454
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,269
Take good care of yourself, okay?

455
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:01,977
Or find a woman who will do that for you.

456
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,731
Why would such a woman go out with me?

457
00:35:03,731 --> 00:35:05,662
I'm a divorced man
who doesn't make much money.

458
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:08,965
You should meet a woman
who is dying to get married then.

459
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,131
There she is.

460
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,557
What? Professor Hwang?

461
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:20,244
Why not?

462
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,494
Professor Hwang is dying to get married.

463
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:26,702
She just happened to
break up with her boyfriend.

464
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:29,050
This is the perfect time.
You should be forward.

465
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,918
Would Professor Hwang even consider me?

466
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:37,057
You're not saying you don't want that.

467
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:39,394
- I guess you like the idea, huh?
- What?

468
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,396
That's not what I'm saying.
She's not my type...

469
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,416
Now is your chance.

470
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,936
- I will support you two.
- What?

471
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:50,336
When a woman and man go hiking together

472
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:52,503
they will fall in love without a doubt.

473
00:35:52,503 --> 00:35:53,927
No doubt.

474
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:56,731
I also fell in love with my wife
while hiking Mt. Seorak.

475
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,729
- Did you really?
- I'm saying you will.

476
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:02,240
That's why I don't even pee
in the direction of Mt. Seorak.

477
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,434
Because I hate it.

478
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:09,180
Anyway, it works.

479
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,463
I will support you all the way.

480
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,780
I won't allow it.
It's my private love life.

481
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,175
I won't allow it. It's up to me.

482
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:22,952
Director Kim. Director Kim!

483
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,164
What was that about?

484
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,983
- What? You want us to bet?
- Yes.

485
00:36:29,983 --> 00:36:32,704
Let's divide into teams
and see who gets to the top first.

486
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,001
Whoever loses will pay
for drinks tonight.

487
00:36:34,001 --> 00:36:36,030
No thanks. That's cheesy.

488
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,910
Come on, it will be fun.

489
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,135
The youngest and oldest,
Professor Park and I, will be one team.

490
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,521
Professors Hwang and Min
are the same team.

491
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,867
- Why are you leaving me out?
- What?

492
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,485
Do you want to bet too?

493
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:52,979
You won't come to drink
with us anyway. What for?

494
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:54,704
Well, I will go then.

495
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:57,155
What? Professor Jin is going
to have drinks with us?

496
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:58,418
How did that happen?

497
00:36:58,418 --> 00:36:59,856
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

498
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:02,655
So you will be the judge.

499
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:04,992
No Geu Rae and I will be a team.

500
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:08,278
Wow, you're acting really weird today.

501
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:11,059
- Are you seriously going to bet?
- Yes.

502
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,760
It looks like it's very clear
who is going to win.

503
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,778
I always bet on something
I will definitely win.

504
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:20,514
- A bet you will definitely win?
- You seem good at hiking, huh?

505
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:22,753
No matter how good you are at hiking

506
00:37:22,753 --> 00:37:24,260
are you as good as this wild animal?

507
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,724
But you're still an animal
no matter what.

508
00:37:25,724 --> 00:37:27,229
When it comes to hiking

509
00:37:27,229 --> 00:37:31,729
you need a strategy such as knowing
geography and controlling your pace.

510
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,952
Director Kim, let's start, shall we?

511
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:37,102
Good then.
Whoever reaches the top first

512
00:37:37,102 --> 00:37:40,153
take a photo next to the rock on top
and post it on our chat room.

513
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,648
Then it will be counted as a win.

514
00:37:41,648 --> 00:37:46,160
So let's hike to the top now.

515
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,503
Ready, set, go!

516
00:37:47,503 --> 00:37:50,104
Next team, set, go!

517
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:56,180
They look better together
than I expected.

518
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,689
I wish them all the best.

519
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,811
No Geu Rae, let me carry your backpack.

520
00:38:08,811 --> 00:38:10,273
No, it's okay.

521
00:38:10,273 --> 00:38:13,356
Give it. We're on the same team,
so no one will suspect anything.

522
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,905
We should win this bet
since we're doing it.

523
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:26,423
- Hold my hand.
- What? It's okay.

524
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:28,684
We should win this bet
since we're doing it.

525
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:37,017
Professor Jin, are you really
coming to drink with us?

526
00:38:38,206 --> 00:38:42,414
Since my girlfriend can't miss it,
I should be there for her.

527
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:46,831
That's why you're doing this bet.

528
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,302
I wasn't reluctant.

529
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,907
Actually, I was glad to have this bet.

530
00:38:51,907 --> 00:38:55,039
Now I can be with you openly
thanks to it.

531
00:38:57,845 --> 00:39:01,086
Hurry up. Hurry!

532
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,501
We have to beat that team.

533
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,555
Move out of the way. Hurry.
What kind of man are you?

534
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,914
She's a wild animal.

535
00:39:15,423 --> 00:39:18,146
I will make sure he pays a lot
for the drinks tonight.

536
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:21,343
I will make him spend
all his money and cry.

537
00:39:21,343 --> 00:39:23,195
Professor Hwang, wait up for me.

538
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:25,972
Hurry up, will you?

539
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:28,903
We're winning. Let's take a quick break.

540
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:30,235
I'm so tired now.

541
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:34,189
No, hurry. Seriously.

542
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:36,559
You want to push me? You don't have to.

543
00:39:37,874 --> 00:39:40,392
- Climb up now.
- What are you doing?

544
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:41,979
If you don't hurry, I will stick this in.

545
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:45,595
- I will give you a wedgie.
- I won't allow it. It's my butt.

546
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:47,280
It's not a good time to be impersonating.

547
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,954
They've almost caught up with us.

548
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,771
- Hurry up. Hurry.
- Okay, okay.

549
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,430
- Okay, okay.
- Hurry up.

550
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,764
Okay.

551
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:58,827
Professor Hwang, gosh.

552
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:02,644
Are you okay?

553
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:07,959
- I can't.
- You can't, right?

554
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,269
Let's drop out of the race.

555
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,664
Carry me on your back now.

556
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,925
- What?
- Carry me on your back.

557
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:20,519
I shouldn't be carrying anybody
on my back at the moment.

558
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,443
- Carry me on your back!
- I'm still mourning, you know!

559
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:26,684
- Hurry up. Hurry.
- Okay, I got it.

560
00:40:26,684 --> 00:40:29,941
Hurry up! Hurry!

561
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:32,675
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Okay! I got it!

562
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,506
Hurry! Hurry!

563
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:42,376
Don't do that.

564
00:40:42,376 --> 00:40:43,858
Easy! Easy! I got it!

565
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:52,834
Where are you guys going?
Hurry! Hurry!

566
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,450
Wow, we won!

567
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:09,499
I almost forgot.
We should take a photo to prove it.

568
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:10,535
A photo to prove it.

569
00:41:11,604 --> 00:41:13,787
- I'm beat.
- Gosh, seriously!

570
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:17,867
One, two, three.

571
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:22,735
What was that? What kind of man are you?

572
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:25,965
Now I know why your wife divorced you.

573
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:28,539
- What did you say?
- Gosh, it sucks!

574
00:41:29,764 --> 00:41:31,383
Gosh, it sucks!

575
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:36,872
Gosh, what about you?

576
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,079
Now I can see why you were dumped!

577
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,035
You will live alone
for the rest of your life!

578
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:47,193
It's been three years
since I went to a baseball game.

579
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:48,693
And we saw a home run.

580
00:41:48,693 --> 00:41:50,336
It was a jackpot.

581
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,925
Agreed. It was my first time
seeing a home run.

582
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:56,072
I also thought it was amazing.

583
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:58,405
Guys.

584
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:00,463
The team hit a home run and won the game.

585
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:03,300
Why still the long faces, huh?

586
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,684
Snap out of it
and let's go get some cold beer.

587
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:10,537
It will be my treat tonight.

588
00:42:12,742 --> 00:42:14,735
Can you hold these for a sec?

589
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:20,146
- What's up, Mom?
- <i>What's up?</i>

590
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:21,334
<i>You punk.</i>

591
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:24,700
<i>I just got a text about the charges
for baseball tickets, chicken, and beer.</i>

592
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,760
<i>What is all this?</i>

593
00:42:26,057 --> 00:42:29,164
It was about me relieving stress.

594
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:30,981
<i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

595
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,204
<i>I let it go when you go out
and drink every day.</i>

596
00:42:33,204 --> 00:42:35,061
<i>Now you're killing time
at a baseball stadium?</i>

597
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:37,526
It's been three years.

598
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:39,947
Please have a heart, please...

599
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:43,418
What? Already?

600
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:45,394
How could you freeze the credit card
without telling me first?

601
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:46,552
How am I supposed to get by?

602
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,479
Mom... Mom, Mom. Mom!

603
00:42:52,012 --> 00:42:54,789
I thought you were going overboard today.

604
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:56,483
Let's go to a convenience store for beer.

605
00:42:56,483 --> 00:42:58,570
I should still have 20,000 won
for my allowance.

606
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,724
How could we have beer at a convenience
store on a day like today?

607
00:43:04,108 --> 00:43:06,363
When there is a will, there is a way.

608
00:43:06,363 --> 00:43:07,814
Follow me.

609
00:43:09,068 --> 00:43:11,680
- Where are you going?
- Wait up.

610
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,602
<i>[38th Alumni Association]</i>

611
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:22,293
How can we be here pretending
we went to the same school?

612
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:23,378
What if we get caught?

613
00:43:23,378 --> 00:43:25,584
Why would we get caught?

614
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,930
How can anyone tell
when there are so many people?

615
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:31,146
- But still... let's leave.
- Gosh, shut it.

616
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:33,526
You can't speak like a Seoulite in here.

617
00:43:33,526 --> 00:43:36,385
Just shut it and eat.

618
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:44,818
Guys, let's drink.

619
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:46,099
Sure.

620
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,831
By the way, you guys don't look familiar.

621
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:55,477
It's your first time
at the gathering, huh?

622
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,789
Let me pour you one.

623
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:02,356
But I didn't see you
when I was in school either.

624
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:03,896
Which class were you in?

625
00:44:03,896 --> 00:44:07,244
- Three.
- Were you? I was in that class too.

626
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:10,204
But I still don't remember you.

627
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:13,247
I was in class two, next to class three.
I was confused.

628
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:16,186
Were you? I was in class two too.

629
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,878
But I don't know who you are.

630
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:19,126
What's your name?

631
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:22,733
Oh my, I was in class one,
next to class two.

632
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:25,876
Were you? I was in class one.

633
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,637
I don't remember you.

634
00:44:27,637 --> 00:44:28,800
What's your name?

635
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:32,735
Tell us.

636
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:35,215
What is your name?

637
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,365
Are you sure you guys went to our school?

638
00:44:39,622 --> 00:44:43,233
Say it. Say it!

639
00:44:43,233 --> 00:44:44,863
Who are you?

640
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:48,126
You punk, where is the president?

641
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:49,713
Bring your president.

642
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:54,867
Your president lives in
Namchang-dong, right?

643
00:44:54,867 --> 00:45:00,175
I'd go out for snacks
with your president, you know.

644
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:02,733
We'd go to a sauna together, huh?

645
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,385
We did everything together, okay?

646
00:45:06,452 --> 00:45:07,666
I'm the president.

647
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:12,561
And I lived in Gaeshin-dong,
not Namchan-dong.

648
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:18,108
We're sorry. We didn't eat
more than 10,000 won worth.

649
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:21,340
What are you still doing here? Run!

650
00:47:22,432 --> 00:47:24,244
You all did a good job today.

651
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:26,532
Drink this and recharge.

652
00:47:26,532 --> 00:47:28,731
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

653
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:31,914
Cheers.

654
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:42,465
I feel like I'm getting recharged.

655
00:47:42,465 --> 00:47:44,432
My muscles are pumping up and all.

656
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,639
Pumping up? You wish.

657
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,700
You were so weak.

658
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,421
You were like the walking dead earlier.

659
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:55,251
What? How can you say that?

660
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:56,939
Shut it and just drink.

661
00:48:00,374 --> 00:48:02,581
I won't allow it. It's my mouth.

662
00:48:02,581 --> 00:48:05,856
I can say whatever I want
with my own mouth.

663
00:48:05,856 --> 00:48:07,436
- How dare you!
- Stop it.

664
00:48:07,436 --> 00:48:09,006
You two stop.

665
00:48:10,892 --> 00:48:14,405
I'm still not sure if this is
a dream or real, Professor Jin.

666
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:17,202
I wonder what changed your mind.

667
00:48:17,202 --> 00:48:19,273
You're doing a lot of things
you wouldn't do before.

668
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,796
You came out to lunch with us.

669
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:22,249
You went hiking with us too.

670
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:23,818
You joined us for drinking like this.

671
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,805
You always wanted to
promote our friendship.

672
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:30,354
I'm here to promote our friendship,
as you wish.

673
00:48:30,354 --> 00:48:32,204
Are you sure?

674
00:48:32,204 --> 00:48:33,934
You don't have any other reason?

675
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:38,947
- Any other reason?
- I have no idea.

676
00:48:38,947 --> 00:48:40,465
Just drink.

677
00:48:48,702 --> 00:48:52,436
Wow, Professor Jin
knows how to drink this.

678
00:48:52,436 --> 00:48:54,117
Now he has a girlfriend

679
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:55,912
so you will need a lot of energy tonight.

680
00:48:56,262 --> 00:48:58,367
She will be so happy.

681
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,434
Whoever she is.

682
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:03,450
Who knows? We might know who she is.

683
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:13,805
It's understandable
Jin Yi is acting that way.

684
00:49:14,396 --> 00:49:17,264
I'd feel betrayed also.

685
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,932
She has every right to be pissed.

686
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:24,925
<i>Dumpling is made with fillings
inside flour dough.</i>

687
00:49:24,925 --> 00:49:27,624
Gosh, when did I tell
you to search "dumpling"?

688
00:49:27,624 --> 00:49:30,715
How can I make up with Jin Yi?

689
00:49:30,715 --> 00:49:33,702
What should I do?

690
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,311
No Geu Rae, what are you doing out here?

691
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:37,985
Who were you on the phone with?

692
00:49:37,985 --> 00:49:40,322
Sound like someone close
according to your tone.

693
00:49:40,322 --> 00:49:43,876
We're close, but she's not a human.

694
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:45,865
What do you mean she's not a human?

695
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:50,128
I was talking to Siri.

696
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:52,900
- Siri?
- Yes.

697
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,175
Since I live alone

698
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:58,003
I don't have anybody to talk
to during tough times.

699
00:49:58,003 --> 00:50:00,626
So that's how it began...

700
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:04,602
I find it more comforting
than talking to myself.

701
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:09,421
We should say goodbye for tonight. Bye.

702
00:50:09,421 --> 00:50:11,425
<i>Goodbye.</i>

703
00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:16,202
What is it? Am I weird?

704
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:19,280
No, I feel sad for you.

705
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,981
Thinking how lonely you must
have felt to end up choosing that.

706
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:25,840
Now you don't need to do that anymore.

707
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,260
Whether it's something good or bad

708
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,564
you can share it with me and rely on me.

709
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,164
Tell me what you were talking
to her about just now.

710
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,559
It is...

711
00:50:42,543 --> 00:50:45,689
I'm sorry. We decided to
keep it a secret.

712
00:50:45,689 --> 00:50:47,320
But I ended up telling her.

713
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,052
Jin Yi accidentally saw our text.

714
00:50:51,052 --> 00:50:52,847
I had no choice but to tell her.

715
00:50:52,847 --> 00:50:55,490
Well, it's okay.

716
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:59,155
That's why she's been
onto me all this time.

717
00:50:59,155 --> 00:51:00,767
Please try to understand.

718
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:04,164
She's not herself after breaking
up with her longtime boyfriend.

719
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,436
She thought she and I
shared the same pain.

720
00:51:06,436 --> 00:51:08,901
But I didn't even tell her
after I started going out with you.

721
00:51:08,901 --> 00:51:10,727
She has every right to feel betrayed.

722
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,421
Again, she's so tacky.

723
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:18,035
It will be uncomfortable
if you stick around.

724
00:51:18,035 --> 00:51:19,990
- Why don't you leave first?
- No way.

725
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,811
I will stick around, send my drunk
girlfriend home, and then go.

726
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:25,811
What?

727
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:27,282
If I don't do that,
you will tell your phone

728
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:31,869
that your boyfriend has
left you alone and all.

729
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:34,974
I'd gladly take all the blame from her.

730
00:51:34,974 --> 00:51:37,124
For my girlfriend.

731
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:38,898
- Let's go back in.
- Sure.

732
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:07,155
You're doing it again.

733
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:09,233
Forget about the whole thing and go home.

734
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:11,488
You argued with your big brother
and ran away from home?

735
00:52:11,488 --> 00:52:13,220
You shouldn't do that.
It will become a habit.

736
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,331
- It's okay.
- What do you mean it's okay?

737
00:52:15,331 --> 00:52:18,613
Plus, continue studying.

738
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:20,300
It will be a waste if you stop now.

739
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,990
If you take the exam now,
you will do better than me.

740
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:27,280
Good for you that you
can move on quickly.

741
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,432
How long you suffer
after a breakup is proportional to

742
00:52:29,432 --> 00:52:32,095
how deeply you're in love.

743
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:33,664
I guess it was easy for him.

744
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:38,300
You punks are like cubic equations.

745
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,405
Why does it have to be so complicated?

746
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:42,296
Just snap out of it.

747
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:48,454
<i>[Jung Chae Yeon]</i>

748
00:52:52,782 --> 00:52:53,782
Hello?

749
00:52:53,874 --> 00:52:55,622
<i>[Jung Chae Yeon]</i>

750
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:00,760
- Hello?
- Hey.

751
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:09,003
You didn't tell Gong Myung
that I like him, did you?

752
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:11,260
What am I, a kid?
Why would I tell him that?

753
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,847
Then he's not avoiding me
because I have feelings for him.

754
00:53:14,276 --> 00:53:17,110
I haven't talked to him all day today.

755
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,403
<i>Do you happen to know where he is?</i>

756
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:21,367
He's here with me.

757
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:25,079
- What?
- I will put him on. Talk to him.

758
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,492
Take it. It's your master.

759
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,171
Hey, Master.

760
00:53:38,211 --> 00:53:41,296
I'm sorry, but something came up.

761
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:46,401
I will explain later.

762
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:48,631
I'm a bit drunk right now.

763
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:55,972
He even had a drink?

764
00:53:57,845 --> 00:53:59,724
Hey, Kim Ki Bum.

765
00:54:03,347 --> 00:54:05,356
You've really moved on, haven't you?

766
00:54:05,356 --> 00:54:07,956
- What?
- If I were you

767
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,488
I wouldn't have let
him talk to Chae Yeon.

768
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,521
Honestly, I still hate you so much.

769
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:15,756
For ruining my chance
with Joo Yeon for good.

770
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:18,918
But you didn't seem to hate Gong Myung.

771
00:54:18,918 --> 00:54:22,588
You took care of him all day
and even let him talk to Chae Yeon.

772
00:54:22,588 --> 00:54:24,780
It seems like you've moved on.

773
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:28,901
Is it that easy to just
pick up and move on?

774
00:54:28,901 --> 00:54:32,633
- What?
- But when he's suffering already

775
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:35,218
what's the point of hating him?

776
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,590
What's the big deal about women?

777
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,691
You know how long we've been friends for.

778
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:43,758
Hey, Kim Ki Bum.

779
00:54:43,758 --> 00:54:46,789
If I lost friends after losing love,
what would I do?

780
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:51,267
Then I would have
absolutely nothing left.

781
00:54:55,097 --> 00:54:59,251
So please don't hate me so much.

782
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:02,492
Joo Yeon must have said something
harsh because she got mad.

783
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:06,441
You two may be able to work things out.

784
00:55:06,441 --> 00:55:09,186
Think about the precious time
when you two were together.

785
00:55:09,186 --> 00:55:15,021
It's different from
unrequited love like mine.

786
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:28,617
He's acting disgustingly cool.

787
00:55:34,347 --> 00:55:36,365
Thanks so much for the clothes.

788
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:42,030
Gosh, what do we do?

789
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,675
She's really drunk.

790
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:46,785
No choice but to take
her home, Professor Min.

791
00:55:46,785 --> 00:55:47,985
What?

792
00:55:49,037 --> 00:55:50,579
Why should I?

793
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,856
What do you mean why?

794
00:55:51,856 --> 00:55:54,021
When she's that pretty,
how can we send her home alone?

795
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:55,910
Your place is on the way anyway.

796
00:55:57,662 --> 00:56:01,488
Gosh, you were carrying her
on your back in the mountain.

797
00:56:01,488 --> 00:56:02,916
Why are you acting
like you don't care now?

798
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:08,927
Tell me the truth. You were so happy
that you might die, huh?

799
00:56:08,927 --> 00:56:10,818
I almost died.

800
00:56:10,818 --> 00:56:12,028
What?

801
00:56:12,028 --> 00:56:14,318
A couple hours with her while hiking

802
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,369
was much harder than my entire marriage.

803
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,956
Gosh, it sucks.

804
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,867
Since she's drunk,
I will take her home.

805
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,613
There is no way I will
get entangled with her, ever.

806
00:56:30,613 --> 00:56:32,651
Absolutely not.

807
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,439
It was tough today.

808
00:56:34,439 --> 00:56:36,166
- We should go.
- We should.

809
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,378
What do you mean go home?
We should go for a second round.

810
00:56:39,378 --> 00:56:42,673
- Second round. To a karaoke!
- Just go.

811
00:56:42,673 --> 00:56:45,376
- Director Kim, I'm not going home.
- There is a taxi. Taxi!

812
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:47,744
- Director Kim.
- Just go home.

813
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:53,680
- Let's go. Watch your head.
- Director Kim!

814
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,106
Samsung-dong!

815
00:56:55,106 --> 00:56:56,454
- Get in.
- I'm off.

816
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:57,617
We will go.

817
00:56:59,231 --> 00:57:01,847
- Hey!
- I'm going to a karaoke.

818
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:03,655
- Get her.
- Director Kim.

819
00:57:03,655 --> 00:57:05,979
Just go!

820
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:07,787
Watch your head.

821
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,160
Bye now.

822
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,485
- Bye.
- Go ahead.

823
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:14,307
Mister, go.

824
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:20,894
Gosh, that piece of bad luck.

825
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:25,494
I was talking about
Professor Hwang, not you.

826
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:38,354
Everybody is betraying me.

827
00:57:39,506 --> 00:57:41,860
They are all backstabbing me.

828
00:57:42,677 --> 00:57:46,006
You guys are all the same.

829
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:50,407
At the end, I'm all alone.

830
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:52,126
What are you saying?

831
00:57:53,088 --> 00:57:55,974
Can we not talk until we get home?

832
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:57,389
Sure.

833
00:58:03,081 --> 00:58:05,501
What are you doing? You just got a text.

834
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:09,731
I wasn't expecting any.

835
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:26,528
<i>Jin Yi, I'm sorry.</i>

836
00:58:26,528 --> 00:58:30,010
<i>I ended up hurting you unintentionally.</i>

837
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,720
<i>I was debating
if I should tell you the truth.</i>

838
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,032
<i>But you were suffering so much.</i>

839
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:38,829
<i>I decided it wasn't the right time yet.</i>

840
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:40,660
<i>When I was suffering</i>

841
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,233
<i>you were there for me.</i>

842
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,843
<i>When you are suffering</i>

843
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:48,416
<i>I'm sorry that I'm happy alone.</i>

844
00:58:48,416 --> 00:58:53,260
<i>But I hope you don't suffer too long. </i>

845
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,885
<i>You will meet someone very nice.</i>

846
00:58:56,885 --> 00:59:01,184
<i>You really deserve that. </i>

847
00:59:10,097 --> 00:59:12,702
What is it?
What's wrong, Professor Hwang?

848
00:59:13,822 --> 00:59:16,099
I'm so humiliated.

849
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:23,468
I just realized how pathetic I am.

850
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:28,791
Because I was unhappy...

851
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:32,856
I couldn't stand others' happiness.

852
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:35,117
What are you talking about?

853
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:37,805
I have such a small mind.

854
00:59:37,805 --> 00:59:40,885
I so deserve to be dumped.

855
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:44,001
I don't deserve to be loved by anybody.

856
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,052
It's okay.

857
01:00:20,731 --> 01:00:22,622
It was you again, wasn't it?

858
01:00:22,816 --> 01:00:24,887
You talked him into playing
hooky again, didn't you?

859
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:27,035
- What?
- I don't have to be there to see it.

860
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:29,220
You're all about playing hooky.

861
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,508
So you talked him into doing it.

862
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,028
If you don't want to study

863
01:00:33,028 --> 01:00:34,943
pack up and leave Noryangjin alone.

864
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:38,001
Just because you gave up on your life,
don't ruin Gong Myung's life.

865
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,398
Jung Chae Yeon.

866
01:00:39,398 --> 01:00:43,010
Fine. I'm sorry.

867
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:52,077
You're such an asshole.

868
01:00:52,077 --> 01:00:53,970
How can you say that?

869
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:57,271
Ki Bum has been friends with
Gong Myung longer than you have.

870
01:00:57,271 --> 01:01:00,084
Ki Bum cares a lot more
about Gong Myung than you.

871
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:01,635
When he cares so much about him

872
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:03,789
he talked him into going out to drink?

873
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,771
When he's so determined to study...

874
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:11,086
Do you even know
why he's so determined to study?

875
01:01:11,086 --> 01:01:12,334
What?

876
01:01:12,334 --> 01:01:13,512
It's because of Professor Park.

877
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:15,374
He wants to pass the exams
and become her boyfriend.

878
01:01:15,374 --> 01:01:17,046
That's why he was studying so hard.

879
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:20,300
Jin Gong Myung likes
Professor Park Ha Na.

880
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:21,463
What?

881
01:01:21,463 --> 01:01:22,900
But it turns out that
she now has a boyfriend.

882
01:01:23,474 --> 01:01:25,139
It was because of Professor Park.

883
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:27,133
He wants to pass the exams
and become her boyfriend.

884
01:01:27,133 --> 01:01:28,713
That's why he was studying so hard.

885
01:01:28,713 --> 01:01:31,711
Jin Gong Myung likes
Professor Park Ha Na.

886
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:33,131
What?

887
01:01:33,131 --> 01:01:34,700
But it turns out that
she now has a boyfriend.

888
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,360
That's why he was feeling lost
and not answering his phone all day.

889
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,320
When he was like that all day

890
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,713
Kim Ki Bum was taking care of him.

891
01:01:41,713 --> 01:01:43,360
Get the facts straight.

892
01:02:04,229 --> 01:02:06,398
<i>I'm drinking solo.</i>

893
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:08,439
<i>When I drink solo</i>

894
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:11,977
<i>all the emotions that
I suppressed all day</i>

895
01:02:11,977 --> 01:02:16,981
<i>and the feelings
fill me up with the drink.</i>

896
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:43,789
<i>Where did it go wrong?</i>

897
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:47,849
<i>Why did we come to this?</i>

898
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:51,061
<i>We ask questions with no answers.</i>

899
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:12,307
<i>Soon we have to face
reality and accept it.</i>

900
01:03:27,557 --> 01:03:33,963
<i>But the truth and reality
may not be everything.</i>

901
01:03:33,963 --> 01:03:37,122
<i>If I lose that hope</i>

902
01:03:37,122 --> 01:03:43,878
<i>the love I nourished
until now seems so sad.</i>

903
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:53,014
<i>So I'm drinking this beer
because I need some courage. </i>

904
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:58,762
<i>A kind of courage that enables me
to say things I can't if I'm sober.</i>

905
01:04:07,034 --> 01:04:12,327
Gosh, I hate
saying goodbye to you tonight.

906
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,131
Before you go in

907
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:19,253
can you tell me the text
you sent me earlier?

908
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:20,838
The text?

909
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:24,434
You texted that you loved me.

910
01:04:24,434 --> 01:04:26,702
I want to hear it in person.

911
01:04:26,702 --> 01:04:30,836
Jin Yin sent that text, not me.

912
01:04:30,836 --> 01:04:31,936
What?

913
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,037
Gosh, you have no idea
how happy I was after I got it.

914
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:38,470
What should I do with this tacky woman?

915
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,224
I love you.

916
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,166
- See you tomorrow.
- Go ahead.

917
01:04:54,309 --> 01:04:55,626
Bye.

918
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:12,300
- What brings you here?
- I wanted to ask that question.

919
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,575
You told me not to mind.

920
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:18,068
You were going out with Professor Park?

921
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:22,941
True. Now you know.

922
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:25,624
When I told you
that I liked Professor Park

923
01:05:25,624 --> 01:05:27,387
you were already seeing her, weren't you?

924
01:05:28,963 --> 01:05:32,789
Why didn't you tell me the truth then?

925
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:35,588
I didn't want to start
an unnecessary fight.

926
01:05:35,588 --> 01:05:37,191
It was going to go away.

927
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:38,970
It was going to go away?

928
01:05:40,427 --> 01:05:41,427
True.

929
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:46,633
Was I supposed to care about
your feelings for your teacher?

930
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:48,450
My feelings?

931
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:50,905
How dare you? How dare you judge my love?

932
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:52,959
What?

933
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:55,251
"You"?

934
01:05:57,863 --> 01:05:59,852
Don't talk to me that way.

935
01:05:59,852 --> 01:06:01,104
I'm your big brother.

936
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:03,459
My big brother, my butt.

937
01:06:04,068 --> 01:06:06,606
What kind of brother ridicules
his little brother's feelings?

938
01:06:06,606 --> 01:06:09,300
You do everything your way.

939
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:12,997
You were always like that
and you're still the same.

940
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,017
You seriously...

941
01:06:15,017 --> 01:06:16,671
Why did I come here?

942
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:19,028
I came to tell Professor Park
that I won't give up on her.

943
01:06:20,483 --> 01:06:21,483
What?

944
01:06:21,483 --> 01:06:25,102
If she meets a nice guy,
I can let her go.

945
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:28,834
But that's not you.

946
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:31,912
I cannot let her go to someone like you.

947
01:06:32,713 --> 01:06:34,963
I cannot give up.

948
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:42,400
Gosh, that kid, seriously...

949
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:07,900
