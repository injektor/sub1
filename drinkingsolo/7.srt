- Is she perhaps the Korean teacher?</font>

<font color="yellow"><i>Professor Park!</i></font>

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,200

- Oh, come on.</i></font>

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
<font color="yellow"><i>It is you, Professor Park!</i></font>

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,899
<font color="yellow"><i>You're my favorite student in Noryangjin.</i></font>

11
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,940
<font color="yellow">Rather than your favorite student,
can I become your boyfriend?</font>

12
00:00:25,947 --> 00:00:27,199
<font color="yellow"><i>He must be so angry
because of me.</i></font>

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh man!</i></font>

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,899
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought he put me in the joint class
as a replacement and got so mad.</i></font>

15
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,699
<font color="yellow"><i>And I can't even avoid him tomorrow!</i></font>

16
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,699
<font color="yellow"><i>Why did she even yell at
me while she was drunk</i></font>

17
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,000
<font color="yellow"><i>if she was going to be so
self-conscious about it?</i></font>

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,500
<font color="yellow"><i>I think it'd be better if
Ms. No Geu Rae stood next to me.</i></font>

19
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:39,699
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
Hurry up and get over here.</font>

20

<font color="yellow"><i>Don't do what others want
you to do all the time.</i></font>

22
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,571
<font color="yellow"><i>Does he... really like me?</i></font>

23
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,399
<font color="yellow"><i>I thought he was crazy.
He is indeed crazy.</i></font>

24
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:58,300
<font color="yellow"><i>Stop playing around. Focus on studying
now that you are in Noryangjin.</i></font>

25
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,699
<font color="yellow"><i>You're absolutely right.</i></font>

26

I should be studying.</i></font>

Why's she holding her umbrella like that?</i></font>

30
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:13,500
<font color="yellow"><i>She's getting drenched!</i></font>

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
<font color="yellow"><i>Oh, geez.</i></font>

32

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Are you really all right?</i></font>

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,699
<font color="yellow"><i>It's okay.</i></font>

38
00:01:26,699 --> 00:01:28,289
<font color="yellow"><i>Why are you okay
with everything all the time?</i></font>

39
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,899
<font color="yellow"><i>You can tell me when you're not okay.</i></font>

40
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:31,900
<font color="yellow"><i>- I'm not okay!
- Whoa!</i></font>

41
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,199
<font color="yellow"><i>- I said I'm not fine!
- Professor.</i></font>

42
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,600
<font color="yellow"><i>You really should have a boyfriend.</i></font>

43
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,900
<font color="yellow"><i>Why not become my girlfriend, huh?</i></font>

<font color="yellow"><i>[Episode 7]</i></font>

45
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,900
<font color="yellow"><i>I love drinking solo.</i></font>

46
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,799
<font color="yellow"><i>Since my job entails talking all day,
having this time when I don't have to...</i></font>

47
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,799
<font color="yellow"><i>this solitude...
is the best.</i></font>

48
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,199
<font color="yellow"><i>I have a couple of rules for myself
when I drink solo.</i></font>

49
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:31,699
<font color="yellow"><i>First: I have to drink in a place
with a luxurious atmosphere.</i></font>

50
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:38,241
<font color="yellow"><i>Second: I have to snack on
something luxurious while I drink.</i></font>

51
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:49,942
<font color="yellow"><i>Third: I have to drink
with some class.</i></font>

52
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:56,241
<font color="yellow"><i>A time just for myself.
A time of healing.</i></font>

53
00:02:56,741 --> 00:03:01,241
<font color="yellow"><i>This is the reason why
I love drinking solo.</i></font>

54
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:24,042
<font color="yellow">Who's the owner of this
delectably divine body?</font>

55
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,841
<font color="yellow">Who? Oh.
Jin Gong Myung, huh?</font>

56
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,241
<font color="yellow">Yep, that's me!</font>

57
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,542
<font color="yellow">What the hell was that?</font>

58
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,241
<font color="yellow">You're asking as if you don't know?</font>

59
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,741
<font color="yellow">They're receipts for the toll
gates at Incheon and Yeosu!</font>

60
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,542
<font color="yellow">You've been taking a hell of
a road trip all over the country, huh?</font>

61
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,542
<font color="yellow">The miles on my car
went up like crazy</font>

62
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,842
<font color="yellow">so did you think I really wouldn't notice
just because you filled it with gas?</font>

63
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:01,141
<font color="yellow">Fine!
I did drive it a little!</font>

64
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,741
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with your
one and only little brother</font>

65
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,542
<font color="yellow">driving a great car
that you don't even use?</font>

66
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,641
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

67
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:11,241
<font color="yellow">If you want to drive a nice car,
earn the money to buy one yourself.</font>

68
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:16,042
<font color="yellow">I hate people like you who
freeload off others the most--</font>

69
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:27,741
<font color="yellow">Oh?</font>

70
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:31,941
<font color="yellow">I'm not the same Jin Gong Myung
you used to boss around.</font>

71
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:34,241
<font color="yellow">Don't you see these muscles?</font>

72
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:38,342
<font color="yellow">Oh my. To think that I'd dared to stand
up against a strong man such as yourself.</font>

73
00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:39,641
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my.
I'm terribly sorry.</font>

74
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:41,141
<font color="yellow">Let me offer you a formal apology.</font>

75
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,241
<font color="yellow">Don't do that again, all right?</font>

76
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,941
<font color="yellow">I'm telling you this now
so that we're clear on this</font>

77
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,941
<font color="yellow">but I have no intention
of letting you live with me for long.</font>

78
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:51,941
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

79
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:53,842
<font color="yellow">If you do anything like this again, your
ass will be on its way to the orchard.</font>

80
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,141
<font color="yellow">You got that?</font>

81
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:00,542
<font color="yellow">Stop right there!</font>

82
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:03,342
<font color="yellow">- Stop.
- Would you stop, if you were me?</font>

83
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:07,342
<font color="yellow">You act like you're such hot shit just
because you have a house and some cars!</font>

84
00:05:07,342 --> 00:05:09,641
<font color="yellow">You're so petty!</font>

85
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:13,141
<font color="yellow">You better find yourself
the next express bus back home!</font>

86
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,641
<font color="yellow">Professor!</font>

87
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,342
<font color="yellow">Oh, why are you here?</font>

88
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:38,342
<font color="yellow">I was worried about how you were.
And you didn't pick up my calls either.</font>

89
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:40,141
<font color="yellow">Oh, I didn't have time
to check my phone.</font>

90
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,042
<font color="yellow">I was putting my furniture out to
dry since it's a nice day today.</font>

91
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,842
<font color="yellow">All of your furniture got wet
when your place flooded, right?</font>

92
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:50,941
<font color="yellow">- I'll help you!
- No, no! It's fine!</font>

93
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:51,941
<font color="yellow">Go and study.</font>

94
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,941
<font color="yellow">Hey, I told you already that
I'm a student who doesn't study!</font>

95
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,741
<font color="yellow">Let me help you out
real quick.</font>

96
00:05:57,241 --> 00:05:58,941
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's fine!</font>

97
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,042
<font color="yellow">Oh my!</font>

98
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:05,342
<font color="yellow">I told you, it's fine.</font>

99
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:09,941
<font color="yellow">Wow, are you a gymnast?
You're good enough to get a gold medal!</font>

100
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,042
<font color="yellow">I told you
you don't need to help me.</font>

101
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:24,141
<font color="yellow">I feel bad that you helped
me move my furniture.</font>

102
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,241
<font color="yellow">I told you. I don't have anything
else to be doing anyway.</font>

103
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,542
<font color="yellow">How does it make sense that a student
studying for exams has nothing to do?</font>

104
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:29,542
<font color="yellow">You should study!</font>

105
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,241
<font color="yellow">Teach. Lecturing me
is forbidden today, all right?</font>

106
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,741
<font color="yellow">I already fought with my
Big Bro this morning.</font>

107
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,342
<font color="yellow">I got an earful of nagging
just like that from him too.</font>

108
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:37,641
<font color="yellow">Ugh, he's so annoying.</font>

109
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,741
<font color="yellow">Are you not on good terms
with your older brother?</font>

110
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:41,641
<font color="yellow">Yes. Totally.</font>

111
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,342
<font color="yellow">I just can't seem to like him!</font>

112
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:46,342
<font color="yellow">He thinks he's all that
and talks down to me all the time!</font>

113
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:52,042
<font color="yellow">Doesn't he know that words
hurt more than a knife?</font>

114
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:56,842
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Words do hurt
quite a bit.</font>

115
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,741
<font color="yellow">Whatever. Who else
could I blame but myself?</font>

116
00:06:59,741 --> 00:07:02,441
<font color="yellow">This is my fault for misjudging you.</font>

117
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:06,941
<font color="yellow">It seems that I thought
too highly of you, Ms. No Geu Rae.</font>

118
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,941
<font color="yellow">Ugh. I'll stop thinking about
that annoying guy and just clean.</font>

119
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,842
<font color="yellow">Oh, good idea!
My back was starting to hurt too!</font>

120
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,141
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!</font>

121
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,241
<font color="yellow">Wow, Teach! Looks like you're showing
off your flexibility quite a lot today.</font>

122
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:35,542
<font color="yellow">That move was totally
gold medal-worthy too!</font>

123
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,342
<font color="yellow">Um, Gong Myung...
can you help me up?</font>

124
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:41,542
<font color="yellow">Oh, sure.</font>

125
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:53,241
<font color="yellow">It's really no joke,
living in a semi-basement.</font>

126
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,741
<font color="yellow">It floods when it rains, and everything.</font>

127
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,242
<font color="yellow">It's fine. It's not like
this is the first time.</font>

128
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:01,242
<font color="yellow">What a relief.</font>

129
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,242
<font color="yellow">To tell you the truth,
the real reason why I came</font>

130
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,441
<font color="yellow">was because I thought
you might be depressed.</font>

131
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,841
<font color="yellow">Nah. I'm okay now.</font>

132
00:08:07,841 --> 00:08:10,542
<font color="yellow">I have to shake this off
and work even harder.</font>

133
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:13,341
<font color="yellow">And I'll get tons of new
students to take my class</font>

134
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,441
<font color="yellow">and save some money to move out of
that semi-basement. That's my goal.</font>

135
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,142
<font color="yellow">My goal is to become
your boyfriend, Teach.</font>

136
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,542
<font color="yellow">It'd be nice if both of us
achieved our goals soon.</font>

137
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,142
<font color="yellow">Stop it with that nonsense
and go study already!</font>

138
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:37,176
<font color="yellow">I want to, but I just can't
seem to find the willpower.</font>

139
00:08:37,176 --> 00:08:39,841
<font color="yellow">And it's not like I have
much motivation either.</font>

140
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:44,142
<font color="yellow">Sheesh.</font>

141
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:45,941
<font color="yellow">Fine, then.</font>

142
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:52,341
<font color="yellow">In order to motivate you, I will do
one thing you ask for if you pass.</font>

143
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:54,941
<font color="yellow">Really?</font>

144
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:58,341
<font color="yellow">Then...</font>

145
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:01,242
<font color="yellow">go out with me.</font>

146
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,642
<font color="yellow">- What?
- You said you'd grant me a wish.</font>

147
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,529
<font color="yellow">And what I want is to
be your boyfriend.</font>

148
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,042
<font color="yellow">All right! If I pass,
we'll be dating!</font>

149
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:14,242
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah.
I need evidence.</font>

150
00:09:15,341 --> 00:09:16,742
<font color="yellow">All right, repeat after me.</font>

151
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:21,441
<font color="yellow">"I, Park Ha Na, will date Jin Gong Myung
if he passes the civil servant exam."</font>

152
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:33,242
<font color="yellow">If Jin Gong Myung passes the civil
servant exam, I, Park Ha Na, will...</font>

153
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,542
<font color="yellow">will seriously consider dating him.</font>

154
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,341
<font color="yellow">Hey, come on!</font>

155
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:44,042
<font color="yellow">Well, fine.
This much is okay.</font>

156
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:49,341
<font color="yellow">Wow. I should hurry and move your
furniture and then go study!</font>

157
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:53,941
<font color="yellow">Professor.
You'll become my woman soon.</font>

158
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:57,542
<font color="yellow">Come on.
Let's go!</font>

159
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:02,841
<font color="yellow">Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.</font>

160
00:10:03,542 --> 00:10:06,941
<font color="yellow">Oh, whatever. Getting him to
pass is all that matters!</font>

161
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:11,441
<font color="yellow">It's not like he'd care about his old
teacher after he passes, anyway.</font>

162
00:10:19,742 --> 00:10:21,542
<font color="yellow"><i>I love drinking solo.</i></font>

163
00:10:23,042 --> 00:10:27,042
<font color="yellow"><i>Drinking solo on an evening
on the weekend feels more leisurely</i></font>

164
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,941
<font color="yellow"><i>and comfortable.</i></font>

165
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:32,642
<font color="yellow"><i>I have a couple of rules for myself
when I drink solo--</i></font>

166
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:34,542
<font color="yellow">Oh, look at you,
eating so well!</font>

167
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:39,142
<font color="yellow">How is it that you look so pretty
even when you're eating?</font>

168
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:41,142
<font color="yellow">You're so pretty!</font>

169
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:45,042
<font color="yellow"><i>I hate people who get drunk and
shamelessly get touchy-feely in public!</i></font>

170
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:49,841
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello? This is
Ms. Park Ha Na's phone.</i></font>

171
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:51,242
<font color="yellow"><i>Hello?</i></font>

172
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:55,042
<font color="yellow"><i>I bet that No Geu Rae
is just like that with her boyfriend.</i></font>

173
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:57,242
<font color="yellow"><i>And after she made a mess
of my joint class too!</i></font>

174
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,441
<font color="yellow">How dare she be dating
someone in her state?</font>

175
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:07,542
<font color="yellow">This is no time for No Geu Rae
to be dating someone!</font>

176
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,242
<font color="yellow">She should work on
her lesson plans instead!</font>

177
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:15,341
<font color="yellow">Figures. Her mind is elsewhere, so how
could she be lesson-planning efficiently?</font>

178
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,841
<font color="yellow">Your apartment flooded too?</font>

179
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,242
<font color="yellow">Living in that semi-basement
is the problem.</font>

180
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:27,941
<font color="yellow">But still, it's a relief that
your student helped you.</font>

181
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:30,142
<font color="yellow">I know, right, Jin Yi?
It was so hard!</font>

182
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,441
<font color="yellow">Oh no!</font>

183
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,941
<font color="yellow">- Oof!
- Oh, you're so heavy.</font>

184
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,742
<font color="yellow">- Just a moment.
- Get your shoe back on!</font>

185
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,542
<font color="yellow">- Oh my.
- Are you okay?</font>

186
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,941
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry!</font>

187
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:46,841
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?
This is the entrance to the parking lot!</font>

188
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:49,542
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. My shoe fell off.</font>

189
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,042
<font color="yellow">Why would your shoe fall off here?</font>

190
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,042
<font color="yellow">It's because your mind is elsewhere
that your shoe fell off!</font>

191
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,242
<font color="yellow">Hurry up and move!</font>

192
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:55,642
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

193
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:01,642
<font color="yellow">What does he mean
your mind is elsewhere?</font>

194
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,242
<font color="yellow">I'm not sure.</font>

195
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:05,542
<font color="yellow">He really is Premium Trash!</font>

196
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,142
<font color="yellow">He really is an ass.</font>

197
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,341
<font color="yellow">If he almost hit someone with his car,
he should apologize, not yell at you!</font>

198
00:12:10,341 --> 00:12:12,642
<font color="yellow">I think it's because
he's mad at me.</font>

199
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:16,841
<font color="yellow">He was mad because I passed
out during the first joint class</font>

200
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,242
<font color="yellow">and ruined the class's image.</font>

201
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:22,341
<font color="yellow">He's the type to run you over with
his car if you pass out again!</font>

202
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,042
<font color="yellow">Are you okay?</font>

203
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:37,242
<font color="yellow">I told myself that I'd be strong,
but Professor Jin got so angry at me.</font>

204
00:12:38,242 --> 00:12:40,042
<font color="yellow">This is so hard on me.</font>

205
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,841
<font color="yellow"><i>There is a saying for when
you're facing hard times.</i></font>

206
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:44,841
<font color="yellow"><i>They say that suffering is
a necessary ingredient</i></font>

207
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,542
<font color="yellow"><i>to bake the bread
called "tomorrow."</i></font>

208
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,042
<font color="yellow"><i>Cheer up.</i></font>

209
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,841
<font color="yellow">Wow, you're actually consoling me?</font>

210
00:12:54,542 --> 00:13:00,941
<font color="yellow">Thanks. I think I'll be able to be
strong since you always hear me out.</font>

211
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,642
<font color="yellow">Wow, look at her
having a fun time.</font>

212
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:05,742
<font color="yellow">She's talking to her boyfriend on the
phone as soon as she comes to work?</font>

213
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:09,341
<font color="yellow">You'll continue to be by
my side like this, right?</font>

214
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:13,242
<font color="yellow">I don't think I'll be
able to live without you.</font>

215
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:21,094
<font color="yellow">Um, Professor Jin!</font>

216
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:26,142
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry for bothering you with
the issue regarding the joint class.</font>

217
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:29,742
<font color="yellow">That won't ever happen again.
Please, trust me.</font>

218
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,042
<font color="yellow">Well, I don't know.
I can't trust you.</font>

219
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:35,142
<font color="yellow">I feel like your mind is
already elsewhere.</font>

220
00:13:35,142 --> 00:13:38,242
<font color="yellow">So how could I possibly believe you?</font>

221
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:44,941
<font color="yellow">What the hell?
Why does he keep saying that?</font>

222
00:13:47,242 --> 00:13:49,042
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Ki Bum.
Lend me some toothpaste.</font>

223
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,941
<font color="yellow">Whoa. Are you studying
by any chance?</font>

224
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:58,941
<font color="yellow">I told you. I'm going to become a
grandson that my grandma can be proud of.</font>

225
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,542
<font color="yellow">And in order to do that, I have no
choice but to hurry and pass.</font>

226
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,242
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to study
hard, starting today.</font>

227
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,742
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

228
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,642
<font color="yellow">Yeah. So leave, so I can study.</font>

229
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:09,441
<font color="yellow">I'll just grab a tiny bit of toothpaste
and be on my way.</font>

230
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:45,142
<font color="yellow">I can't focus because
my desk is such a mess.</font>

231
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,142
<font color="yellow">Oh, there we go.</font>

232
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:05,742
<font color="yellow">Why is it so messy in here?</font>

233
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:16,441
<font color="yellow">Now I really feel like studying!</font>

234
00:15:26,441 --> 00:15:31,042
<font color="yellow">Why are my nails so long?
It's getting on my nerves.</font>

235
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,700
<font color="yellow">I'm going to mix my leftovers from
yesterday with some rice and eat it!</font>

236
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,499
<font color="yellow">What are you doing?</font>

237
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:56,399
<font color="yellow">Can't you tell?
I'm cleaning the refrigerator.</font>

238
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,199
<font color="yellow">I thought you said you made up your
mind to study. Why are you cleaning?</font>

239
00:15:58,199 --> 00:15:59,499
<font color="yellow">I was going to, see?</font>

240
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,599
<font color="yellow">But the fact that the refrigerator here
is so dirty bothered me so much</font>

241
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:04,300
<font color="yellow">that I couldn't focus!</font>

242
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,300
<font color="yellow">As if. You're just making up excuses
because you don't want to study.</font>

243
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,099
<font color="yellow">Is that what it is?</font>

244
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:15,599
<font color="yellow">Figures. Cleaning the refrigerator is
so much fun compared to studying.</font>

245
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,099
<font color="yellow">I want to clean the bathrooms
and even the stairs.</font>

246
00:16:18,099 --> 00:16:20,199
<font color="yellow">I never knew that cleaning was this fun!</font>

247
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,499
<font color="yellow">Crazy bastard.</font>

248
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you see a can of
spicy tuna in the refrigerator?</font>

249
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, the thing that only
had oil left in the can?</font>

250
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
<font color="yellow">- Yeah.
- I threw it away.</font>

251
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
<font color="yellow">Hey!</font>

252
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,099
<font color="yellow">Don't you know how good it tastes
if you mix that oil with some rice?</font>

253
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,599
<font color="yellow">Why did you have to go
and clean when nobody asked you to</font>

254
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,699
<font color="yellow">and ruin my lunch?</font>

255
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:41,800
<font color="yellow">If you're going to be such a nuisance,
just give up on studying</font>

256
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
<font color="yellow">and live the way
you've always lived!</font>

257
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,500
<font color="yellow">No, I can't! I have to pass and become a
grandson that my grandma can be proud of!</font>

258
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
<font color="yellow">I really am going to study hard!</font>

259
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,000
<font color="yellow">But I got started with this already,
so let me just finish up.</font>

260
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,800
<font color="yellow">Crazy bastard.</font>

261
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:01,599
<font color="yellow">Damn it, it smudged.</font>

262
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:09,599
<font color="yellow">Must you really take those like that?</font>

263
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,199
<font color="yellow">Did it make you feel
good to do that?</font>

264
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,099
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh, you surprised me.
What's the matter?</font>

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,398
<font color="yellow">Did you have to take my tissues?
Did it make you feel good to do that?</font>

266
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,099
<font color="yellow">Oh my gosh. You're really going to
be like this over some tissues?</font>

267
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,099
<font color="yellow">Here, take them back!</font>

268
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,699
<font color="yellow">Why are you dressed
so normally today though?</font>

269
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:31,599
<font color="yellow">You're not doing
an impersonation today?</font>

270
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,800
<font color="yellow">I just did one.
You don't know it?</font>

271
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,599
<font color="yellow"><i>- Did you really have to...</i>
- Did you really have to...</font>

272
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,800
<font color="yellow"><i>- take everything like this...</i>
- take everything like this...</font>

273
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,398
<font color="yellow"><i>- to make yourself feel better?</i>
- to make yourself feel better?</font>

274
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,898
<font color="yellow">If you're going to do an impersonation,
do something that's famous!</font>

275
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,398
<font color="yellow">I still can't even tell
where this is from.</font>

276
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:51,000
<font color="yellow">Why not?
This is super famous!</font>

277
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,699
<font color="yellow">Geez, how annoying.</font>

278
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:05,699
<font color="yellow">What is that noise?</font>

279
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's just a telemarketer.</font>

280
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,699
<font color="yellow">It's my ringtone.
"Chilgapsan."</font>

281
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:12,099
<font color="yellow">It's my mom's go-to song
when she goes to karaoke.</font>

282
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,300
<font color="yellow">It brings back memories.</font>

283
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,571
<font color="yellow"><i>Young Miss, who's
off to the bean field...</i></font>

284
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:22,300
<font color="yellow">Why is that Young Miss going
to the bean field anyway?</font>

285
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,398
<font color="yellow">Does she not work?</font>

286
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:26,300
<font color="yellow">Well, it's her job to go
and work in the bean field, probably.</font>

287
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,599
<font color="yellow">At any rate, I don't want to hear it,
so change your ringtone right now.</font>

288
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,199
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

289
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,000
<font color="yellow">What's with him? What does
he have against bean fields?</font>

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,800
<font color="yellow">I don't know either.</font>

291
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,099
<font color="yellow">Do you really have to criticize
the woman who's going to the bean field</font>

292
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:47,898
<font color="yellow">to make yourself
feel better?</font>

293
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:50,199
<font color="yellow">Stop it already!</font>

294
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,599
<font color="yellow">- Oh, it's her.
- Did you see the video too?</font>

295
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:12,138
<font color="yellow">Don't listen to them.
You just have to do well today.</font>

296
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:15,398
<font color="yellow">I'll teach an amazing class in
front of those 1,000 students!</font>

297
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:18,099
<font color="yellow">Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!</font>

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,599
<font color="yellow">This is the joint Korean class, right?</font>

299
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,699
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

300
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:40,699
<font color="yellow">Is today some special day?
Where is everyone?</font>

301
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,800
<font color="yellow">All of you were quite shocked because I
passed out during the first class, right?</font>

302
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:54,398
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, everyone.
That won't happen again, so don't worry.</font>

303
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:56,099
<font color="yellow">I'll get started now, then.</font>

304
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:04,398
<font color="yellow">Does this make any sense?</font>

305
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,099
<font color="yellow">Professor Park.
You saw, didn't you?</font>

306
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,599
<font color="yellow">You saw how
your lecture hall is so empty now.</font>

307
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,800
<font color="yellow">Yes. Actually, I was curious about that.
Is today some special day?</font>

308
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,300
<font color="yellow">Where were all the students?</font>

309
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,898
<font color="yellow">You really are naïve, aren't you?</font>

310
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:23,500
<font color="yellow">Why else? They didn't want to take
your class, so they didn't come!</font>

311
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,300
<font color="yellow">I asked some students since
your lecture hall was so empty</font>

312
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,699
<font color="yellow">and they said that they'd take Korean
under a different instructor</font>

313
00:20:29,699 --> 00:20:31,699
<font color="yellow">because you're untrustworthy!</font>

314
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,398
<font color="yellow">What? Oh...</font>

315
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:39,000
<font color="yellow">Don't worry too much,
Professor Jin.</font>

316
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,898
<font color="yellow">I'll do whatever it takes to get
the enrollment numbers back up. Okay?</font>

317
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,300
<font color="yellow">What are you going to
do about this, huh?</font>

318
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,099
<font color="yellow">Next time, nobody will take this joint
class even if Professor Jin is in it!</font>

319
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,300
<font color="yellow">This won't do.</font>

320
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,800
<font color="yellow">Take over the web broadcast</font>

321
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,211
<font color="yellow">that Professor Shin Yong Sook
was supposed to do today.</font>

322
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:59,099
<font color="yellow">A web broadcast?
You do those here too?</font>

323
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,599
<font color="yellow">Yes, once a month.</font>

324
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:05,500
<font color="yellow">The professors take turns
doing web broadcasts for students.</font>

325
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,199
<font color="yellow">They promote themselves
and talk to students too.</font>

326
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:15,599
<font color="yellow">I don't care what you have to do.
Use that to change the students' minds!</font>

327
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,699
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

328
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:21,898
<font color="yellow">I'm going to keep my eyes peeled
and see how many people come in!</font>

329
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,599
<font color="yellow">Yes, sir.</font>

330
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:32,300
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, Professor Jin!
I'll solve this issue no matter what!</font>

331
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,500
<font color="yellow">This is really your last shot.
Do whatever it takes!</font>

332
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,398
<font color="yellow">You're way too soft!
Seriously!</font>

333
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,000
<font color="yellow">When it's too public that
you can't make it private...</font>

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,898
<font color="yellow">and the principle of the market and
performance management come together...</font>

335
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:01,300
<font color="yellow">and when things
become predictable...</font>

336
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,500
<font color="yellow">that's when executive agency is needed.</font>

337
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,300
<font color="yellow">I'm putting my all into lecturing you.</font>

338
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:17,800
<font color="yellow">Did you have to fall asleep like
that to make yourself feel better?</font>

339
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,099
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

340
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:23,898
<font color="yellow">All right, that's the end of this
lecture. See you all next time.</font>

341
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:25,599
<font color="yellow">- Thank you!
- Yes!</font>

342
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you!</font>

343
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,898
<font color="yellow">Geez, he surprised me.</font>

344
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:33,199
<font color="yellow">Did you have to yell like that
to make yourself feel better?</font>

345
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,398
<font color="yellow">Hey. If you were going to sleep, you
should've stayed at the student hostel.</font>

346
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,099
<font color="yellow">Why did you come all the way
here only to fall asleep?</font>

347
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:43,500
<font color="yellow">It's not like I fell asleep
because I wanted to!</font>

348
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,898
<font color="yellow">I came to study, but just
happened to fall asleep.</font>

349
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,300
<font color="yellow">Aw man. I studied so hard
that I got tired.</font>

350
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,898
<font color="yellow">I'll go and study now,
since I got a lot of rest.</font>

351
00:22:55,898 --> 00:22:57,500
<font color="yellow">See ya.</font>

352
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,099
<font color="yellow">What are we going to do
about that guy?</font>

353
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:08,800
<font color="yellow">He said he'd study hard from now
on, but it doesn't look like he is.</font>

354
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,500
<font color="yellow">Wait, Ki Bum said that
he's studying hard now too?</font>

355
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,800
<font color="yellow">Me too.</font>

356
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
<font color="yellow">What? You too?</font>

357
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,898
<font color="yellow">Weren't you just going to spend a year
here to escape your mom's nagging?</font>

358
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:20,699
<font color="yellow">Yeah, but I changed my mind.
I have a reason why I have to pass now.</font>

359
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,898
<font color="yellow">So, with that in mind... can you give me
your notes from this lecture?</font>

360
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:27,300
<font color="yellow">What? What were you doing
if you weren't taking notes?</font>

361
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,300
<font color="yellow">I was making
a schedule for studying.</font>

362
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,699
<font color="yellow">Ta-da!</font>

363
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:33,599
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard.</font>

364
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,000
<font color="yellow">I thought you said that you
made up your mind to study.</font>

365
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,054
<font color="yellow">But you were drawing this
instead of listening to the lecture?</font>

366
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:41,500
<font color="yellow">Hey, if I'm going to do it,
I need to follow a schedule!</font>

367
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,099
<font color="yellow">I honestly don't want
to study, you know.</font>

368
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,099
<font color="yellow">Anyway, give me your notes!</font>

369
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,199
<font color="yellow">Why, you little...</font>

370
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,300
<font color="yellow">Thanks, buddy!</font>

371
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:02,398
<font color="yellow">Oh, hey, Jung Chae Yeon.</font>

372
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:05,000
<font color="yellow">I came to Noryangjin to study,
so I'm planning to do just that.</font>

373
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,599
<font color="yellow">What's with him?</font>

374
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,000
<font color="yellow">Hey, I heard about what happened.</font>

375
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,599
<font color="yellow">Oh man, those kids are so cruel.</font>

376
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,599
<font color="yellow">How could they all drop out like that
just because you fainted once?</font>

377
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,099
<font color="yellow">It's only natural that they'd do that.</font>

378
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:50,099
<font color="yellow">She didn't try her best, so why would
students want to take her class?</font>

379
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,099
<font color="yellow">What?
What do you mean--</font>

380
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:55,099
<font color="yellow">If you're going to teach students who are
putting their lives on the line to study</font>

381
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,599
<font color="yellow">you have to put your life
at risk to teach them</font>

instructor, Ms. No Geu Rae.</font>

383
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,500
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?
I am!</font>

384
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
<font color="yellow">I'm giving this everything that
I've got and doing my best!</font>

385
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,000
<font color="yellow">You're giving this everything
you've got, eh?</font>

386
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,673
<font color="yellow">How can you say that
when your mind is elsewhere?</font>

387
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,076
<font color="yellow">Why do you keep saying that today?</font>

388
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,500
<font color="yellow">You really don't know? Ms. No Geu Rae
is dating someone right now!</font>

389
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
<font color="yellow">You seriously think you should be
dating someone right now?</font>

390
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,099
<font color="yellow">What is he saying?
You're dating, Professor Park?</font>

391
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,500
<font color="yellow">- No!
- Yeah!</font>

392
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,699
<font color="yellow">She's basically
a chronically single person!</font>

393
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,300
<font color="yellow">I guess you don't know either</font>

394
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,599
<font color="yellow">but she was drinking with her boyfriend
on the night she passed out!</font>

395
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,099
<font color="yellow">I even spoke to her boyfriend
on the phone myself!</font>

396
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:30,099
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

397
00:25:30,099 --> 00:25:31,099
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

398
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,300
<font color="yellow"><i>[Call Yesterday From: Premium Trash]</i></font>

399
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,800
<font color="yellow">Oh!</font>

400
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,099
<font color="yellow">He's not my boyfriend!
He's my student!</font>

401
00:25:39,099 --> 00:25:41,500
<font color="yellow">I think that the student
I was with picked up my phone.</font>

402
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,398
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. You said that your
semi-basement room flooded, right?</font>

403
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:49,300
<font color="yellow">You're talking about the student who
came by to help you that day, right?</font>

404
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:52,898
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin!
Your assumption was wrong.</font>

405
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:53,898
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

406
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:57,300
<font color="yellow">Well, who cares if it was a student
instead of a boyfriend?</font>

407
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,099
<font color="yellow">Do you think it's acceptable to
be drinking with your student?</font>

408
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,099
<font color="yellow">Get it together!
Got it?</font>

409
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, so that's why he kept on going on
about you being distracted.</font>

410
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,500
<font color="yellow">It's because he thought
you had a boyfriend, right?</font>

411
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,599
<font color="yellow">How could he do that to poor Professor
Park, who doesn't have a boyfriend?</font>

412
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:18,699
<font color="yellow">Did you have to make her feel pathetic
like that to make yourself feel better?</font>

413
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,898
<font color="yellow">That terrible man.</font>

414
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,300
<font color="yellow">What? That wasn't her boyfriend, then?</font>

415
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,398
<font color="yellow">She's basically chronically single?</font>

416
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:38,199
<font color="yellow">Figures. Who'd like
a tacky woman like her?</font>

417
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,500
<font color="yellow">What's with that No Geu Rae?</font>

418
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:47,398
<font color="yellow">She should feel happy that someone
thought she had a boyfriend in her state!</font>

419
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,898
<font color="yellow">How dare she get mad at me!</font>

420
00:26:55,898 --> 00:26:58,500
<font color="yellow">It's because she has such a temper that
she doesn't have a boyfriend.</font>

421
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,898
<font color="yellow">She doesn't even have a boyfriend!</font>

422
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:05,000
