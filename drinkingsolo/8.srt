00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,399
<font color="yellow">Why is it so noisy in here?
Lower the volume!</font>

7
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:29,100
<font color="yellow">People are going to think that
we're throwing a party here!</font>

8
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:33,499
<font color="yellow">You're the one who was
out partying, though.</font>

9
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
<font color="yellow">Wow.</font>

10
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,600
<font color="yellow">What kind of relationship
do you have with her?</font>

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,899
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?
We're just coworkers.</font>

12
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,899
<font color="yellow">Oh, just coworkers, huh?</font>

13
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,700
<font color="yellow">And yet you went on as a guest
on her show and danced</font>

14
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,200
<font color="yellow">and even went to take a photo
in front of the fireworks with her?</font>

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,999
<font color="yellow">You, the almighty Jin Jung Seok,
who doesn't care about others?</font>

16
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:59,499
<font color="yellow">Tell me the truth. What kind of
relationship do you two have?</font>

17
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:02,100
<font color="yellow">Hey. You...</font>

18
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,499
<font color="yellow">You know that Professor Park is
part of my joint class, right?</font>

19
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:11,700
<font color="yellow">But she was doing such tacky things today
that I had no choice to go and help her!</font>

20
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,999
<font color="yellow">For the sake of maintaining
the quality of the joint class.</font>

21
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:14,999
<font color="yellow">Really?
Are you telling the truth?</font>

22
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:15,999
<font color="yellow">Yes! Geez!</font>

23
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:19,499
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this for my sake
and for the sake of my joint class!</font>

24
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:24,399
<font color="yellow">But... why do you care what kind
of relationship I have with her?</font>

25
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,700
<font color="yellow">Huh?</font>

26
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:28,700
<font color="yellow">Well, um...</font>

27
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,899
<font color="yellow">What, I can't be curious
about my Big Bro's life?</font>

28
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:39,400
<font color="yellow">Stop being curious about useless things
like that and channel that energy</font>

29
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,199
<font color="yellow">to try and make something of
yourself in your otherwise dark future.</font>

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,999
<font color="yellow">What is he talking about?</font>

31
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,900
<font color="yellow">Looks like I got
scared for nothing</font>

32
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,499
<font color="yellow">that something was actually
going on between them.</font>

33
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,100
<font color="yellow">I thought us brothers would
become rivals in love or something.</font>

34
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:06,199
<font color="yellow">Geez! If he was going to help her,
he should've danced better.</font>

35
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,900
<font color="yellow">What's with these moves?</font>

36
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,699
<font color="yellow">If he was going to dance, he should've
busted out cuter moves, like this!</font>

37
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,699
<font color="yellow">Oh, it would've been great if
I'd been there with her instead!</font>

38
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,600
<font color="yellow">How could I kiss such a woman?</font>

39
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,199
<font color="yellow">How could the almighty Jin Jung Seok
lock lips with a woman like that?</font>

40
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,100
<font color="yellow">Why?</font>

41
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,100
<font color="yellow"><i>[wiggler: Thank you so much!]
[notomorrow: Thank you!]</i></font>

42
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,800
<font color="yellow"><i>[letspass: I feel like studying now!]
[addictedtocoffee: Wow! This is awesome!]</i></font>

43
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,199
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin really
helped me out a lot.</font>

44
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,900
<font color="yellow">How am I supposed to
face him tomorrow?</font>

45
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,400
<font color="yellow">Damn it, how could I let that happen?</font>

46
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,800
<font color="yellow"><i>Do you want to search
"how to make beef bone stock?"</i></font>

47
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,699
<font color="yellow">What? This is no time to be
making beef bone stock!</font>

48
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,400
<font color="yellow">What should I do about
my kiss with Professor Jin?</font>

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
<font color="yellow">What do I do about this situation?</font>

50
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,499
<font color="yellow"><i>"Beef shank" is a cut of beef that
is found in the leg of a cow.</i></font>

51
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,100
<font color="yellow">Why, I ought to...</font>

52
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,900
<font color="yellow">If you were a human,
I would've smacked you for that!</font>

53
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,400
<font color="yellow">Why are you going on and on
about cows?</font>

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,905
<font color="yellow">Man, what do I do?</font>

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,199
<font color="yellow">Are you crazy, Bear?
Get the hell away from me!</font>

56
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,199
<font color="yellow">This is driving me crazy!
What do I do?</font>

57
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:07,499
<font color="yellow">It's fine.</font>

58
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,100
<font color="yellow">It was nothing,
Jin Jung Seok.</font>

59
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,400
<font color="yellow">Oh, wait!</font>

60
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,999
<font color="yellow">Um, Professor Jin.</font>

61
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:45,999
<font color="yellow">I hope you don't feel uncomfortable due
to that little mishap from yesterday.</font>

62
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,699
<font color="yellow">Yesterday?
What do you mean?</font>

63
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:53,499
<font color="yellow">Well, yesterday,
the two of us kissed--</font>

64
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,199
<font color="yellow">Um, I mean,
when our lips met by accident.</font>

65
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,400
<font color="yellow">Oh... oh yeah! That happened! Oh, yes.</font>

66
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,900
<font color="yellow">I'd completely forgotten about it.
It was so insignificant, you see.</font>

67
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,499
<font color="yellow">It was kind of like seeing
a fruit fly running into a window.</font>

68
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:08,400
<font color="yellow">A fruit... fly?</font>

69
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,900
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm not implying that
you're a fruit fly, or anything.</font>

70
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,999
<font color="yellow">I'm just saying that what
happened was that insignificant.</font>

71
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:19,999
<font color="yellow">It seems that
it bothered you a lot, though.</font>

72
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:21,300
<font color="yellow">What? Oh, not at all!</font>

73
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,199
<font color="yellow">I'd forgotten about it as well,
and I just remembered when I saw you.</font>

74
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,699
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

75
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,300
<font color="yellow">All right.</font>

76
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,699
<font color="yellow">I've heard that the best public
administration instructor teaches here.</font>

77
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,800
<font color="yellow">Look, a crowd of students on
their way to take Mr. Min's class!</font>

78
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,250
<font color="yellow">Oh my, what's this? They're overcome by
admiration as soon as they see him!</font>

79
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:08,458
<font color="yellow">"VJs on the Scene," right?</font>

80
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,558
<font color="yellow">Oh my, oh my,
oh my, oh my!</font>

81
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:15,002
<font color="yellow">I'm touched that you
figured it out on the first try!</font>

82
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:19,357
<font color="yellow">VJs on the Scene, my ass.
I wish I could call the cops on you.</font>

83
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:22,458
<font color="yellow">Go to your seat already!
You're so annoying.</font>

84
00:08:25,657 --> 00:08:27,257
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, Professor Park!</font>

85
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,357
<font color="yellow">Good work on
your web broadcast yesterday.</font>

86
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,458
<font color="yellow">But what was with Premium Trash?
He even came on the show for you?</font>

87
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,064
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah! I was going to
ask her about that, but forgot.</font>

88
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,257
<font color="yellow">That was incredible!</font>

89
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:40,558
<font color="yellow">He even came
on the show and danced!</font>

90
00:08:40,558 --> 00:08:42,058
<font color="yellow">Who would've imagined it?</font>

91
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:43,757
<font color="yellow">Maybe Premium Trash likes you?</font>

92
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,157
<font color="yellow">What? No way!</font>

93
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,558
<font color="yellow">He said he just helped me
to maintain his joint class's quality.</font>

94
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:52,458
<font color="yellow">No. I think
he definitely has feelings for you.</font>

95
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:57,058
<font color="yellow">At this rate, our academy might
end up with its first instructor couple!</font>

96
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,058
<font color="yellow">Right?
Right?</font>

97
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:04,257
<font color="yellow">If Professor Hwang is right,
I'm overflowing with excitement!</font>

98
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,558
<font color="yellow">Overflowing with excitement!</font>

99
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:07,857
<font color="yellow">I told you, it's nothing like that!
Stop it already, you two!</font>

100
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:09,558
<font color="yellow">Seriously!</font>

101
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,157
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin.
Professor Jin.</font>

102
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:19,857
<font color="yellow">Who are you going to take to the special
lecture you're doing this weekend?</font>

103
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:24,558
<font color="yellow">If you raise our brand awareness, we'll
have more people taking online classes.</font>

104
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:30,157
<font color="yellow">How about bringing one of these three
as a way of promoting the joint class?</font>

105
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:31,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, well... that's what
I was planning to do.</font>

106
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,857
<font color="yellow">You really are the best.</font>

107
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:37,857
<font color="yellow">Let one of these two go this
time instead, Professor Park.</font>

108
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:41,458
<font color="yellow">He already helped you so much
with your web broadcast after all.</font>

109
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:43,657
<font color="yellow">Of course. I wouldn't even
dream of going this time.</font>

110
00:09:43,657 --> 00:09:46,058
<font color="yellow">And I'm not worthy of doing
a special lecture either.</font>

111
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,157
<font color="yellow">Oh, let me make our morning coffee.</font>

112
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:49,157
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

113
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,458
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin!</font>

114
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,058
<font color="yellow">You know that people have rated
my lectures quite highly, right?</font>

115
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:59,157
<font color="yellow">Students just love me so much!</font>

116
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:02,458
<font color="yellow">I think I'd do really well at giving
a special lecture with you.</font>

117
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,958
<font color="yellow">No, I can do it better.
Just look.</font>

118
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:09,058
<font color="yellow">They say that a public administration
instructor who's good at impersonations</font>

119
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:10,357
<font color="yellow">has appeared in Jeolla-do.</font>

120
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:13,558
<font color="yellow">And his name is
Min Jin Woong!</font>

121
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:17,058
<font color="yellow">All types of students studying
for the public servant exams</font>

122
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:22,157
<font color="yellow">have their eyes brimming with tears since
Professor Min's lectures are so funny!</font>

123
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,857
<font color="yellow">You don't know the reference?
I'm impersonating "VJs on the Scene."</font>

124
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,958
<font color="yellow">I do, but why should I care?</font>

125
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,357
<font color="yellow">Man, how embarrassing.</font>

126
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:44,058
<font color="yellow">Professor Min is overflowing with
humiliation because of Professor Jin!</font>

127
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,357
<font color="yellow">Stop it already
with the overflowing!</font>

128
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,458
<font color="yellow">Looks like everyone wants
to come with me no matter what.</font>

129
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,058
<font color="yellow">Well, I'll decide that for myself,
thank you very much!</font>

130
00:10:58,462 --> 00:11:01,462
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which, why does No Geu Rae
not have any ambition whatsoever?</font>

131
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:05,561
<font color="yellow">How is she going to last in Noryangjin
when she's so damn nice?</font>

132
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,561
<font color="yellow">No. It'd be nice if a nice person did
well for themselves, though.</font>

133
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,862
<font color="yellow">But it's awkward with her
because we kissed.</font>

134
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:16,362
<font color="yellow">Why should I let her come with me?</font>

135
00:11:19,362 --> 00:11:23,962
<font color="yellow">Wait, no. I should show her that
people get rewarded for being nice.</font>

136
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,061
<font color="yellow">Hmm, what should I do?</font>

137
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,761
<font color="yellow">This is a serious error:
not using "had" with a past participle.</font>

138
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,561
<font color="yellow">Remember that!</font>

139
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,962
<font color="yellow">All right. That's the end
of today's lecture.</font>

140
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:51,561
<font color="yellow">So make sure you put your hearts into
your dreams and head toward tomorrow!</font>

141
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,161
<font color="yellow">All right?</font>

142
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:54,161
<font color="yellow">- Yes.
- Good luck!</font>

143
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:57,061
<font color="yellow">- Good work, everyone.
- Thank you!</font>

144
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:04,561
<font color="yellow">Wow. She's always been sexy,
but she was super-sexy today!</font>

145
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,862
<font color="yellow">I couldn't keep my eyes off her!</font>

146
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:11,462
<font color="yellow">Ew, my eyes are rotting out!
Noyrangjin's Top Despicable Person!</font>

147
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:12,462
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

148
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,761
<font color="yellow">Why are you picking a fight?</font>

149
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:14,761
<font color="yellow">Yeah!</font>

150
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,962
<font color="yellow">Why are you trying to start something?
She hasn't done anything to you!</font>

151
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:20,362
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Chae Yeon.
I heard you're really good at studying.</font>

152
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,761
<font color="yellow">I heard that you were always
the best at every academy you went to.</font>

153
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:24,061
<font color="yellow">Speaking of which</font>

154
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:25,761
<font color="yellow">could you tutor me?</font>

155
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:29,261
<font color="yellow">You crazy bastard!
Are you out of your damn mind?</font>

156
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,761
<font color="yellow">How could you ask someone
like her to tutor you?</font>

157
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:33,061
<font color="yellow">I have no interest in
doing that either!</font>

158
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:36,261
<font color="yellow">Why, you ask? Because birds
of a feather flock together.</font>

159
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,462
<font color="yellow">A friend of Kim Ki Bum
is no friend of mine.</font>

160
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:42,561
<font color="yellow">Hey, I hate your guts too, all right?</font>

161
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:46,061
<font color="yellow">I'm warning you! One of these days,
someone will knock you down a few pegs!</font>

162
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:48,161
<font color="yellow">I can just tell by
seeing how you act!</font>

163
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:50,962
<font color="yellow">You're the one who
started it first!</font>

164
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:53,261
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you,
she's looking down on me too!</font>

165
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:56,761
<font color="yellow">Hey, what do you have against
Jung Chae Yeon anyway?</font>

166
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:58,362
<font color="yellow">Why do you hate her so much?</font>

167
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:01,261
<font color="yellow">I just hate her, is all!</font>

168
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:04,561
<font color="yellow">Like I hate cockroaches for no reason!
I just hate her too!</font>

169
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:21,171
<font color="yellow">What's the matter, Jin Yi?
Did something happen?</font>

170
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:24,962
<font color="yellow">No, it's nothing.
I'm totally fine.</font>

171
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,261
<font color="yellow">As if.</font>

172
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:29,761
<font color="yellow">She's upset that she's not going
with Professor Jin this weekend.</font>

173
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:34,061
<font color="yellow">No, I'm not! Did you read
my mind or something?</font>

174
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,462
<font color="yellow">Why are you talking about stuff
that you don't even know about?</font>

175
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:41,161
<font color="yellow">Why are you getting mad at me?
I'm upset because I can't go either!</font>

176
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:43,462
<font color="yellow">Neither of you are going?</font>

177
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:46,561
<font color="yellow">Yeah.
You're the one who's going.</font>

178
00:13:46,561 --> 00:13:47,561
<font color="yellow">Me?</font>

179
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,661
<font color="yellow">Yeah. Professor Jin said he might as
well go the extra mile to help you</font>

180
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,962
<font color="yellow">since he helped you
with your web broadcast.</font>

181
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,962
<font color="yellow">He said it's to maintain
the quality of the joint class.</font>

182
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:59,261
<font color="yellow">Wow, you must be so happy,
Professor Park. Seriously.</font>

183
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:05,161
<font color="yellow">Why me? I really didn't
have any intention of going.</font>

184
00:14:05,161 --> 00:14:08,862
<font color="yellow">What? It's good, isn't it?</font>

185
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,761
<font color="yellow">Do your best, okay?
I hope you do well.</font>

186
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:14,862
<font color="yellow">But do you think he keeps on
helping Professor Park</font>

187
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:17,061
<font color="yellow">just to maintain the quality
of the joint class?</font>

188
00:14:17,061 --> 00:14:20,362
<font color="yellow">I think that Premium Trash
really must like you.</font>

189
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:23,061
<font color="yellow">At this rate, you two may become a couple
just like Professor Hwang predicted.</font>

190
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,462
<font color="yellow">- Right, Professor Hwang?
- I don't know.</font>

191
00:14:24,462 --> 00:14:26,362
<font color="yellow">I don't know, damn it!</font>

192
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:31,261
<font color="yellow">If I was that good at predicting things,
I'd be Nostradamus, not Hwang Jin Yi!</font>

193
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,462
<font color="yellow">Damn, you piss me off!</font>

194
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,761
<font color="yellow">Ugh, I'm so pissed.</font>

195
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,862
<font color="yellow">Wait, Jin Yi. I--</font>

196
00:14:36,862 --> 00:14:39,362
<font color="yellow">What's with her?
She definitely said that before.</font>

197
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:45,761
<font color="yellow">I'm overflowing with anger too.
I'll drown myself in soju.</font>

198
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,862
<font color="yellow">Bye!</font>

199
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,661
<font color="yellow">- Goodbye.
- All right.</font>

200
00:15:04,261 --> 00:15:10,561
<font color="yellow">What's with him?
Does he really like me?</font>

201
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:16,161
<font color="yellow">Shut up, you crazy girl.
Don't get started with that again.</font>

202
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:19,061
<font color="yellow">You thought he did last time
and were totally humiliated for it.</font>

203
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,862
<font color="yellow">Let's just get packed for
the trip this weekend.</font>

204
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,061
<font color="yellow">Get it together!</font>

205
00:15:25,362 --> 00:15:27,462
<font color="yellow">Why are you hitting
my woman's face?</font>

206
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:30,362
<font color="yellow">What did you say?
"My woman"?</font>

207
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,362
<font color="yellow">Why, you little...</font>

208
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,761
<font color="yellow">Are you just heading home now?</font>

209
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,462
<font color="yellow">Oh, I'll walk you home
so you won't be bored.</font>

210
00:15:35,462 --> 00:15:37,761
<font color="yellow">You don't have the luxury of worrying
about me being bored right now.</font>

211
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:38,761
<font color="yellow">Go and get some studying done.</font>

212
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:42,161
<font color="yellow">Whoa. If you're telling me to go study,
you want me to hurry and pass</font>

213
00:15:42,161 --> 00:15:44,261
<font color="yellow">and become your boyfriend!</font>

214
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:45,661
<font color="yellow">What'd you say?</font>

215
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:50,761
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, Teach. Why didn't you tell me
that you'd be doing the web broadcast?</font>

216
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:53,462
<font color="yellow">I only saw it later on
and I was really disappointed!</font>

217
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:56,561
<font color="yellow">Why? It was just to encourage you
to get more studying done.</font>

218
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:59,362
<font color="yellow">Oh, so what you're saying is you
wanted me to not watch the program</font>

219
00:15:59,362 --> 00:16:02,061
<font color="yellow">and study hard so I can hurry
and become your boyfriend!</font>

220
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,462
<font color="yellow">- You're just asking for a scolding!
- Ow!</font>

221
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:12,161
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah, Professor.</font>

222
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,761
<font color="yellow">Don't get too close to this guy.</font>

223
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,661
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

224
00:16:16,661 --> 00:16:21,362
<font color="yellow">Something about his face irks me
and he seems like a real asshole.</font>

225
00:16:21,362 --> 00:16:24,161
<font color="yellow">So... don't get too
close to him, okay?</font>

226
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,661
<font color="yellow">Geez.</font>

227
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:30,662
<font color="yellow">There's nothing to worry about.
He's the best of the best in Noryangjin.</font>

228
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:34,361
<font color="yellow">He's on a completely different
plane of existence than I am.</font>

229
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,861
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's here!
I'll get going then.</font>

230
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,662
<font color="yellow">Get home safe, Professor!</font>

231
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,561
<font color="yellow">I'm really going to pass!
Just wait for me!</font>

232
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,761
<font color="yellow">The hell are you looking at?</font>

233
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,061
<font color="yellow">You really are an asshole,
just like your name says.</font>

234
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,398
<font color="yellow">Well, look who it is!
It's Noryangjin's Top Despicable Person!</font>

235
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:18,800
<font color="yellow">If you came all the way to Noryangjin
to study, you should be studying.</font>

236
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,598
<font color="yellow">So why do you have a jump rope?</font>

237
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:24,300
<font color="yellow">Don't you know that keeping fit is
the most important thing for studying?</font>

238
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,898
<font color="yellow">Get out of my way.</font>

239
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:28,300
<font color="yellow">Why, you--</font>

240
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,869
<font color="yellow">Watch your back.
Seriously.</font>

241
00:17:32,002 --> 00:17:34,480
<font color="yellow">"Don't you know that keeping fit is
the most important thing for studying?"</font>

242
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,000
<font color="yellow">All right. I've done enough prepping
for the special lecture today.</font>

243
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,398
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. What should I wear?</font>

244
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,000
<font color="yellow">No, this is boring.</font>

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,200
<font color="yellow">The most refined look that
I can pull out of this closet is...</font>

246
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
<font color="yellow">What?
Don't get it wrong, okay?</font>

247
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,098
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this to look good in front of
the students, not Professor Jin!</font>

248
00:19:08,367 --> 00:19:09,367
<font color="yellow"><i>[Premium Trash]</i></font>

249
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,000
<font color="yellow">Yes, Professor Jin?</font>

250
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:15,306
<font color="yellow">What?
Where did you say you were?</font>

251
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,598
<font color="yellow">You didn't have to
come pick me up.</font>

252
00:19:25,098 --> 00:19:28,800
<font color="yellow">What if you were late because
you took public transportation?</font>

253
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,000
<font color="yellow">That would definitely tarnish
the image of my joint class.</font>

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,898
<font color="yellow">I only came to get you to
maintain the quality of my joint class.</font>

255
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:35,598
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it for you.</font>

256
00:19:35,598 --> 00:19:37,300
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

257
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
<font color="yellow">Wow, what a nice view!</font>

258
00:19:56,398 --> 00:19:59,398
<font color="yellow">I just wanted you to get a proper look
at the view since you're so into it.</font>

259
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,000
<font color="yellow">Thank you! You even took
the top down for me!</font>

260
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,398
<font color="yellow">It wasn't for you.
It was for my joint class.</font>

261
00:20:04,398 --> 00:20:08,000
<font color="yellow">You'll give a better lecture
if you relax while taking in the view.</font>

262
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,598
<font color="yellow">It was just to maintain
the quality of my joint class.</font>

263
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:11,500
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

264
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,099
<font color="yellow">Wow, it's Wine Cave!
So it is around here, huh?</font>

265
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,599
<font color="yellow">- Wine Cave?
- Yes.</font>

266
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,800
<font color="yellow">I saw it on TV. There's a wine cellar in
the cave and you can take photos there.</font>

267
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,300
<font color="yellow">It's really nice.</font>

268
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,198
<font color="yellow">Don't you want to go
since you're interested in alcohol too?</font>

269
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:29,800
<font color="yellow">No. I hate crowded places.</font>

270
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,099
<font color="yellow">You didn't come with me
to have fun, you know.</font>

271
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,800
<font color="yellow">Just focus on giving a good lecture!</font>

272
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,398
<font color="yellow">Don't worry. I really did my best
when planning this lecture.</font>

273
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:42,300
<font color="yellow">I want you to see me
giving a good lecture.</font>

274
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, I shouldn't be doing this.
I should review my materials.</font>

275
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,300
<font color="yellow">What? The special lecture
for today is canceled?</font>

276
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,800
<font color="yellow">We have a problem with
the electricity at our academy today</font>

277
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,398
<font color="yellow">so they're doing some
emergency construction.</font>

278
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,398
<font color="yellow">That's why it's canceled.</font>

279
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,800
<font color="yellow">Then you should've contacted us sooner!</font>

280
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,599
<font color="yellow">How could you handle this
situation in such a lackluster way?</font>

281
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:15,500
<font color="yellow">My time is money, you know!
I'm Jin Jung Seok!</font>

282
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,800
<font color="yellow">Yes, I know, sir. That's why I definitely
told the director in Seoul to tell you.</font>

283
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
<font color="yellow">I guess he forgot.</font>

284
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,698
<font color="yellow">- Director?
- Be right there!</font>

285
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:28,000
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry.
Just a moment.</font>

286
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,099
<font color="yellow">Ugh, seriously?</font>

287
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,898
<font color="yellow">I'll go and give that director an earful,
so don't worry too much.</font>

288
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,398
<font color="yellow">I'll make sure we get compensated for
wasting a day here no matter what.</font>

289
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:42,800
<font color="yellow">That's not it.</font>

290
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,599
<font color="yellow">It's just that I put a lot
into planning my lesson.</font>

291
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:46,099
<font color="yellow">I just feel a bit disappointed
because of that.</font>

292
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:49,198
<font color="yellow">I really did give it my all.</font>

293
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
<font color="yellow"><i>[Have a heart, please! Don't stow
away all the food in your rooms!]</i></font>

294
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
<font color="yellow"><i>[You all are future public servants!
You need to have a sense of justice!]</i></font>

295
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,898
<font color="yellow">- Oh, my back.
- Did you study a lot?</font>

296
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,500
<font color="yellow">Oh, I don't know.</font>

297
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:24,325
<font color="yellow">Oh yeah. Did you see this photo?</font>

298
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:29,599
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I saw it on the study forum.
It's spread like wildfire online.</font>

299
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,898
<font color="yellow">Wow, I can't believe it. Who'd do
this to Noryangjin's Top Beauty?</font>

300
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,898
<font color="yellow">Right? Seriously.</font>

301
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:35,898
<font color="yellow">What's that?</font>

302
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,300
<font color="yellow">Here, look.
Isn't this insane?</font>

303
00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:44,500
<font color="yellow">Isn't this Jung Chae Yeon?</font>

304
00:22:55,698 --> 00:23:01,300
<font color="yellow">So someone put this on Godeung,
but others spread it elsewhere.</font>

305
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,000
<font color="yellow">Godeung? Oh, you mean that site
where they upload upskirt shots of girls?</font>

306
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,599
<font color="yellow">But who'd upload this?</font>

307
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,698
<font color="yellow">Look here, at the title.</font>

308
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:14,198
<font color="yellow">"This is my revenge against
Jung Chae Yeon, who rejected me."</font>

309
00:23:14,198 --> 00:23:16,898
<font color="yellow">"You told me to study if I came
all the way to Noryangjin to do so."</font>

310
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:19,898
<font color="yellow">"You came here to study too, but how
about giving Internet stardom a shot?"</font>

311
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:24,398
<font color="yellow">It's clear that someone who got
rejected big-time by her did this.</font>

312
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:26,898
<font color="yellow">So who is it, exactly?</font>

313
00:23:26,898 --> 00:23:29,898
<font color="yellow">There's a whole ton of guys
who got dumped by her!</font>

314
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,599
<font color="yellow">But anyway, I wonder if
Chae Yeon knows about this.</font>

315
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,000
<font color="yellow">She'll be totally shocked
if she finds out.</font>

316
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we let her know
and report this?</font>

317
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,398
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

318
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,599
<font color="yellow">What are you talking
about exactly?</font>

319
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,898
<font color="yellow">- Um, nothing.
- Nothing.</font>

320
00:23:45,898 --> 00:23:47,599
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

321
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,800
<font color="yellow">- Hey...
- No!</font>

322
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,099
<font color="yellow">What the hell is this?</font>

323
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,800
<font color="yellow">Why are we here
at Wine Cave?</font>

324
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,599
<font color="yellow">It seemed that you were disappointed
because your lecture got canceled</font>

325
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,099
<font color="yellow">so I brought you here
to cheer you up.</font>

326
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,398
<font color="yellow">And it seemed like you wanted
to visit this place too.</font>

327
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:22,398
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

328
00:24:22,398 --> 00:24:24,198
<font color="yellow">If you stay disappointed,
you'll be in a bad mood.</font>

329
00:24:24,198 --> 00:24:27,300
<font color="yellow">And if you do, you'll bring down
the mood of the entire joint class.</font>

330
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,398
<font color="yellow">So get in a better mood
and lecture well.</font>

331
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:32,300
<font color="yellow">Thank you! You're going to
such lengths for me?</font>

332
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,198
<font color="yellow">Who said that
I'm doing this for you?</font>

333
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:35,599
<font color="yellow">I'm doing this
for the sake of my joint class!</font>

334
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,198
<font color="yellow">I brought you here to maintain
the quality of my joint class!</font>

335
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:41,000
<font color="yellow">Well, either way, thank you!</font>

336
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
<font color="yellow">She's that happy over it?</font>

337
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,099
<font color="yellow">Geez.
She's so tacky.</font>

338
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,300
<font color="yellow">Whoa!
This is so cool!</font>

339
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,500
<font color="yellow">But why do they have
a wine cellar in a cave?</font>

340
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,898
<font color="yellow">It's best to keep wine between
10 to 14 degrees Celsius</font>

341
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:17,099
<font color="yellow">and a cave maintains that
temperature 365 days of the year.</font>

342
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:20,300
<font color="yellow">Wow, there's nothing that
you don't know, Professor Jin!</font>

343
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,198
<font color="yellow">Yes. I'm fascinated by
that fact as well.</font>

344
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,300
<font color="yellow">It's kind of cold in here.
I guess because it's a cave.</font>

345
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,599
<font color="yellow">Here.
Put it on.</font>

346
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:39,198
<font color="yellow">- Um, what?
- I'm quite hot!</font>

347
00:25:39,198 --> 00:25:44,000
<font color="yellow">Wearing this jacket is bothering me,
so wear this in my stead.</font>

348
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,599
<font color="yellow">- Is... that okay?
- It's fine if you don't want to.</font>

349
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:47,300
<font color="yellow">Wait, no!</font>

350
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,500
<font color="yellow">Geez. You're so frustrating.</font>

351
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,000
<font color="yellow">Make sure you button
it up too, okay?</font>

352
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,898
<font color="yellow">Thank you.</font>

353
00:26:20,898 --> 00:26:23,300
<font color="yellow">You think I'm doing this for you?</font>

354
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,800
<font color="yellow">This is all
for the sake of my joint class!</font>

355
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,398
<font color="yellow">If you catch a cold
and keep sniffling</font>

356
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,398
<font color="yellow">the quality of your
lecture may go down!</font>

357
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:30,800
<font color="yellow">This is all for the sake of maintaining
the quality of my joint class.</font>

358
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,000
<font color="yellow">Got that?</font>

359
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
<font color="yellow">Okay.</font>

360
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,599
<font color="yellow">Oh, it's cold.</font>

361
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,898
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

362
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,099
<font color="yellow">I wonder if Jung Chae Yeon
reported this to the authorities?</font>

363
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,398
<font color="yellow">What's she going to do?
I bet she's really shocked.</font>

364
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:04,300
<font color="yellow">Hey, Kim Ki Bum!
Give me your phone.</font>

365
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
<font color="yellow">My phone? Why?</font>

366
00:27:10,898 --> 00:27:12,300
<font color="yellow">It was you, wasn't it?</font>

367
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,599
<font color="yellow">I knew it was you,
you evil bastard.</font>

368
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,599
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

369
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,898
<font color="yellow">You're the one who took those photos
and videos of me and put them online!</font>

370
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:18,500
<font color="yellow">Are you out of your damn mind?
What are you talking about?</font>

371
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,198
<font color="yellow">I looked at the metadata to see
what phone took those photos.</font>

372
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:26,800
<font color="yellow">Figures. You're stupid, so you
probably didn't even know about this.</font>

373
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
<font color="yellow">But you know, the phone that took these
photos is the same model as yours!</font>

374
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,099
<font color="yellow">You think that I'm the only one
with a Samsung phone?</font>

375
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:34,500
<font color="yellow">You seriously think
I'm the only one with this model?</font>

376
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,198
<font color="yellow">Hey, hey.
Calm down, Chae Yeon.</font>

377
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:41,398
<font color="yellow">You two may be on bad terms, but it's
not so bad that he'd do this to you.</font>

378
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,599
<font color="yellow">Yeah. The guy who did this has a huge
grudge because you rejected him.</font>

379
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,398
<font color="yellow">It's definitely not Ki Bum.</font>

380
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,800
<font color="yellow">That's why it has to be him.
I did reject him once, big-time.</font>

381
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,500
<font color="yellow"><i>[One Year Ago]</i></font>

382
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,698
<font color="yellow">Hey, Noryangjin's Top Beauty!</font>

383
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,898
<font color="yellow">Wait up.</font>

384
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:27,898
<font color="yellow">Take this.</font>

385
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,099
<font color="yellow">What's with him?
That looked like it hurt.</font>

386
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,398
<font color="yellow">Does it not hurt?</font>

387
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,898
<font color="yellow">So he was doing this
instead of taking the exam?</font>

388
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:57,198
<font color="yellow">What a disgrace.</font>

389
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,599
<font color="yellow">If he came all the way to Noryangjin,
he should focus on studying.</font>

390
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,198
<font color="yellow">Damn it.
Why hasn't she responded?</font>

391
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,599
<font color="yellow">Hey, did you see
the post on the forum?</font>

392
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,633
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about?</font>

393
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:33,300
<font color="yellow">It's the top post there right now.

396
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:41,300
<font color="yellow">It's so funny.</font>

397
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:43,099
<font color="yellow">Look.</font>

398
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:51,300
<font color="yellow">"Hi, Jung Chae Yeon. I keep thinking
about you, so I can't study good (sic)."</font>

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,198
<font color="yellow">"You're making such quickly (sic)
progression in your studying, though."</font>

400
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,800
<font color="yellow">"I wonder if it's okay
for me to like you"</font>

401
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
<font color="yellow">"but I'm actually quite a good
guy once you get to know me."</font>

402

<font color="yellow">"I'm not a (sic) old-fashion (sic)
type of guy, either."</font>

403
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,599
<font color="yellow">"I want to become your boyfriend."</font>

404
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,300
<font color="yellow">"I'll always make you smile.
I'll be sure to keep this promise."</font>

Don't keep me waiting too long."</font>

407
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:28,898
<font color="yellow">"No, this isn't the time for me to
be bossy (sic) people around."</font>

408
00:30:28,898 --> 00:30:30,599
<font color="yellow">"Just don't reject me, please."</font>

409
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,398
<font color="yellow">"Naver! (sic)"</font>

410
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:38,198
<font color="yellow">Isn't this so funny?</font>

411
00:30:38,198 --> 00:30:40,698
<font color="yellow">This is the funniest part, though.</font>

412
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:42,000
<font color="yellow">"A man's world (sic)
is as good as his bond, after all."</font>

413
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,599
<font color="yellow">How could anyone make
this kind of mistake?</font>

414
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:49,898
<font color="yellow">I mean, what is he even saying here?</font>

415
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,398
<font color="yellow">Well, come on. That's a mistake
that anyone could've made.</font>

416
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,898
<font color="yellow">What are you talking about? This idiot
lives somewhere in Noryangjin, though.</font>

417
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:00,099
<font color="yellow">- I really want to meet him just once!
- I know, right?</font>

418
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,898
<font color="yellow">What a freaking idiot!</font>

419
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,800
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Chae Yeon!</font>

420
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,099
<font color="yellow">You and I need to talk.</font>

421
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,599
<font color="yellow">What do you want?</font>

422
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:20,800
<font color="yellow">Ew, you reek of alcohol!
Did you drink?</font>

423
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,898
<font color="yellow">Yeah. I did. What, the Idiot of
Noryangjin isn't allowed to drink?</font>

424
00:31:25,898 --> 00:31:29,898
<font color="yellow">- What?
- How could you upload my letter online?</font>

425
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:32,300
<font color="yellow">It's all over the web now!</font>

426
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,000
<font color="yellow">My feelings of true love are now in
the running for a prize in "Best Humor"!</font>

427
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,898
<font color="yellow">Hey, I didn't upload that.</font>

428
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,898
<font color="yellow">I guess someone took what
I threw away and put it online--</font>

429
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:45,300
<font color="yellow">You threw it in the trash?
In the trash?</font>

430
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,800
<font color="yellow">How could you trample all
over my feelings like that?</font>

431
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,300
<font color="yellow">What's wrong with me?
Why do you hate me so much?</font>

432
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,698
<font color="yellow">I just do! Just like how people
naturally don't like roaches!</font>

433
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,398
<font color="yellow">Evil girl.</font>

434
00:31:57,398 --> 00:31:59,398
<font color="yellow">I'll hate you forever!</font>

435
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:01,898
<font color="yellow">I'll curse you forever!</font>

436
00:32:01,898 --> 00:32:03,099
<font color="yellow">Sure. Whatever.</font>

437
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:08,800
<font color="yellow">At any rate, sorry for making you
become Noryangjin's Idiot.</font>

438
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
<font color="yellow">If you're sorry, then keep this a secret.</font>

439
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,099
<font color="yellow">Keep the fact that I gave you
a love letter, got rejected</font>

440
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,398
<font color="yellow">and became Noryangjin's Idiot a secret!</font>

441
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:20,599
<font color="yellow">Keep all of this a secret!
If you don't...</font>

442
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,300
<font color="yellow">I'll feel way too humiliated!</font>

443
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,198
<font color="yellow">All right, already.</font>

444
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:29,300
<font color="yellow">If you came all the way to Noryangjin,
stop doing such stupid things</font>

445
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,099
<font color="yellow">and study so that you'll pass the exam.</font>

446
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,898
<font color="yellow">Hey.</font>

447
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,599
<font color="yellow">I didn't make all those grammatical
mistakes because my grammar sucks!</font>

448
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,398
<font color="yellow">I just made those mistakes
on purpose to make you laugh!</font>

449
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:51,099
<font color="yellow">Okay, it's true that I didn't know
the "a man's word" idiom.</font>

450
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,599
<font color="yellow">Happy?</font>

451
00:32:57,198 --> 00:33:00,000
<font color="yellow">Then you were Noryangjin's Idiot?</font>

452
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,286
<font color="yellow"><i>Keep the secret.</i></font>

453
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,379
<font color="yellow"><i>I had feelings for you
and wrote you letters.</i></font>

454
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:06,379
<font color="yellow"><i>I was rejected.</i></font>

455
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,349
<font color="yellow"><i>I became Noryangjin's Idiot.</i></font>

456
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,839
<font color="yellow"><i>Keep all of this a secret!</i></font>

457
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:10,839
<font color="yellow"><i>If you don't...</i></font>

458
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,846
<font color="yellow"><i>I'll feel way too humiliated!</i></font>

459
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:24,409
<font color="yellow">Still it's not you?</font>

460
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:27,020
<font color="yellow">You're the one who hates
me the most in Noryangjin.</font>

461
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,430
<font color="yellow">You said you'd hate me
for the rest of your life.</font>

462
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,550
<font color="yellow">You said you'd put a curse on me.</font>

463
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,948
<font color="yellow">Only a few days ago, you said
you'd watch me go down.</font>

464
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,569
<font color="yellow">No. I'm saying it's not me.</font>

465
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:36,010
<font color="yellow">Agreed. When you're not positive</font>

466
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,486
<font color="yellow">you can't just go at him like that.</font>

467
00:33:38,943 --> 00:33:40,769
<font color="yellow">This was taken right after
we ran into each other.</font>

468
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:43,334
<font color="yellow">He was the only one I saw that night.
Will you still deny it?</font>

469
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:45,330
<font color="yellow">Why not look into my phone folder?</font>

470
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,761
<font color="yellow">Take a look to see
if I have your photos or not.</font>

471
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:54,580
<font color="yellow">What is it?</font>

472
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:03,959
<font color="yellow">Gosh, this punk has narcissistic
photos of himself only.</font>

473
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:04,959
<font color="yellow">I agree.</font>

474
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:06,709
<font color="yellow">There aren't any of your photos here.</font>

475
00:34:06,709 --> 00:34:08,499
<font color="yellow">I'm sure he's already deleted them all.</font>

476
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,339
<font color="yellow">If you were him, would you
have left clear evidence like that?</font>

477
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:12,490
<font color="yellow">Let's go to the police station.</font>

478
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,580
<font color="yellow">If they restore all the deleted photos,
the truth will come out.</font>

479
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,970
<font color="yellow">I said, it wasn't me.</font>

480
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,330
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it.</font>

481
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,544
<font color="yellow">Watch me.</font>

482
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,390
<font color="yellow">I will find the evidence.</font>

483
00:34:22,046 --> 00:34:23,046
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

484
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,100
<font color="yellow">Oh my god!</font>

485
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:37,361
<font color="yellow">Director Kim.</font>

486
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,459
<font color="yellow">Professor Min, there you are.</font>

487
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,792
<font color="yellow">Have a seat.</font>

488
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,530
<font color="yellow">I was surprised that you asked
me out here out of the blue.</font>

489
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,060
<font color="yellow">By the way,
why hiking suddenly?</font>

490
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,399
<font color="yellow">It's the weekend and all.
I just didn't want to stay home.</font>

491
00:34:50,401 --> 00:34:53,490
<font color="yellow">As you already know,
my in-laws are living with me.</font>

492
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:57,370
<font color="yellow">My in-laws helped me start the academy.</font>

493
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,397
<font color="yellow">So they've been bossing me around.</font>

494
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:01,919
<font color="yellow">It's the weekend and all,
so I just wanted to relax.</font>

495
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,280
<font color="yellow">They were asking me questions
about the profits and all.</font>

496
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,126
<font color="yellow">I just had enough.</font>

497
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:08,694
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

498
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:12,019
<font color="yellow">We were watching TV on the sofa.</font>

499
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:15,100
<font color="yellow">Some funny scene came on
and I started to laugh.</font>

500
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,917
<font color="yellow">Then they asked if I could laugh
when the academy isn't doing well.</font>

501
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:21,879
<font color="yellow">So they started grilling me on and on.</font>

502
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:24,109
<font color="yellow">Shouldn't we relax on weekends?</font>

503
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:26,180
<font color="yellow">If they grill me about work
even on weekends</font>

504
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,459
<font color="yellow">what am I supposed to do, huh?</font>

505
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,109
<font color="yellow">Gosh, it sucks big time.</font>

506
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:33,600
<font color="yellow">Oh my, it must have been hard.</font>

507
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,379
<font color="yellow">No matter how often I talk about this</font>

508
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:37,379
<font color="yellow">you will never know how I feel.</font>

509
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,539
<font color="yellow">I have to work on weekends.</font>

510
00:35:42,149 --> 00:35:44,539
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I feel suffocated.</font>

511
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:46,180
<font color="yellow">Let's hike, shall we?</font>

512
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,319
<font color="yellow">Wow, I feel alive now that
my in-laws are not grilling me.</font>

513
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,910
<font color="yellow">We should take a break
on weekends like this.</font>

514
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,189
<font color="yellow">Why would they talk about work
even on weekends, huh?</font>

515
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,819
<font color="yellow">- I agree.
- By the way</font>

516
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,850
<font color="yellow">how come you're not
impersonating anyone today?</font>

517
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:16,379
<font color="yellow">"Now that we're hiking,
my sweat is overflowing!"</font>

518
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:19,339
<font color="yellow">"Endorphins are overflowing!"
Don't you do anything like that?</font>

519
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:21,129
<font color="yellow">I have no lecture today.</font>

520
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:23,629
<font color="yellow">I should take a break on weekends too.</font>

521
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:24,899
<font color="yellow">I should take it easy on my throat too.</font>

522
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:28,870
<font color="yellow">Wow, someone might think
you're such a popular instructor.</font>

523
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,749
<font color="yellow">You know that only 50 students signed up</font>

524
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:33,280
<font color="yellow">to take your class this month, right?</font>

525
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,990
<font color="yellow">It's not the time
to take it easy on your throat.</font>

526
00:36:36,499 --> 00:36:37,990
<font color="yellow">What are you doing? Let's go.</font>

527
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,359
<font color="yellow">Director Kim.</font>

528
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:42,069
<font color="yellow">Will you climb up to the top?</font>

529
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:44,760
<font color="yellow">I haven't hiked
for a while, so...</font>

530
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,669
<font color="yellow">I'm already feeling so exhausted.</font>

531
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:50,589
<font color="yellow">If I wait here for you,
I would be bothering you less.</font>

532
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,569
<font color="yellow">- Professor Min, that's your problem.
- What?</font>

533
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:55,760
<font color="yellow">You don't ever seem
desperate to achieve anything.</font>

534
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,410
<font color="yellow">When you don't have
many students signing up</font>

535
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,229
<font color="yellow">you don't seem to bother
trying to increase the number.</font>

536
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:02,039
<font color="yellow">I guess
you're at peace with the situation.</font>

537
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:04,740
<font color="yellow">But as your employer,
I'm having a hard time.</font>

538
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,439
<font color="yellow">Please be desperate, please.</font>

539
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,780
<font color="yellow">I'm done taking a break.
Let's climb to the top.</font>

540
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,990
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

541
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,280
<font color="yellow">If you had done so from the beginning,
wouldn't I have been happier?</font>

542
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,560
<font color="yellow">As I already told you</font>

543
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,629
<font color="yellow">because of my in-laws who talk
about work even on weekends</font>

544
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:26,990
<font color="yellow">I'm so stressed out.</font>

545
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,180
<font color="yellow">No matter how often I talk about this</font>

546
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,760
<font color="yellow">you will never know how I feel.</font>

547
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,970
<font color="yellow">I work even on weekends.</font>

548
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,979
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I will never know for sure.</font>

549
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,479
<font color="yellow">Director Kim.</font>

550
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,019
<font color="yellow">Wow, this tastes so good.</font>

551
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:03,580
<font color="yellow">What language is this?</font>

552
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,129
<font color="yellow">How should I read it?</font>

553
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,620
<font color="yellow">It looks like Spanish.</font>

554
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:24,839
<font color="yellow">I see.</font>

555
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:28,240
<font color="yellow">It means "red roses" in Spanish.</font>

556
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,850
<font color="yellow">Red roses?</font>

557
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,979
<font color="yellow">That's really amazing.</font>

558
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,709
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin, have some.</font>

559
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:40,080
<font color="yellow">I have to drive.</font>

560
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,180
<font color="yellow">- You can drink for me instead.
- Okay.</font>

561
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:55,229
<font color="yellow">I usually like eating junk food,
chocolate, candy, and anything sweet.</font>

562
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,709
<font color="yellow">Strangely, I don't like sweet wine.</font>

563
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:00,010
<font color="yellow">I'm the same way.</font>

564
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,899
<font color="yellow">Rather than sweet sparkling
wine or white wine</font>

565
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:04,629
<font color="yellow">dry red wine is more for my taste.</font>

566
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:06,010
<font color="yellow">Wow, me too!</font>

567
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,910
<font color="yellow">What's with this tacky gesture?</font>

568
00:39:23,939 --> 00:39:25,740
<font color="yellow">Wow, this tastes really good.</font>

569
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,200
<font color="yellow">Should I buy one bottle?</font>

570
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,220
<font color="yellow">- What's wrong?
- No, it's too expensive.</font>

571
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,600
<font color="yellow">I will get it
when I celebrate something special.</font>

572
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,720
<font color="yellow">I will go to the bathroom.</font>

573
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
<font color="yellow">What was that?</font>

574
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,089
<font color="yellow">Was she shocked by a mere 30,000?</font>

575
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,600
<font color="yellow">She may faint again if she sees
wine that costs 300,000 then.</font>

576
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,149
<font color="yellow">So tacky, gosh.</font>

577
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,100
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

578
00:40:05,499 --> 00:40:08,600
<font color="yellow">I don't know
what you will be celebrating.</font>

579
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,649
<font color="yellow">But drink it when you get to.</font>

580
00:40:14,006 --> 00:40:16,560
<font color="yellow">Wow, thank you.
You got it for me?</font>

581
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,269
<font color="yellow">I didn't get it for you.</font>

582
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:19,999
<font color="yellow">It's all for my joint class.</font>

583
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,339
<font color="yellow">If you keep regretting not buying
the wine when you get to Seoul</font>

584
00:40:22,339 --> 00:40:24,180
<font color="yellow">you will have a hard time
focusing on your lecture.</font>

585
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,180
<font color="yellow">This is to manage my joint class better.</font>

586
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,459
<font color="yellow">Professor Jin.</font>

587
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,499
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

588
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,850
<font color="yellow">When we get to Seoul,
you'll go drink solo again, won't you?</font>

589
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,109
<font color="yellow">Can't you come with me to drink?</font>

590
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,760
<font color="yellow">I want to take you out for a drink.</font>

591
00:40:39,249 --> 00:40:41,080
<font color="yellow">- Why should you?
- It's just that</font>

592
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,289
<font color="yellow">I want to thank you for a lot of things.</font>

593
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,680
<font color="yellow">It's for our joint class, not for you.</font>

594
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,260
<font color="yellow">I mean... after you've done a lot for me</font>

595
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,600
<font color="yellow">you will feel less appreciated
if I don't take you out.</font>

596
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,439
<font color="yellow">Then it will affect the teamwork
of our joint class.</font>

597
00:40:54,439 --> 00:40:56,310
<font color="yellow">To manage our joint class better...</font>

598
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,169
<font color="yellow">After you've done a lot for me</font>

599
00:41:01,169 --> 00:41:03,490
<font color="yellow">you will feel less appreciated
if I don't take you out.</font>

600
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:06,310
<font color="yellow">Then it will affect the teamwork
of our joint class.</font>

601
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,450
<font color="yellow">To manage our joint class better...</font>

602
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:15,080
<font color="yellow">Nothing. Just forget I said anything.</font>

603
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,939
<font color="yellow">Don't worry about it.</font>

604
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,490
<font color="yellow">Let's go get a drink.</font>

605
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,269
<font color="yellow">- What?
- I said let's go get a drink.</font>

606
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:22,890
<font color="yellow">You actually have a good point.</font>

607
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,669
<font color="yellow">What's happening to him?</font>

608
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,899
<font color="yellow">Gosh, you've hated
Chae Yeon all these years.</font>

609
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,589
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it all came out.</font>

610
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:44,709
<font color="yellow">Hey, how can you say that now?</font>

611
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:47,129
<font color="yellow">I've been accused of
recording her secretly.</font>

612
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:51,220
<font color="yellow">Gosh, how can I prove my innocence?</font>

613
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:54,950
<font color="yellow">What's up with you?</font>

614
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,209
<font color="yellow">What's with the way you're looking at me?</font>

615
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,979
<font color="yellow">Well, actually...</font>

616
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:02,220
<font color="yellow">I loved reading
"The Love of a Noryangjin Idiot."</font>

617
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,899
<font color="yellow">I really wanted
to meet that fool.</font>

618
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:09,930
<font color="yellow">I can't believe it was you, my friend,
who's been hanging out with me.</font>

619
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,450
<font color="yellow">What do you call this?</font>

620
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:14,180
<font color="yellow">You know, the feeling that I became
close to a celebrity and such.</font>

621
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:17,209
<font color="yellow">Crazy punk.</font>

622
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:18,613
<font color="yellow">Stop teasing me.</font>

623
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:24,879
<font color="yellow">Don't tell me what to do.</font>

624
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:26,359
<font color="yellow">You punk, seriously.</font>

625
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:32,399
<font color="yellow">You believe I'm innocent, right?</font>

626
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:35,560
<font color="yellow">I didn't do it. It really wasn't me.</font>

627
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,249
<font color="yellow">Sure, if a man says
he didn't do it, he didn't do it.</font>

628
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:40,149
<font color="yellow">A man's word is as good as a bond.</font>

629
00:42:40,149 --> 00:42:42,100
<font color="yellow">You punk, seriously!</font>

630
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,649
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry. I will not tease you again.</font>

631
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,700
<font color="yellow">Naver!</font>

632
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,479
<font color="yellow">Do you want to die? Come here!</font>

633
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:51,760
<font color="yellow">You bastard!</font>

634
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,310
<font color="yellow">Hey, you two. Stop it already.</font>

635
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,609
<font color="yellow">I have to take an online class.</font>

636
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,990
<font color="yellow">What are you looking at, creeps?</font>

637
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:14,740
<font color="yellow">Gosh, don't worry about it.</font>

638
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,350
<font color="yellow">Now that I'm in Noryangjin,
I should just study.</font>

639
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,720
<font color="yellow">I should just pass
the exams as soon as possible.</font>

640
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,569
<font color="yellow">And leave this place.</font>

641
00:43:22,919 --> 00:43:25,890
<font color="yellow">Jung Chae Yeon, are you feeling better?</font>

642
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,419
<font color="yellow">- Did you report the incident?
- Never mind.</font>

643
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,109
<font color="yellow">It's understandable that you're on edge.</font>

644
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,780
<font color="yellow">You!</font>

645
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:17,789
<font color="yellow">It's you who posted the photos, isn't it?</font>

646
00:44:37,176 --> 00:44:38,269
<font color="yellow">Who are you?</font>

647
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,160
<font color="yellow">Hi, Jung Chae Yeon.</font>

648
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,030
<font color="yellow">If you're free this weekend,
want to have dinner with me?</font>

649
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:58,589
<font color="yellow">Wow, it was very good for my soul to
climb the mountain on the weekend.</font>

650
00:44:58,589 --> 00:45:01,470
<font color="yellow">- Wasn't it?
- Agreed. I liked it.</font>

651
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:06,830
<font color="yellow">It's weird. Why can't I see
the chicken neck in here?</font>

652
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:09,499
<font color="yellow">What? I already ate it.</font>

653
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:10,700
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

654
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,720
<font color="yellow">Damn it. It was my favorite part.</font>

655
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,450
<font color="yellow">Ah, was it really?</font>

656
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,709
<font color="yellow">I wanted you to have
better parts like the chicken legs.</font>

657
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,600
<font color="yellow">- That's, again, your problem.
- What?</font>

658
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,030
<font color="yellow">How long have we been working together?</font>

659
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:24,950
<font color="yellow">You still don't know that
I like chicken neck?</font>

660
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,660
<font color="yellow">How can you be
that slow on the uptake?</font>

661
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,169
<font color="yellow">Figures, since you don't seem
to be bothered by the fact</font>

662
00:45:32,169 --> 00:45:37,010
<font color="yellow">that your classes have low numbers
and you impersonate celebrities.</font>

663
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,410
<font color="yellow">Gosh, that's your talent in a way.</font>

664
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,580
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

665
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,370
<font color="yellow">How can you say that?</font>

666
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,240
<font color="yellow">What? What did I say? What?</font>

667
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:50,769
<font color="yellow">Damn it. Couldn't you try
to please me at least today?</font>

668
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:51,910
<font color="yellow">What did I say?</font>

669
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,069
<font color="yellow">Because of my in-laws who talk
about work even on weekends</font>

670
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:57,399
<font color="yellow">I said I was so stressed out, didn't I?</font>

671
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:01,430
<font color="yellow">Well, how are you supposed to know</font>

672
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,819
<font color="yellow">the feeling that you have
to work on weekends?</font>

673
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:05,089
<font color="yellow">I do know what it's like.</font>

674
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:09,669
<font color="yellow">Now I really know
exactly what it feels like.</font>

675
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:11,689
<font color="yellow">I'm upset that my tears are overflowing.</font>

676
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:12,959
<font color="yellow">My sadness is overflowing.</font>

677
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:15,879
<font color="yellow">What's that? You said you didn't
impersonate on weekends.</font>

678
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:17,959
<font color="yellow">It's my weekend too.</font>

679
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,330
<font color="yellow">I felt like I was working this weekend.</font>

680
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:28,050
<font color="yellow">So my impersonation just came out.</font>

681
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:30,109
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

682
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:32,780
<font color="yellow">Let me pour you one.</font>

683
00:46:37,939 --> 00:46:39,249
<font color="yellow">What is it now?</font>

684
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:41,760
<font color="yellow">Why did the alarm go off?
It's not even 10:00 p.m. yet.</font>

685
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,439
<font color="yellow">I should go home earlier on weekends.</font>

686
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:45,300
<font color="yellow">- My wife is waiting for me.
- What?</font>

687
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,539
<font color="yellow">Wait, Professor Min.</font>

688
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,910
<font color="yellow">Pour me some first! Hey!</font>

689
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,149
<font color="yellow">Hey, Professor Min!</font>

690
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:52,050
<font color="yellow">Do you like your wife that much?</font>

691
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,510
<font color="yellow">Damn it.</font>

692
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,530
<font color="yellow">Gosh, I'm so lonely. So lonely.</font>

693
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,100
<font color="yellow">Cheers.</font>

694
00:47:23,269 --> 00:47:24,399
<font color="yellow">It's good.</font>

695
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,379
<font color="yellow">This is an honor.</font>

696
00:47:30,379 --> 00:47:34,120
<font color="yellow">I get to drink with you,
who always drinks solo.</font>

697
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,970
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I like drinking solo, like you.</font>

698
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,530
<font color="yellow">I saw your photos of drinking
alone at home on Instagram.</font>

699
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:42,819
<font color="yellow">Did you?</font>

700
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:48,859
<font color="yellow">I get tired from giving lectures all day.</font>

701
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:52,879
<font color="yellow">I couldn't love it more
that I drink beer alone.</font>

702
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,439
<font color="yellow">I don't have to talk any more.</font>

703
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,749
<font color="yellow">I don't have to hear others
talking about unnecessary stuff.</font>

704
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,939
<font color="yellow">I don't have to worry about others
and can pick the dish I like.</font>

705
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:04,330
<font color="yellow">I can enjoy a time just
for myself. A time of healing.</font>

706
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:07,120
<font color="yellow">Wow, we sure think alike.</font>

707
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:16,499
<font color="yellow">But I'm not
a master of drinking like you.</font>

708
00:48:16,499 --> 00:48:18,289
<font color="yellow">- I'm a master?
- Yes.</font>

709
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,879
<font color="yellow">I can drink alone at home just fine.</font>

710
00:48:20,879 --> 00:48:24,490
<font color="yellow">But I don't think I can
drink alone at a restaurant.</font>

711
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,300
<font color="yellow">I'm afraid people will stare at me
and wonder why I'm drinking alone.</font>

712
00:48:28,919 --> 00:48:30,839
<font color="yellow">Why does it matter what others think?</font>

713
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,499
<font color="yellow">Our lives are too short
to focus on ourselves.</font>

714
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:39,490
<font color="yellow">From now on, I will learn a lot from you,
a master of drinking solo.</font>

715
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,959
<font color="yellow">Drinking solo is good</font>

716
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:45,160
<font color="yellow">but isn't
drinking with someone good too?</font>

717
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,620
<font color="yellow">I like it.</font>

718
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,169
<font color="yellow">What's with
the tacky way of looking at me?</font>

719
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,249
<font color="yellow">It was for my joint class.</font>

720
00:49:30,249 --> 00:49:32,689
<font color="yellow">If your fingers get hurt
while opening the shrimp</font>

721
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:34,930
<font color="yellow">you won't be able to write on the board.</font>

722
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,120
<font color="yellow">I did that
to manage my joint class better.</font>

723
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,310
<font color="yellow">Our guess was right.</font>

724
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,510
<font color="yellow">He was a fellow student
who was rejected by you and got mad.</font>

725
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:05,390
<font color="yellow">And he committed that crime.</font>

726
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:11,970
<font color="yellow">You must have gone through a lot.</font>

727
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,100
<font color="yellow">But now we've caught the culprit.</font>

728
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,368
<font color="yellow">I hear there are companies
that delete unwanted photos.</font>

729
00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:21,810
<font color="yellow">If you hire them,
they will get rid of the photos.</font>

730
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,620
<font color="yellow">Hey, what's wrong?</font>

731
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,350
<font color="yellow">You've been tough all this time.</font>

732
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,390
<font color="yellow">Now everything is over. Why now?</font>

733
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:41,749
<font color="yellow">I don't know.</font>

734
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,919
<font color="yellow">I guess it's overwhelming now.</font>

735
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,260
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I was really scared.</font>

736
00:50:50,649 --> 00:50:52,729
<font color="yellow">And I'm still scared.</font>

737
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,990
<font color="yellow">I have to continue to study.</font>

738
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:58,939
<font color="yellow">I have to pass the exam.</font>

739
00:50:59,709 --> 00:51:01,879
<font color="yellow">What should I do now
when I'm still this scared?</font>

740
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,249
<font color="yellow">You seemed like such a tough girl.</font>

741
00:51:06,249 --> 00:51:08,249
<font color="yellow">Now you're more approachable.</font>

742
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:12,410
<font color="yellow">Get up.</font>

743
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,660
<font color="yellow">Stop. Stop crying.</font>

744
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:20,550
<font color="yellow">Now go easy on the guys.
As you already know</font>

745
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,289
<font color="yellow">when studying for exams,
it's a hard life and we're lonely.</font>

746
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:26,890
<font color="yellow">Why should you hurt their feelings
when they're already struggling?</font>

747
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,859
<font color="yellow">If I start dating
and do many other things here</font>

748
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,189
<font color="yellow">how am I supposed to pass?</font>

749
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:33,600
<font color="yellow">Agreed. You're right about that.</font>

750
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,319
<font color="yellow">But you can still find
a softer way to say no to them.</font>

751
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:38,680
<font color="yellow">"Oh, sweetie."</font>

752
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,470
<font color="yellow">"You should study only
now that you're in Noryangjin."</font>

753
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:43,260
<font color="yellow">- Like that?
- What?</font>

754
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,140
<font color="yellow">I will pass.</font>

755
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,749
<font color="yellow">Just listen to me, will you?</font>

756
00:51:46,749 --> 00:51:48,749
<font color="yellow">It's a scary world.</font>

757
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,510
<font color="yellow">There are a lot of psychopaths.</font>

758
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,050
<font color="yellow">You need to be careful.</font>

759
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,800
<font color="yellow">Thank you anyway.</font>

760
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,439
<font color="yellow">I will never forget what you did for me.</font>

761
00:51:56,999 --> 00:51:59,260
<font color="yellow">It's okay to forget what I did for you.</font>

762
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,640
<font color="yellow">Just apologize to Ki Bum.</font>

763
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,999
<font color="yellow">Let's go.</font>

764
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,740
<font color="yellow">Really? You've caught the culprit?</font>

765
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,629
<font color="yellow">Wow, good job, Jin Gong Myung.</font>

766
00:52:21,629 --> 00:52:23,410
<font color="yellow">Thanks to you, I cleared my name.</font>

767
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:24,810
<font color="yellow">You're my best friend, after all.</font>

768
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,990
<font color="yellow">All right then.</font>

769
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:30,819
<font color="yellow">She suspected that I was the one?</font>

770
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,749
<font color="yellow">I will hate her for the rest of my life.</font>

771
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,339
<font color="yellow">Bad luck, Jung Chae Yeon.</font>

772
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:39,069
<font color="yellow">Hey, Jung Chae Yeon has smoking legs.</font>

773
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:41,019
<font color="yellow">Her breasts aren't
as big as I imagined though.</font>

774
00:52:41,019 --> 00:52:42,810
<font color="yellow">But her face makes up for it.</font>

775
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,740
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I wish they would never
catch the one who did that.</font>

776
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,589
<font color="yellow">That way, we can see more photos of her.</font>

777
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:50,589
<font color="yellow">I sent all my friends the photos of her.</font>

778
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:51,839
<font color="yellow">They all loved them.</font>

779
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,850
<font color="yellow">You don't have to say.</font>

780
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,339
<font color="yellow">The guys are all over it
even in my chat room.</font>

781
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,684
<font color="yellow">You trash!</font>

782
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:10,780
<font color="yellow">It's a crime
that someone took those photos.</font>

783
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,620
<font color="yellow">It's also a crime to send them around.</font>

784
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,229
<font color="yellow">Delete them all when I ask nicely.</font>

785
00:53:14,229 --> 00:53:15,810
<font color="yellow">- Who are you?
- Who am I?</font>

786
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,780
<font color="yellow">I'm a future civil servant, you losers!</font>

787
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,209
<font color="yellow">You should study only
now that you're in Noryangjin.</font>

788
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,611
<font color="yellow"><i>[Patient: Kim Mee Kyung]</i></font>

789
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:46,999
<font color="yellow">I'm here.</font>

790
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:57,229
<font color="yellow">You don't know who I am?</font>

791
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:03,769
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

792
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:06,859
<font color="yellow">I come by every day to see you.</font>

793
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:08,089
<font color="yellow">How can you not recognize me?</font>

794
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,019
<font color="yellow">Look at me.</font>

795
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,519
<font color="yellow">I'm your son, Jin Woong.</font>

796
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,499
<font color="yellow">Ta-da.</font>

797
00:54:16,499 --> 00:54:19,339
<font color="yellow">And these are your favorite flowers,
chrysanthemums.</font>

798
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:22,069
<font color="yellow">These are chrysanthemums.
Aren't they pretty?</font>

799
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:34,229
<font color="yellow">Where is my daughter-in-law?</font>

800
00:54:35,459 --> 00:54:39,149
<font color="yellow">I miss my daughter-in-law.</font>

801
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,970
<font color="yellow">Mom, don't you remember?</font>

802
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,789
<font color="yellow">I got a divorce.</font>

803
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,830
<font color="yellow">No, it's not a good thing to remember.</font>

804
00:54:57,339 --> 00:54:59,959
<font color="yellow">It's better not to remember that.</font>

805
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,080
<font color="yellow">Don't you agree?</font>

806
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,209
<font color="yellow">Mom.</font>

807
00:55:03,729 --> 00:55:06,800
<font color="yellow">Lie down on your back.
I will massage your legs.</font>

808
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:09,850
<font color="yellow">Easy. Easy.</font>

809
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,280
<font color="yellow">Your legs, please.</font>

810
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:58,879
<font color="yellow">I didn't know how much
I'd enjoy drinking with him.</font>

811
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,910
<font color="yellow">By the way, what's up with him?</font>

812
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,120
<font color="yellow">Why is he so nice to me?</font>

813
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,580
<font color="yellow">"It's to manage our joint class better."</font>

814
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,999
<font color="yellow">He keeps saying that.</font>

815
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:10,100
<font color="yellow">Is it okay to be this nice to me?</font>

816
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,970
<font color="yellow">I hope everyone who's watching
these fireworks will pass the exam.</font>

817
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,620
<font color="yellow">Make sure you button
it up too, okay?</font>

818
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:28,530
<font color="yellow">Here.</font>

819
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:32,399
<font color="yellow">I don't know what you will celebrate.</font>

820
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:33,910
<font color="yellow">But drink it when you get to.</font>

821
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,069
<font color="yellow">Seriously?</font>

822
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,240
<font color="yellow">Like Jin Yi and Professor Min said</font>

823
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,010
<font color="yellow">does he have feelings for me?</font>

824
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,189
<font color="yellow">That's right.</font>

825
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:48,240
<font color="yellow">I'm not a leading actress in a TV drama.</font>

826
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,990
<font color="yellow">I'd be a fool not to notice
when he's that nice to me.</font>

827
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:53,769
<font color="yellow">I'm positive.</font>

828
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:03,030
<font color="yellow"><i>I like drinking solo.</i></font>

829
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:13,319
<font color="yellow"><i>A drink you enjoy
at the end of a tough day</i></font>

830
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:17,399
<font color="yellow"><i>is like a spell that makes us
forget the bad things.</i></font>

831
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,800
<font color="yellow"><i>If I drink solo,
it can heal my wound. </i></font>

832
00:58:02,959 --> 00:58:04,979
<font color="yellow"><i>It makes me feel
like I have a friend</i></font>

833
00:58:04,979 --> 00:58:07,379
<font color="yellow"><i>who will comfort my sorrow without words.</i></font>

834
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,379
<font color="yellow">Why bother going home early?</font>

835
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:27,859
<font color="yellow">I will have nothing to hear
but my in-laws nagging.</font>

836
00:58:36,899 --> 00:58:42,640
<font color="yellow">Gosh, none of my family calls
to check up on me until this hour.</font>

837
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,729
<font color="yellow">Why would they need me anyway?</font>

838
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:53,589
<font color="yellow"><i>When you have no one
to lean on in your everyday life</i></font>

839
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:55,819
<font color="yellow"><i>You might be comforted to think</i></font>

840
00:58:55,819 --> 00:58:58,729
<font color="yellow"><i>drinking solo feels like
you have a good friend. </i></font>

841
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:03,680
<font color="yellow"><i>That's why I like drinking solo.</i></font>

842
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:19,810
<font color="yellow"><i>But why am I drinking
with that woman today?</i></font>

843
00:59:32,439 --> 00:59:33,734
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

844
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,390
<font color="yellow">I should pull myself together.</font>

845
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:38,959
<font color="yellow">I ended up kissing you
by accident last time.</font>

846
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,138
<font color="yellow">It's okay to make the same mistake again.</font>

847
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,039
<font color="yellow">Sorry.</font>

848
00:59:57,825 --> 00:59:59,039
<font color="yellow">I should pull myself together.</font>

849
00:59:59,569 --> 01:00:02,439

851
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,769
<font color="yellow">What?</font>

852
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:30,899
<font color="yellow">Even if it was an accident to you</font>

853
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:33,249
<font color="yellow">it's good as long as I meant it.</font>

854
01:00:46,569 --> 01:00:47,939
<font color="yellow"><i>No Geu Rae.</i></font>

855
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,560
<font color="yellow"><i>Look, No Geu Rae.</i></font>

856
01:00:56,379 --> 01:00:59,810
<font color="yellow">What was that?
Why did you lift your head that way?</font>

857
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,830
<font color="yellow">I just had a stiff neck...</font>

858
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:14,700
<font color="yellow">I can take your girlfriend
to her place first, right?</font>

859
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,640
<font color="yellow">She's not my girlfriend.</font>

860
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:27,060
<font color="yellow">By the way, how come you
don't have a girlfriend yet?</font>

861
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,370
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

862
01:01:28,899 --> 01:01:31,649

how can I focus on my work?</font>

863
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,700
<font color="yellow">No Geu Rae, you should keep this in mind.</font>

864
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,560
<font color="yellow">While you're in my joint class</font>

865

<font color="yellow">Come to think of it</font>

867
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,260
<font color="yellow">you were so upset
when you thought I had a boyfriend.</font>

868
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,260
<font color="yellow">You said something and got angry.</font>

869
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:52,629
<font color="yellow">Can you be honest with me?</font>

870
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:56,620

why are you doing this? Why?</font>

<font color="yellow">You're drunk and seem out of your mind.</font>

894
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:02,470

something to lead her on.</font>

895

<font color="yellow">What did I ever do to her?</font>

896
01:03:03,569 --> 01:03:05,959

a ridiculous dream? Oh my gosh.</font>
