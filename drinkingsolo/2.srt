00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,560
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,610
I like drinking solo.

3
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,430
I talk all day long for my job.

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,740
Hence, I thoroughly enjoy not having to talk like this...

5
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,440
and wholeheartedly appreciate...

6
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,340
this moment of solitude.

7
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,270
I have my own rules for enjoying drinking solo.

8
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,640
First.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,010
I must have a quality time in a classy ambiance.

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,080
Second.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,440
There must be high-quality drink accompaniments.

12
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,070
Third. I seek to promote a mindful and high-quality drinking culture.

13
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,900
(Your blood alcohol content is 0.065 percent.)

14
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,610
I never drink until my blood alcohol content goes over 0.080 percent.

15
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,440
It's because...

16
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,340
that number represents when I feel happily tipsy.

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,640
- Let's toast our almighty chief.
 -  Goodness, guys.

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,780
- Cheers!
 -  Cheers!

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,240
I hate feeling obligated to drink...

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,710
to win favour of someone.

21
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,170
Drinking has to be...

22
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,280
an enjoyable experience.

23
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,070
He eats all sorts of delicious things alone.

24
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,490
High-quality Trash really gets on my nerves.

25
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,610
Are you the only one who eats crabs?

26
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,210
It's nothing to show off.

27
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,140
I should grab a beer and eat some crabs, too.

28
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,710
Look at you. You look deliciously plump.

29
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,710
Here goes one.

30
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,640
Now, two at the same time.

31
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,540
Three this time.

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,540
And many of them!

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,740
How many crabs did I just eat?

34
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,940
I didn't even have time to put on makeup.

35
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,870
There's nothing left.

36
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,690
- Did you do your homework?
 -  Yes.

37
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,240
Right. Did you read the post on Professor Jin's page...

38
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,680
that claims Professor Jin forged his academic credentials?

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,810
I did.

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,510
The person who wrote even said to have evidence.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,440
I know.

42
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,010
What is this?

43
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,970
He forged his academic credentials?

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,110
Whenever someone writes about it, it gets deleted.

45
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,110
He must be hiding something. Otherwise, he'd explain.

46
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,410
No way.

47
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,910
If that was true, he'd go to jail.

48
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,170
Hello.

49
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,270
Hi.

50
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,200
- Jin Yi.
 -  Ha Na, good morning.

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,330
Did you hear what they were talking about?

52
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,430
What do you mean?

53
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,970
- That Professor Jin lied?
 -  Yes.

54
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,040
I did read that thing.

55
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Forget about it.

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,860
That's just one of the false rumours that go around in Noryangjin.

57
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,550
Whenever someone becomes popular, the haters come up with rumours...

58
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,340
to harm his or her reputation.

59
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,490
I guess it's the same everywhere.

60
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,540
Ha Na.

61
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,910
- Why do you look so tired today?
 -  Me?

62
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,890
- My goodness.
 -  Look at you.

63
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,420
I stayed up all night preparing for my first class. Do I look terrible?

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,670
You look horrible.

65
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,340
Look at all those freckles. What will I do with you?

66
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:44,210
Although it was well predicted,

67
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:48,670
you're amazing, Professor Jin.

68
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,080
Why is he so amazing?

69
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,210
He never disappoints anyone.

70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,340
This is unbelievable.

71
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,010
Each of his classes attracted 1,000 students on average.

72
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,340
You're the star.

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,340
You're the hope.

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,710
- Professor Jin.
 -  Please excuse me.

75
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,610
First-class instructor is different, indeed.

76
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,770
How many students do I have?

77
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,210
You did a good job, too.

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,910
You have an average of 150 students per class.

79
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,540
150 students?

80
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,540
My goodness!

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,870
What about me?

82
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,670
I'm curious.

83
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,940
What are you doing?

84
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,040
Are you trying to imitate Song Joong Ki?

85
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,240
Yes, people say I look just like him.

86
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,310
Salute!

87
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,160
Who says something like that?

88
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,370
Why do you try to do impressions of celebrities?

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,600
I should do something different every class...

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,340
to keep my students interested.

91
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,170
Just prepare well for your classes instead.

92
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,440
You only have 50 students per class.

93
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,270
You barely managed to break even.

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Is that true?

95
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,510
It is true.

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,320
I should dispatch you somewhere far away.

97
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,370
Mr Kim. How many students do I have?

98
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,640
Is that true? Do I really have only 10 students?

99
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,710
Yes, it's true. How many times are you going to ask me?

100
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,800
It's a good thing we're not paying you a lot.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,370
You could have lost us money otherwise.

102
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,260
With one less student, your class would have been cancelled.

103
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,640
It barely managed to survive.

104
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,270
I see.

105
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,930
You should take into consideration that it hasn't been advertised well.

106
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,810
Having 10 students is better than nothing.

107
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,740
I agree. She did an okay job...

108
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,570
for being No Geu Rae.

109
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,970
No Geu Rae?

110
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,570
What's that?

111
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,240
It's a nickname I gave her.

112
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,810
I don't know a lot of things because I'm new.

113
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,440
You could teach me how things work.

114
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,240
What?

115
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,970
That's what Jang Geu Rae from "Misaeng" would say.

116
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,150
That's why I call her No Geu Rae.

117
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,210
She's Jang Geu Rae in Noryangjin.

118
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh my.

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,750
- Oh my.
 -  Professor Jin, that's hilarious.

120
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,180
It's so funny.

121
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,610
Are you No Geu Rae, Ha Na?

122
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,670
No Geu Rae?

123
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,210
(Don't give up right away!)

124
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,810
(Your dream will come true.)

125
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,640
(If you don't walk today, you'll have to run tomorrow.)

126
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,510
(Ju Yeon, I'll make sure to pass the exam for you.)

127
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,770
(50 dollars has been transferred from Kim Dong Hee's account.)

128
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,610
(Big sister: 50 dollars)

129
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,140
Dong Hee, I'll pay you back as soon as I pass the exam.

130
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,170
(Memo)

131
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,370
(Big brother: 30 dollars, Grandma: 30 dollars, Gong Myung: 20 dollars)

132
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,970
Until when will I have to receive help from my family?

133
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,110
For my family...

134
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,710
and Ju Yeon, I'll pass the exam by all means.

135
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,310
By all means!

136
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,310
My goodness.

137
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,560
What are you doing here?

138
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,110
I came to wake you up.

139
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,910
You woke up early today.

140
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,100
Of course.

141
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,710
My classes start today. I should study hard from now on.

142
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,920
Look at you.

143
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,210
I like your attitude.

144
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,270
Do you like my attitude?

145
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
What are you talking about?

146
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,710
Get out right now!

147
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,180
Look at you.

148
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,740
It's not like you have anything to hide. Don't be so sensitive.

149
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,810
Get out.

150
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,570
Does he have the right to say that?

151
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,440
The myth of Dangun.

152
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,210
It's a story about a bear who turned into a human.

153
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm sure you all have heard of it.

154
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,740
I'll tell you what the exam will ask you about.

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,970
There was a tribe that worshipped the sky.

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,370
- The classroom is full.
 -  Another tribe worshipped bears.

157
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,690
There was also a tribe that worshipped tigers.

158
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,140
This is why he's a first-class instructor.

159
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,950
- The tribe...
 -  What?

160
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,540
If I work hard, I'll have that many students someday.

161
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,740
Jin Jung Suk, wait and see...

162
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,610
what No Geu Rae is capable of.

163
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,970
Dangun.

164
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,640
It means...

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,340
You start working at the academy today, right?

166
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,980
How much discount do you get by doing that?

167
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,140
It's not just a discount. I take classes for free.

168
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,840
Really? That's a good deal.

169
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,970
Hey, Chae Yeon!

170
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,430
Do you remember me? We were in the same class once.

171
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,420
I want to be friends with you.

172
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,510
Can you give me your phone number?

173
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,810
I already said no.

174
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,680
Don't be like that.

175
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,410
Fine. Give me your phone.

176
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,900
- What did you just do?
 -  If you're here to study,

177
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,970
focus on your studies.

178
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,240
Wow, that charisma.

179
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,550
No matter how cold she is, she's still popular.

180
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,840
As long as a girl is pretty, nothing seems to matter.

181
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,640
Does she look pretty to you?

182
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,540
Are all guys blind?

183
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,540
I've never thought she's pretty.

184
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,640
What? She's the prettiest girl in Noryangjin.

185
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,040
The prettiest girl?

186
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,080
She's the meanest girl.

187
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,210
Everyone here must be going crazy from studying too much.

188
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,110
How can they think she's pretty?

189
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,670
What's wrong with him? She's super pretty.

190
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,870
Why does he hate her so much?

191
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,320
Hey, make sure you do a good job.

192
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,340
- It's our Professor Pretty's class.
 -  Professor Pretty?

193
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,940
Look.

194
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,810
Isn't she hot?

195
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,010
You don't call a girl like her pretty.

196
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,310
This is a pretty girl.

197
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,640
I signed up for this class just to see her in real life.

198
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,440
She's my type.

199
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,540
I love you.

200
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,410
This is not a girl band's concert.

201
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,150
Whatever.

202
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,970
It's none of your business.

203
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,170
Where did this girl go?

204
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,070
Isn't she her aunt?

205
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,540
I thought she'd look like this.

206
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,410
Why does she look so tired and old?

207
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,140
It's nice to meet you.

208
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,870
I'm your Korean teacher, Park Ha Na.

209
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,560
Thank you so much for choosing to take my class...

210
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,570
even though I'm not famous.

211
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,200
I'll do my best not to let you down.

212
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,310
Should we start? Here we go!

213
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,240
Today, we'll study about...

214
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,490
the standard language.

215
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:48,480
(This is annoying. The picture was filtered.)

216
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,640
The reason is...

217
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,510
Professor.

218
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,440
You should return the microphone.

219
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,440
What?

220
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,550
Oh, I see. Thank you.

221
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,710
Thank you.

222
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,610
Why do you need a microphone?

223
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,130
You only have 10 students.

224
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,220
You could probably whisper and everyone would hear it.

225
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,550
It must feel cosy and friendly. That must be nice,

226
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,570
No Geu Rae.

227
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,320
Yes, sure.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,890
I may look like a No Geu Rae for now,

229
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,000
but you just watch.

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,430
I'll make sure my classes are full very soon.

231
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,570
See you later.

232
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,610
Why is she so confident?

233
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,310
She's so clueless.

234
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,370
High-quality Trash.

235
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,600
I used to be a popular instructor at the previous academy.

236
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,810
There wasn't a single student...

237
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,760
that would quit my classes midway.

238
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,200
I want to cancel my course with Professor Park Ha Na.

239
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,780
I want a refund.

240
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,960
What do you mean by a refund?

241
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,830
- What is going on?
 -  Do you have a reason?

242
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,440
Of course I do.

243
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,770
Look.

244
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,790
I was very excited...

245
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,070
to take her class after seeing this photograph.

246
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,270
However, her real face isn't like this at all.

247
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,550
Just take the class.

248
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,610
No way.

249
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,640
If it's going to be like this, I'll give up on looks.

250
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,220
I'd rather take Professor Lee Seon Jae's...

251
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,770
Korean class instead.

252
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,370
Hey, kid!

253
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,540
What did you just say?

254
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
You're going to give up on looks to take Professor Lee's class?

255
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,160
Professor Lee is as beautiful as a gem.

256
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,130
How dare you talk lowly of her looks?

257
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,970
Yes, I'm Lee Sun Jae. Do you know who you're dealing with here?

258
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,550
I know.

259
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,540
I know that very well.

260
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,090
There's not a soul in Noryangjin that doesn't know you.

261
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,760
You must be upset.

262
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,840
Let's go.

263
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Anyway,

264
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,170
give me a refund.

265
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,050
Hold on a minute.

266
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,430
Can we talk?

267
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,910
Come here.

268
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,410
Hey.

269
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,670
Are you that disappointed with my face?

270
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,930
Enough for you to ask for a refund?

271
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,410
To be honest,

272
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,770
it was filtered too much with Photoshop.

273
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,550
It's not all Photoshop.

274
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,670
I slept in today,

275
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,910
so I didn't get to prepare properly this morning.

276
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,210
I'm just like that with proper makeup.

277
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,320
Anyway, why does an instructor's face matter so much?

278
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
What matters is how well they teach.

279
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,190
Ever since I was in high school,

280
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,260
I can focus better if my teacher is pretty.

281
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,510
I also get good marks.

282
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,670
I'll become prettier.

283
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,410
Hey,

284
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,840
can you help me persuade your friend?

285
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,790
Thank you for the food. Goodbye.

286
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,960
Why? Wait for me.

287
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,870
No, I don't have the time. I have to go study.

288
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,610
Professor Park,

289
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,940
can you really become prettier?

290
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,200
Of course. Just trust me.

291
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,210
I'm not sure if that's possible.

292
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,870
We're out of pickles. Let me get some more for you.

293
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,610
Now she's bending over backwards for the students, too.

294
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,170
She's so lowly.

295
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,410
Did he hear everything?

296
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,240
Gosh.

297
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm pathetic, right?

298
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,640
I was begging...

299
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,770
a student to take my class.

300
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,240
Why did High-quality Trash have to be there?

301
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,380
He already thinks that I'm dying to flatter everyone.

302
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,660
Now that misconception will look true.

303
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,110
What should I do?

304
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,540
Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do to console you.

305
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,130
As for me,

306
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,760
I get sensitive sometimes when you leave me...

307
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,310
flipped upside down.

308
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,050
What are you doing? Why are you complaining?

309
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,600
I'm already overwhelmed as it is.

310
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,570
Why are there so many annoying things happening?

311
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,380
Do you want to read cartoons?

312
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,570
- I can load the next episode...
 -  I'm not in the mood for that.

313
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,610
Forget it. Why do I even bother?

314
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,770
(Gong Myung)

315
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,310
What? You can't come?

316
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,240
Are you going to be like this?

317
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,110
I'm totally serious.

318
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:53,070
I had a huge fight with Mum then I walked out.

319
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,250
Why do you think?

320
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,710
She keeps nagging at me to take the civil service exam.

321
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,660
Dong Young, come on.

322
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,030
Be a good friend.

323
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,930
Come on, can't you be considerate?

324
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,260
You know my family is saving up to help me study.

325
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,320
I feel so bad. I need to pass the test as soon as possible.

326
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm hanging up.

327
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,610
Hey.

328
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,140
Gosh, he's so stern.

329
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,910
I need him to come out.

330
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,910
- That game's more fun with others.
 -  Of course.

331
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,700
Well? Should I call him again?

332
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,810
It's no use.

333
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,710
I told you, he's really determined.

334
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,510
I think he'll pass this time.

335
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,570
Brutal.

336
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,860
Ki Bum, did you give up?

337
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,880
What are you talking about?

338
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,170
I was planning to study when you called me out.

339
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,960
You told me to meet you here if I don't have a place to go.

340
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,110
Did I?

341
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,440
Forget it.

342
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,040
I should have ignored you even if you ran away from home.

343
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,210
I was going to study so hard starting today.

344
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,000
How come I can't be as determined as Dong Young?

345
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,150
That's because...

346
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,610
your family is too rich.

347
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,620
Your family's supporting you. It's hard to be spiteful.

348
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,040
Look at Dong Young.

349
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,270
Look at how desperate he is.

350
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,710
You need to be pushed to the edge to be determined.

351
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,300
You're right.

352
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,430
I have to be desperate.

353
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,640
That's it.

354
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,060
That's why I wasn't eager enough to study.

355
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,410
Come with me.

356
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,170
What is it?

357
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,440
Where are you going?

358
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,880
I'm trying to study to become a Grade 9 Public Official.

359
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,970
I don't know which classes to take.

360
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,830
People told me to take Professor Lee's class for Korean.

361
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,970
I see.

362
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,700
What do you think about our pre-set joint classes?

363
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,060
This is a joint class...

364
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,880
organised by Professor Lee Seon Jae.

365
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,900
They have a set schedule like school classes.

366
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,620
All you need to do is take this in order to get ready for your exam.

367
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,670
- The price is...
 -  I'm so jealous of them.

368
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,310
- Why?
 -  Why do you think?

369
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,310
If you're a part of a joint class with a first-class instructor,

370
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,950
a lot of students sign up automatically,

371
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,770
and you naturally become more well known.

372
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,010
- There's no reason to be jealous.
 -  Pardon?

373
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,400
You'll soon become beneficiaries of a first-class instructor.

374
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,940
Beneficiaries?

375
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,570
What do you mean?

376
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
Pardon?

377
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,260
The three of us will be in a joint class with Professor Jin?

378
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,480
Yes.

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,940
That's why I put you all in the same staff room.

380
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,350
Try to make...

381
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,520
the best joint class while working with Professor Jin.

382
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,040
- Thank you, Sir.
 -  We'll do our best.

383
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,870
Didn't around 1000 students...

384
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,130
sign up for Professor Jin's regular classes?

385
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,670
Will as many students sign up for the joint class?

386
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,330
- I assume so.
 -  Then...

387
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,380
that means we'll be lecturing in front of 1000 students as well.

388
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,660
Are we getting a raise?

389
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,400
Why are you even asking me?

390
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,830
I'll give you an incentive per student.

391
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,070
Of course the price may differ due to your experience levels.

392
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,830
I'll go get Professor Jin.

393
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,130
Gather around the table.

394
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,040
We'll talk more about this in detail with him.

395
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,710
Yes, Sir.

396
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,770
Salute.

397
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,900
I feel like we won the lottery.

398
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,420
That's what I mean.

399
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,340
How did such an opportunity come to me? I can't believe it.

400
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,970
What is it now?

401
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,840
Why are you shopping for track jackets?

402
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,740
I just got this month's allowance yesterday.

403
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,510
I'm going to use it all up.

404
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,140
If I become penniless,

405
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,320
I'll become desperate like Dong Young.

406
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,430
What?

407
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,810
If Dong Young is poor by nature,

408
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,360
I'll just use all I have...

409
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,140
to acquire poverty.

410
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,380
This looks really cool.

411
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,070
I'll get this.

412
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,970
I'll also get the one beside it.

413
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,670
Are you Paris Hilton of Noryangjin?

414
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,610
How many of these are you getting? Are you crazy?

415
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,210
Don't you know there are so many places you could use money?

416
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,240
You're clueless, aren't you?

417
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,700
Track suits are the pride for students preparing the exam.

418
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,040
It's like your business card if you're working at the office.

419
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,940
Look at him.

420
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Over there.

421
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,510
I saw that jacket at an outlet mall two years ago.

422
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,570
That means he's be preparing for the exam...

423
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,440
for at least three years.

424
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,440
Look. Look at that guy.

425
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,220
You can't find that suit even at an outlet mall.

426
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,040
He must have been preparing...

427
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,640
for at least five years.

428
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,110
- What are you doing?
 -  What do you think?

429
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,870
I can tell how long they've been studying just by their clothes.

430
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,710
Look at him. Look.

431
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,180
That's the new fall collection.

432
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,090
That means he just recently moved to Noryangjin.

433
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,510
Look at how clean he looks.

434
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,670
He's so enthusiastic as if he'd pass his exam tomorrow.

435
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,720
I want to...

436
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,070
look like a newbie, just like him.

437
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,970
That looks really cool.

438
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,240
Excuse me, do you have my size in that?

439
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,910
You're really something.

440
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,260
You don't want to be part of the joint class?

441
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,840
What do you mean?

442
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:10,610
Let's step out for a bit.

443
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,770
- Let's talk outside.
 -  There's no need.

444
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,970
I'll make myself clear in front of everyone.

445
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,640
I'm not interested in doing a joint class with these instructors.

446
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,770
Why are you being like this, Professor Jin?

447
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,640
Do you really not know the reason?

448
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,770
Even if you combine all of their classes,

449
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,940
the total number of their students is less than 200 per class.

450
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,240
Why do I have to sacrifice myself to help these instructors?

451
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,240
The employment contract you signed clearly states that you have to...

452
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,660
actively participate in these joint classes.

453
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,410
I specified that I must have a say in selecting whom I'll work with.

454
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,440
Students will choose to take the joint class because of my name.

455
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,340
I'd like to work with competent instructors whom I approve,

456
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,870
not with these mediocre instructors.

457
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,570
Wait, Professor Jin.

458
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,820
Just a moment, okay?

459
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,420
That jerk...

460
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,410
Professor Jin, Professor Jin!

461
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,440
Professor Jin!

462
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,270
What a psycho.

463
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,200
He's really High-quality Trash.

464
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,440
Indeed.

465
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,660
Get off your high horse, you first-class instructor.

466
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,070
Does he think he's entitled to be condescending to us?

467
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,510
That's what I'm saying.

468
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,740
Ha Na, why aren't you saying anything?

469
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,170
Aren't you angry?

470
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,840
What can I say?

471
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,210
I'm a newbie who's just starting out in Noryangjin.

472
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,870
It's natural that I'm not being accepted.

473
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,040
What are you talking about?

474
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,420
In these joint classes,

475
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,410
famous instructors help and support instructors who are not well known.

476
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,210
Don't you know the phrase, "noblesse oblige"?

477
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,970
My blood is boiling. I can't let it slide.

478
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,790
Let's take revenge against High-quality Trash.

479
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,170
Revenge? How?

480
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,140
Let's do something that will completely throw him off.

481
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,940
How about we hide all of the instant coffee in the office pantry?

482
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,840
Goodness! You think that'll throw him off?

483
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,240
He makes 10 million dollars a year. He won't even blink an eye over it.

484
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,950
He can easily afford to open a cafe.

485
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,010
You're right.

486
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,540
If that's the case...

487
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,690
Let's post malicious comments about him online.

488
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,640
Let's write about how horrible his classes are...

489
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,000
and what kind of nasty person he is.

490
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,760
Everyone should know that his nickname is High-quality Trash.

491
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,370
High-quality Trash! Hit enter.

492
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,010
Do you think he'll let it slide?

493
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,610
He'll track down the IP address and get back at us.

494
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,110
Come to think of it, it's very strange.

495
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,070
Why doesn't he do anything...

496
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,440
about the posts on him forging his academic credentials?

497
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,210
Really? There are posts accusing him of it?

498
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,870
Yes. He just deletes them as soon as they get posted.

499
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,550
I mean, we all know how he is. You'd think that he would have...

500
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,740
sued those people for defamation a long time ago.

501
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,010
Exactly.

502
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,710
Is he hiding something?

503
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,240
I know that we can look up all graduates' names...

504
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,570
on the alumni association's website.

505
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,810
Ha Na, didn't you say that your cousin...

506
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,410
graduated from Seoul National University?

507
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,940
He did, right?

508
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,040
Yes. He did, but...

509
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,940
Ask him what his username and password are.

510
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,180
- Hurry up.
 -  Sorry?

511
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,440
I don't know how I feel about that.

512
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,770
I feel as though we're doing a background check on him.

513
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,400
What's wrong with doing a little bit of background check?

514
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,640
Ask him. Come on!

515
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,170
(Jin Jung Suk's Page: A new post has been published.)

516
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,040
(Professor Jin Jung Suk forged his academic credentials!)

517
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,240
(He did not graduate from Seoul National University.)

518
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,840
(Are you sure you want to delete this post?)

519
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,340
(Yes)

520
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,570
(Seoul National University Alumni Association)

521
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,370
(Search an alumnus: Jin Jung Suk)

522
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,770
(Your search yielded no results.)

523
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,640
- My gosh!
 -  What is this? My goodness.

524
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,910
There's no graduate with that name.

525
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,060
Did you type his name correctly?

526
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,940
- You didn't misspell his name?
 -  Are you blind or what?

527
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,740
It only took us this one simple search to find out that he's lying.

528
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,340
He probably didn't think that anyone would go to this extent.

529
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,740
Let's go. We must tell Mr Kim immediately.

530
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,910
- Yes, we should.
 -  Hold on a second.

531
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,170
He's been deleting the posts himself, so he must know about it.

532
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,710
How about we let him resolve this issue on his own?

533
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,850
I mean, he might confess to all of us soon.

534
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,350
He might confess? Cut the nonsense.

535
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,440
If that was the case, he wouldn't be that nasty about working with us.

536
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,870
Look at him with his nose in the air.

537
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,830
Besides, this isn't only about getting back at him.

538
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,140
Our students come here to study for their future.

539
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,870
Deceiving people like that is just wrong.

540
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,700
That's true, but...

541
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,740
I get it. You might be uncomfortable with getting involved in this.

542
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,050
You're still new, so you probably want to stay away...

543
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,110
from causing any sort of trouble.

544
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,610
Then...

545
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,640
you should stay out of it.

546
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,380
We'll take care of it.

547
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,540
Pardon? But that's...

548
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,280
I told you, didn't I?

549
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,610
I'm going to help and support you in every way I can.

550
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,840
Just let me handle it.

551
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,540
- Let's go, Professor Min.
 -  Okay.

552
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,070
Can I really stay out of it?

553
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,570
I don't even know any more.

554
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,870
I can't afford to worry about that trash's academic credentials.

555
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,910
I need to figure out my life first.

556
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,370
Am I being a coward right now?

557
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,910
Coward. Your search yielded following results.

558
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,430
A wimp. A person who lacks courage.

559
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,440
What? Wimp?

560
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,870
Wimp. Your search yielded the following results.

561
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,670
It refers to when a person exhibits personality traits or behaviours...

562
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,540
that can be described as ineffectual, powerless or timid.

563
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,610
What? Powerless?

564
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,960
I can't really deny it. I am powerless, indeed.

565
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,710
They're doing the right thing for people whose future depends on this.

566
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,240
I got out of it alone because I didn't want to risk my career.

567
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,410
Yes, this is wrong.

568
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,870
Those two have been so nice to me. I can't put it all on them.

569
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,610
That's right.

570
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,040
Mr Kim definitely needs to know this.

571
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,170
Mr Kim, you're here.

572
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,740
I need to talk to you about something.

573
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,940
What? What is it?

574
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
You want to be in Professor Jin's joint class?

575
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,870
Goodness. I actually was able to persuade him.

576
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,030
- He'll work with the two of you.
 -  Pardon me?

577
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,370
Well, I'm not 100 percent satisfied with you two,

578
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,410
but I do understand that there are no one who can take your place.

579
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,710
Hence, I made a tough decision.

580
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,640
You must do your best, though.

581
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,510
You'll be out if the quality of the class gets compromised.

582
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,570
That's correct.

583
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,010
Mr Kim. This is not what's important right now.

584
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,040
Yes, exactly. This isn't important at all.

585
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,570
Professor Jin. I know that you've been so understanding,

586
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,210
but could you also let Professor Park to join the class?

587
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,150
Gosh, I already told you that I can't do that.

588
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,370
How understanding do I have to be?

589
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,040
She is inexperienced and has a mediocre academic background.

590
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,540
I absolutely cannot work with that No Geu Rae.

591
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,770
Please consider giving her a chance...

592
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,730
Are you going on about my academic background again?

593
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,010
- When did you come in?
 -  Is it that important to you?

594
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,540
Is that why you forged yours?

595
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,220
I beg your pardon?

596
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,360
Professor Park!

597
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,510
What are you saying to a Seoul National University graduate?

598
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh, I guess you haven't heard.

599
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,370
Professor Jin forged his academic credentials.

600
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,510
What?

601
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,340
(Your search yielded no results.)

602
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,410
How are you going to explain this?

603
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,740
No one with your name graduated from Seoul National University.

604
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,310
Professor Jin, could you please explain this?

605
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:10,610
- Please say something.
 -  Yes.

606
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,910
Say something.

607
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,010
(Please enter a name.)

608
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,640
(Jin)

609
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,210
(Jin Sang)

610
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,740
(Korean History Major, Graduated)

611
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,330
Back in the ancient days, royal meals were called "jinsang".

612
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,410
That's right.

613
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,970
(Identification Card, Jin Sang)

614
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,140
What... What is this, Professor Jin?

615
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,570
It's my real name.

616
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,670
Jin Sang is my birth name.

617
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,870
I started using, Jin Jung Suk, when I first came to Noryangjin.

618
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,540
Seriously?

619
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,510
Are you serious? Are you really...

620
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,710
Is Jin Sang seriously your real name?

621
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,270
Yes.

622
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,810
My ex-boss strongly recommended using a different name.

623
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,310
I didn't think much about it and agreed to it back then.

624
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,800
Anyway, it's my fault.

625
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,250
What's wrong with Jin Sang? Why did your ex-boss want you to change it?

626
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,970
That ex-boss of yours is seriously so ridiculous.

627
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,840
- Are we good now, No Geu Rae?
 -  Well...

628
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,710
I'm very sorry, Professor Jin.

629
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,870
Forget it. This confirms my decision.

630
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,140
We'll never be in the same joint class.

631
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,340
You're incompetent, and all you do is dig up people's past.

632
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,220
I absolutely do not want to work with you.

633
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,340
Who told you such groundless rumour anyway?

634
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:57,490
You two. Is this what you wanted to talk to me about?

635
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,720
Did you two know about this, too?

636
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,340
No, not at all.

637
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,940
I've never heard such rumour.

638
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,440
Same here. This is the first time I'm hearing it.

639
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,520
Look.

640
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,300
If you're broke, go study. Why are you drinking?

641
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,420
Hey.

642
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,890
You ran away from home. I couldn't leave you behind.

643
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,360
I should have a drink with you.

644
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,840
Cut it out. You just want to drink.

645
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,570
You got me.

646
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,440
I don't know what's wrong with me.

647
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,270
I thought I'd focus on studying once I become broke,

648
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,160
but I was wrong.

649
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,790
Forget it. Try calling Dong Young.

650
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,200
He needs to eat, too.

651
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,210
Should I?

652
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,990
I'm having dinner with Gong Myung.

653
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,130
Join us.

654
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,590
Even if you have to study hard, you still need to eat.

655
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,130
Squid sashimi waits for you.

656
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,140
Squid sashimi?

657
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,040
(Ju Yeon, I'll make sure to pass the exam for you.)

658
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,500
I can't. I'm meeting Ju Yeon this weekend.

659
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,340
I have to meet this week's goal before that.

660
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,290
Gosh, he's so determined.

661
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,640
Then again, I can understand him.

662
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,860
He's been together with Ju Yeon for five years.

663
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,440
For two years, he was in the army. Now he's studying for an exam.

664
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,170
She's been taking care of him like a mum.

665
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,170
Wouldn't he want to pass the exam as soon as he can for her?

666
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,280
That's it.

667
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,010
What do you mean?

668
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,940
The reason why I don't want to study even though I'm broke is...

669
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,160
because I don't have a girlfriend.

670
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,020
- What?
 -  Think about it.

671
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,420
If I had a girlfriend,

672
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,110
I'd want to pass the exam to make her happy...

673
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,340
just like Dong Young.

674
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,010
Girlfriend.

675
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,840
Excuse me. Do you mind if I sit here?

676
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,760
Are you studying for the civil service exam?

677
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,200
So am I.

678
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,330
Why don't we drink together...

679
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,940
Gosh, I was already stressed out about my studies.

680
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,440
Get lost while I'm still nice.

681
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,110
Okay.

682
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,870
I see two beauties here.

683
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,170
- Why don't we...
 -  Get lost.

684
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
Okay.

685
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,310
Excuse me. I use that textbook, too. Why don't we...

686
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,340
Come here.

687
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,340
What are you doing?

689
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,330
I'm trying to get a girlfriend.

690
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,660
I need a girlfriend...

691
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,040
to motivate myself.

692
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
If you have time to motivate yourself, study instead.

693
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,910
I need motivation.

694
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,810
I said I couldn't go out.

695
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,810
(You have a message from Ju Yeon.)

696
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,910
Dong Young, this is Ju Yeon.

697
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm in front of the residence.

698
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,870
Can you come out?

699
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,010
Eat it up. You love samgyetang.

700
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,910
It's yours.

701
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,440
Also, you're busy with your work. You don't have to come here.

702
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,570
I'm really okay.

703
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,060
I came because I could.

704
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,480
Just eat.

705
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,510
Okay.

706
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,070
Slow down. You'll get an upset stomach.

707
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,540
I should eat it up and go back to studying.

708
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Dong Young.

709
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,780
Can't you stay with me a bit longer today?

710
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,070
What?

711
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,910
You don't seem to remember.

712
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,870
It's our fifth anniversary today.

713
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,170
That's right.

714
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:20,340
I'm sorry. I've been too preoccupied with my studies.

715
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,210
That's why you came.

716
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:23,880
Yes.

717
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,280
You should stay with me today, okay?

718
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,340
Okay.

719
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,510
Eat up.

720
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,100
What are you talking about?

721
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,900
Do you want to use your real name from now on?

722
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,040
It means exactly what I said.

723
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,310
I don't want rumours about me to go around.

724
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,030
Now that it's out in the open now,

725
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,510
I'd like go by my real name from now on.

726
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,610
Why are you doing this?

727
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,610
The name, Jin Jung Suk, has become a brand.

728
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,860
If you suddenly go by your real name,

729
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,710
it'll confuse the students.

730
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,970
What if you lose students?

731
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm ready to go through a bit of a transition period.

732
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,660
Why do I have to go through it together?

733
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,870
Why did you change your mind after starting to work with me?

734
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,370
I'm just wondering.

735
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,910
What's so funny to him?

736
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,170
Professor Jin must be thinking like this.

737
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,540
He's been using a false name.

738
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,240
"Should I apologise?"

739
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,870
"Should I confess?"

740
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:46,280
You're my everything

741
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,540
Like stars

742
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,570
Stop it!

743
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,620
Jin Jung Suk might turn into Jin Sang overnight.

744
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,300
Don't you realise how serious this is?

745
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,740
You're just happy about joining the joint class.

746
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,430
You're the real trouble.

747
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,620
Do you know that?

748
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,070
You're the real trouble.

749
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,090
What are you going to do now?

750
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,740
I hired you even though you were inexperienced...

751
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,310
in order to put you in Professor Jin's joint class.

752
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,830
How can you do this to me...

753
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,170
when you should bribe me?

754
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,340
What are you going to do now?

755
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,310
I'm sorry.

756
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,010
Professor Jin.

757
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,610
I'm sorry. I apologise.

758
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,860
- Forget it.
 -  Professor Jin.

759
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,510
Can we have a little talk somewhere?

760
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,740
Somewhere? Why?

761
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,090
Do you want to treat me to a meal...

762
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,760
just like you did to your students?

763
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,510
- What?
 -  You seemed to be good at sales.

764
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,300
Why don't you look into a sales career...

765
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,410
instead of desperately begging me like this?

766
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,170
Ha Na, we're sorry.

767
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,590
We shouldn't have encouraged you to reveal his truth.

768
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,060
You should have let us handle it.

769
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,510
Do you have to say that now?

770
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,740
Ha Na, why don't we go for a drink?

771
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,800
I better go home and prepare for classes.

772
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,310
Are you angry?

773
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,440
Because we pretended we hadn't heard of it?

774
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.

775
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,670
Never mind. I'm really okay.

776
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,760
If you're okay, drink with us.

777
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,720
You should.

778
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,500
We feel so bad about it.

779
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,230
- Let's have just one glass.
 -  I'm okay.

780
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,840
- Let's go.
 -  Let's go.

781
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,440
It's nice.

782
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,320
Do you remember this song?

783
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,860
When we went to a karaoke together for the first time,

784
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,780
you sang this for me.

785
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,010
Of course, I do.

786
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,640
I was so nervous that day.

787
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,840
We've been together for five years already.

788
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,970
You're right.

789
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,870
Time flies.

790
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,230
I have to go to the restroom.

791
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,240
Stay here.

792
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,110
- Go in.
 -  Okay.

793
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
Right.

794
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Here.

795
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,290
What is this?

796
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,550
It's a shirt.

797
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,970
You don't have many fall clothes.

798
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,040
I'm sorry I never give you anything back.

799
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,840
Don't worry. Go back to studying.

800
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,230
Okay. Take care.

801
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,240
Okay.

802
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,590
(Isak Residence)

803
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,040
Gosh. Please cheer up.

804
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,330
It doesn't matter even if you don't get into his joint class.

805
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,110
You can do well at your regular classes.

806
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,720
Enough with imitating others.

807
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,560
Jin Jung Suk is such a jerk.

808
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,450
Don't you agree?

809
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,320
Why won't he include you in his joint class?

810
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,970
It's okay.

811
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,160
It's still good news for you two.

812
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,350
Don't mind me and celebrate as much as you want.

813
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,080
Did we come here to celebrate?

814
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,210
No, we came here to cheer you up.

815
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,480
Affirmative.

816
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,250
This is all for you, Professor Park. Eat as much as you want...

817
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,820
and drink as much as you want.

818
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,250
Enough is enough.

819
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,520
This isn't "Descendants of the Sun".

820
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,710
You're more like "Slaves of the Sun".

821
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,780
I'm not doing this for nothing.

822
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,980
I'm trying to entertain Professor Park, that's all.

823
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,350
Thank you, Professor Min.

824
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,420
I feel better thanks to you.

825
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,780
Is that true?

826
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,450
"It was difficult, but I did it once again."

827
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,680
That's so funny.

828
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,020
Excuse me for a moment. I have to go to the restroom.

829
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,880
Gosh.

830
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:17,330
I'm so happy, but it's hard not to show it in front of her.

831
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,450
- It's so difficult.
 -  Gosh.

832
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,480
Why don't we have a toast while she's gone?

833
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,920
Congratulations, Professor Min.

834
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,880
You're going to lecture in front of 1000 students.

835
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,350
Same to you, Professor Hwang. Congratulations.

836
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Bottoms up.

837
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,720
(I'm sorry, Professor Jin. I want to apologise.)

838
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,580
He didn't read it yet.

839
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,250
What should I do?

840
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,480
(I was careless earlier...)

841
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,150
Thank you.

842
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,620
I was careless earlier.

843
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,050
Please let me apologise to you one more time.

844
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,960
She thought I wouldn't be useful to her...

845
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,490
and was accusing me on forging my academic credentials,

846
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,980
but now she's trying to flatter me.

847
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,520
She has no talent, but she tries to sneak her way in.

848
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,480
I hate her type.

849
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:50,020
(Five years ago)

850
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,950
What's this?

851
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,120
Did you stay here all night again?

852
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:59,180
What kind of feat are you trying to achieve?

853
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,420
You should go easy on yourself.

854
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,280
Good morning.

855
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,980
Good morning, Sir.

856
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,450
Hold on, Professor.

857
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,220
It's nothing much,

858
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,960
but my parents asked me to give this to you.

859
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,280
They got you a bottle of whisky from their trip abroad.

860
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,450
It's a 50-year-old limited edition.

861
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,680
Why did they bother?

862
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,480
It's not like it's 100 years old.

863
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,320
I'll go order another.

864
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,880
It's okay, I can't drink any more.

865
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,080
Can someone call me a designated driver?

866
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,120
There's no need.

867
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,050
I didn't have any drinks so I could drive you home.

868
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,180
Come with me.

869
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,550
We'll get going.

870
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,620
Watch out.

871
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:50,950
He's kissing up to the professor.

872
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,780
Congratulations on becoming a professor, Joon Seok.

873
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,680
- You should treat us.
 -  Thank you.

874
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,480
- Congratulations.
 -  Congratulations.

875
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,320
- I'll treat you guys out.
 -  Awesome.

876
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,780
- I thought you'd make it this time.
 -  Thank you.

877
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,520
Joon Seok.

878
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:08,050
Yes?

879
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,040
I read your thesis.

880
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,580
Why did you copy my research material?

881
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,890
I didn't copy it.

882
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,650
- I only referenced it.
 -  Why didn't you cite it, then?

883
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,980
I won't let you get away with this.

884
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,430
What are you going to do about it?

885
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,850
What will you do?

886
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,850
If people find out that you ruined me through a rumour,

887
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,720
do you think that will do you any good?

888
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,180
What did you say?

889
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,520
What's good is good.

890
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,720
Since I became a professor thanks to you, I'd help you in return.

891
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,180
I don't need help from an incompetent person like you.

892
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,180
I know I don't deserve it,

893
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,760
but I really hope you'd accept my apology.

894
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,450
I hate her type.

895
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,350
She's the worst.

896
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,420
I thought Professor Jin...

897
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,880
would be like trash per his nickname, but he's gold.

898
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,020
I agree.

899
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,620
Right, right.

900
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,620
What will you do with your incentive, Professor Hwang?

901
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,780
I'm going to get a new car.

902
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,650
I'll get a foreign import.

903
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,350
My lease is up this year.

904
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,480
Do you think I can get myself a new house?

905
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,620
My goodness. I'm so happy.

906
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,820
Gosh. If it wasn't for Professor Park,

907
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,340
we would be up there dancing and singing in celebration.

908
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:40,450
Well...

909
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,580
Why don't we sing one while she's away?

910
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,580
Shall we?

911
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,120
(I'm sorry, Professor Jin. I want to apologise.)

912
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,450
He's still not reading it.

913
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,780
If they come for me

914
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,530
At the age of 50

915
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,570
Tell them I can't go

916
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,080
Because I'm buying myself a new car

917
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:22,650
If they come for me

918
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,180
At the age of 60

919
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,330
Tell them I can't go

920
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,920
- Because I'm getting myself a house
 -  Because I'm getting myself a house

921
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,350
Professor Hwang. Professor Hwang.

922
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,020
- It's hot.
 -  My goodness.

923
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,650
Gosh, it's already 10pm.

924
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,180
- I'll get going.
 -  Are you Cinderella?

925
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,090
What are you doing?

926
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,980
Ha Na isn't cheered up yet. How can you leave?

927
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:06,680
You know how scary my wife is. I have to go.

928
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,480
- See you tomorrow.
 -  Bye.

929
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Wow. He's... What a coward.

930
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,950
Ha Na.

931
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:15,480
Let's drink on our own.

932
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,920
You're upset, right?

933
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,350
How can Professor Min...

934
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,850
just dash off like that and leave you?

935
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,150
My goodness.

936
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:29,920
Hold on.

937
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,720
Yes, Honey.

938
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,050
You're here to pick me up?

939
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,080
Okay, I'll be right there.

940
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:48,320
Gosh, why are all men like this?

941
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,820
They never ask and they come to pick you up on a whim.

942
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,680
They're so selfish.

943
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,220
- Should we get up now?
 -  What?

944
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,280
Okay.

945
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,450
Dong Young.

946
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,950
Let's not see each other any more.

947
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,650
I'm sorry.

948
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:49,950
I'm really sorry.

949
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,650
Dong Young.

950
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,150
Let's not see each other any more.

951
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,850
I'm sorry.

952
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,150
I'm really sorry.

953
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,770
I'm the one who should apologise.

954
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,310
I'm sorry for making you apologise to a guy like me.

955
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,070
Dong Young, I'm going to use the restroom quickly.

956
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,540
(Mum: Who knows when he'll pass the exam? You now have a job,)

957
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,710
(so you should find a better guy and get married. )

958
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,840
(Break up with him today, please.)

959
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,110
Dong Young!

960
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:48,340
This should've happened a long time ago.

961
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,210
I'm sorry that I couldn't let you go sooner.

962
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,040
I'm really sorry.

963
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,770
I'm so sorry...

964
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,810
that I can't be better than this.

965
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,850
I didn't order this, Ma'am.

966
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,210
That girlfriend of yours who used to come here with you all the time...

967
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,240
stopped by today and left a chunk of money with me.

968
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,210
She told me to give you...

969
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:42,340
the pork stir-fry dish you like every time you come.

970
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,370
Pardon me?

971
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,240
You have such a caring girlfriend.

972
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,210
You have to pass the exam this time to make her happy. Okay?

973
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,540
I drink solo because...

974
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,740
there aren't that many people in my life who can console me...

975
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,940
after a long, hard day and who can really...

976
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,040
understand me.

977
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,410
Hence, I'm not used to sharing my pain,

978
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,970
and I tend to internalise everything.

979
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:36,440
At times, grabbing a drink alone...

980
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,970
can console me more than anything.

981
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:43,710
That's why I drink solo.

982
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:52,810
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

983
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:54,840
My feet hurt.

984
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,240
(The Shortcut to Success, Jin Jung Suk's Korean History!)

985
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,840
(Professor Jin Jung Suk)

986
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,370
Did he get my message or what?

987
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,510
Right.

988
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,440
I wouldn't want to deal with me either if I were him.

989
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,900
I'm the ridiculous one.

990
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,340
I'm definitely the ridiculous one.

991
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,790
Ki Bum.

992
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,490
Just go in and study. Don't do anything stupid.

993
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,730
Look who's talking. Stop being so stupid and go home already.

994
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,840
Don't you think you're too old to run away from home like this?

995
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,210
Give me a dollar. I want to get a bottle of water.

996
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,210
What?

997
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,170
Here, take it.

998
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,210
What's she doing?

999
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,440
It's dangerous to fall asleep there.

1000
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,440
Gosh, seriously!

1001
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:10,940
(The Shortcut to Success, Jin Jung Suk's Korean History!)

1002
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,940
You jerk.

1003
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:15,010
Oh, right! That part-timer at a sashimi restaurant.

1004
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,210
Excuse me.

1005
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,770
- Wake up. You should go home.
 -  Gosh, yes.

1006
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,010
Gosh, that's the last bus! Sir, please wait!

1007
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:34,710
Don't leave yet, Sir! Please open the door.

1008
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,330
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1009
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,910
What just happened? Wasn't she dozing off here until just now?

1010
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:42,140
She's so fast.

1011
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,860
Excuse me! Please throw my shoes over here.

1012
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,940
- Oh, okay.
 -  Hurry up!

1013
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,280
Oh, no!

1014
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,340
Just throw them. Hurry up! My goodness!

1015
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,150
Isn't she the Korean instructor?

1016
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,440
The other one, too. Hurry!

1017
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:04,140
What are they doing right now?

1018
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,510
Gosh, my shoe!

1019
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,440
Hey, what was that about?

1020
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,670
Hey. You remember her, right?

1021
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,420
That part-timer who was taking her anger out on that advertisement.

1022
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,550
What?

1023
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,140
She's not a part-timer.

1024
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,840
She teaches Korean at the academy I go to.

1025
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,740
What?

1026
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
(Mum)

1027
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,840
Why does she keep calling me?

1028
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:37,440
- Just answer it, you fool.
 -  Hey! Goodness.

1029
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,040
Yes, Mother.

1030
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:44,140
Why?

1031
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,940
Gosh, what did you just say?

1032
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:56,610
Who is it at this hour?

1033
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,270
- Mum.
 -  I didn't hear a thing,

1034
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:06,760
so I got myself in.

1035
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,370
- I didn't know you were home.
 -  Right, sorry.

1036
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,110
What brings you at this hour?

1037
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,910
I have a favour to ask you.

1038
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,310
- A favour?
 -  It's nothing special.

1039
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:18,940
I want your little brother...

1040
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,410
to live with you until he gets a job in the government.

1041
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,430
- Sorry?
 -  What's this fool doing?

1042
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,670
Come in!

1043
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,110
- Come in.
 -  Mum, please.

1044
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:32,210
I want you to take care of this fool.

1045
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,810
(We'd like to thank all of the future government employees...)

1046
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,170
(whom we consulted for their help and guidance.)

1047
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,050
(Drinking Solo)

1048
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:12,860
Gong Myung will register at the academy you work at.

1049
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:15,660
I told him to go there because you work there.

1050
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,360
You'd better not tell anyone that you're my brother.

1051
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,730
If people find out that my brother is so hopeless and jobless,

1052
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,200
no one would want to take my classes.

1053
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,160
Do I seriously have to worry about how I look, too?

1054
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,360
I promised to become pretty. Will this be enough?

1055
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,730
Chae Yeon, you've been looking tired. This will energise you.

1056
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,530
- Take this.
 -  I told you that I don't want it.

1057
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,830
- Did you say 10,000 dollars?
 -  I need it for my rent deposit.

1058
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:35,130
I didn't get paid for three months at the other academy I worked at.

1059
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,710
Joining the joint class with Professor Jin...

1060
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,040
will solve all of my problems at one blow.

1061
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,330
I hate my life.

1062
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,140
Go and talk to High-quality Trash.

1063
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:42,340
It's not like I'm immune to shame.

1064
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,410
No, this can't be happening.

1065
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,640
- What is wrong with me?
 -  What's she doing?

1066
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,840
I'm embarrassed for her.

1067
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,230
I'll do my very best to make sure that every single one of you...

1068
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,040
will pass the exam.

1069
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,040
Cheer up, Professor Park.

1070
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,760
- Cheer up! Cheer up!
 -  Cheer up! Cheer up!

1071
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,730
- Thank you.
 -  Cheer up! Cheer up!

1072
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,870
Take Park Ha Na's Korean class!

1073
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:01,070
She'll tell you exactly what's going to be on the exam.

1074
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,320
What are you doing right now?

1075
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,040
Why do you even care?

1076
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,630
Are you out of your mind? Why are you distributing these?

1077
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:08,630
Professor Jin wants to talk to you at the terrace.

1078
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:10,410
I heard you want to speak to me about something.

1079
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:13,800
What is your problem?

1080
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,130
You said you wanted to let me know how sorry you really are.

1081
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,630
This must be what you actually wanted.

1082
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,060
What are you talking about? I don't know anything about this.

1083
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,300
No excuses, please. You're...

1084
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,870
a lot worse than I expected.
